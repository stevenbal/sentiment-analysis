text,sentiment
yeah yeah the advertisements didnt even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook sex,negative
neve campbell and starship troopers denise richards getting it on,negative
ok,negative
yeah its a decent two minutes of film erotica but even if thats your main interest in this film theres plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes,negative
wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however,negative
nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing or at least curious to see the next turn throughout the entire movie,negative
but this fastpaced razorsharp turning of events doesnt leave much time to enjoy the surprises,negative
we start off in a highclass california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making,negative
guidance counselor sam lombardo matt dillon seems to catch the eye of every student particularly kelly van ryan richards daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts,negative
right off the bat kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce mr lombardo,negative
the fundraiser car wash seems the opportune time particularly when you wash your guidance counselors jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure youll be soaked from head to toe when youre done,negative
on the weekend of the car wash kellys attempts at seduction fall flat and when they do she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day,negative
naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations,negative
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a lowclass marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller campbell comes forth with a near identical story also involving her trusted guidance counselor,negative
pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney ken bowden played by bill murray,negative
yes that bill murray,negative
sound like a good complete movie,negative
yes that alone could have been but this is just the beginning,negative
in fact the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film,negative
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time,negative
by the time the movie finishes you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable,negative
unfortunately with so much going on youre not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about,negative
this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it couldve been,negative
the 113 minutes fly by and although it never feels underdeveloped this pretzel of storytelling couldve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken,negative
the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox primetime soap operas which no is not a good thing,negative
and its not just campbell who happens to hail from the primetime fox soap party of five but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones,negative
dillon who was so charming in his understated role in last years in out gives the best performance and murrays surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film,negative
in fact if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy even if it was the exact same film i would actually give it a better grade,negative
thats how cheezy it comes off,negative
but aside from these two the rest offer nothing more than some good eyefulls,negative
in the right hands wild things couldve been a wickedly delightful scrumptiously twisted thriller but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting,negative
and whats up with these people passing as high school students,negative
i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles but when i realized it wasnt supposed to be a college they were at i had to snicker,negative
i wont lie this is definitely a guilty pleasure,negative
as corny as it is its got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a b for effort,negative
but if you just want to admire denise richards go for last years starship troopers which was every bit as campy but a million times better,negative
of course if seeing her breasts is your most important goal youll be right at home with wild things,negative
perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters,negative
senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a onejoke concept a bit too far,negative
director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies,negative
marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage,negative
however he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition scott thorpe david spade in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep an athletic record sponsorship by a fraternity and most of all a wealthy family to back him up,negative
in fact darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet,negative
but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel,negative
he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the universitys dr wheedon brad dourif,negative
as a result his senses are magnified tenfold,negative
using his newfound abilities he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job unaware that there may be some disadvantageous sideeffects to having super senses,negative
naturally marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle giving jim carreyish amounts of physical humor,negative
the problem is aside from a few genuinely inspired bits theres not much thats funny here,negative
the film has its one central gag and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor,negative
there obviously wasnt much thought put into the plot,negative
the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous,negative
i mean why the emphasis on extracurricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a singleelimination quiz anyhow,negative
and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester,negative
to give it credit senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryls roommate tim laflour matthew lillard,negative
apparently he is supposed to be faddish but the film never does anything with him leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie,negative
his intervention scenes with darryl however do provide a rare and welcome laugh,negative
and then theres the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one,negative
in this case the object of darryls amor is janice tamara taylor a fellow student who wont have anything to do with darryl until he gains his supersenses,negative
needless to say the romance is completely extraneous and adds little to the film,negative
this is a film that desperately needed something else,negative
be that a good plot more jokes or simply funnier ones or a strong character or two anything would have helped senseless get off the ground,negative
as it is all the manic exuberant mugging in the world cant help marlon wayans get this one off the ground,negative
this was the last carry on movie if you discount carry on columbus as a carry on movie and was made by a new production company,negative
based in central london this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert suzanne danielle to bed her husband emile the french ambassador kenneth williams,negative
when he seems unwilling she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes such as the prime minister and the u s ambassador,negative
her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages,negative
she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead,negative
meanwhile theodore valentine larry dann is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her,negative
however she is only interested in restoring her husbands ardour which seems a little difficult after emiles accident with a church spire,negative
this film is the second worst carry on movie the worst being carry on england,negative
it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written,negative
newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid as mrs valentine are mildly funny but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad,negative
kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted given the script,negative
the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler joan sims as mrs dangle kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur and peter butterworth as richmond are worthless and embarassing,negative
in fact all four parts are surplus to requirements,negative
however the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades,negative
an awful script a terrible collection of jokes very poor production values especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st james palace a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score and a nonexistent plot or storyline,negative
its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next,negative
jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile,negative
a complete waste of time this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies,negative
it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998,negative
avoid at all costs,negative
the rapidfire formula that worked so well in airplane the police squad,negative
television series top secret three naked gun films and two hot shots,negative
movies has finally reached a desperate deadend with spy hard,negative
even ezio gregios the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this overextended spy and actionmovie spoof,negative
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd40 who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis general rancor a cackling andy griffith,negative
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint timing or tact,negative
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags recreated movie sequences and soggy star cameos,negative
yeah maybe we do need ray charles driving an l a bus bound for a speed bump but did mr t hulk hogan and dr joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie,negative
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair,negative
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nuns habit even the resulting sister act spoof is silly,negative
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone pulp fiction true lies etc etc adolescent males might enjoy this mess tho,negative
the butt shots breast peeks penis pokes flatulence gags and related innuendo are right up beavis and buttheads alley,negative
beyond the hilarious title sequence with weird al yankovich performing the theme song spy hard is barely the stock that its printed on,negative
my recommendation duck in while youre waiting for another movie to start,negative
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird als nostril and then leave,negative
you wont miss a thing,negative
theres a scene early on in jawbreaker where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line that is so not funny,negative
how right she was,negative
this pathetic tale of three highschoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny,negative
or fun,negative
or original,negative
not content with the tooobvious heathers heisting the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources including carrie bride of frankenstein blue velvet and even shaws pygmalion itself recently remade as shes all that,negative
jawbreaker is a pastiche and not even an enjoyable one,negative
i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salts volcano girls serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage were watching,negative
just close your eyes and pretend youre listening to an altrock station you wont be missing anything,negative
the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals,negative
rebecca gayheart following roles in scream 2 and urban legend should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie,negative
pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantinos jackie brown,negative
and rose mcgowan should just quit acting,negative
she has no charisma no presence and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected,negative
mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her reallife boyfriend rocker marilyn manson whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the real actors are doing,negative
manson sans trademark makeup contact lenses and with an obviously fake moustache looks eerily like nicholas cage who woulda thunk it,negative
that crack about direction by committee wasnt merely a pithy soundbite,negative
stylistically thematically narratively jawbreaker is all over the map varying wildly in tone content from scene to scene,negative
though credited solely to darren stein one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands,negative
if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity someone needs to get the man some drugs pronto,negative
prozac lithium kava ritalin something anything,negative
hes quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help,negative
jawbreaker is a monumental waste of effort and resources and quite likely one of the single worst films ive ever seen,negative
to call jawbreaker garbage would be to insult garbage,negative
bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ive already got my pick for worst film of 99,negative
jawbreaker runs approximately 90 minutes though it feels longer than titanic and is rated r for language sexual situations and graphic violence,negative
not recommended for kids teens or anyone else,negative
the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow selfabsorbed and selfindulgent,negative
in other words they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts,negative
54 is the story of that wellpublicized new york disco studio 54 the inplace in the 70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled photographed and pampered,negative
the difficulty with 54 which was written and directed by mark christopher is that his script takes no point of view,negative
christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54s hallmark,negative
he keeps an uninvolved distance thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists,negative
the movies one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell the famous owner of the nightspot,negative
he is part rebel part dreamer part shrewd entrepreneur,negative
hes smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs,negative
myers in his first straight character part is in turn appealing and appalling,negative
at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash,negative
the story is told by shane oshea ryan phillippe a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple,negative
shades of john travoltas brooklynbound tony in saturday night fever,negative
eventually shane does come to new york attracts rubells eye and is admitted to the promised land,negative
his looks get him a job as a busboy and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous,negative
shanes dream is to meet soap star julie black neve campbell a fellow garden stater,negative
but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up its no big deal,negative
the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent,negative
54 is a very cold uninvolving movie,negative
its all strobe lights and glitz all substance,negative
its sort of like the musical era it covers,negative
this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation,negative
but lo and behold here comes switchback and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as kiss the girls and i know what you did last summer,negative
but switchback is an undoubtedly weak genre entry as the material it covers is old and tired and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting,negative
switchback opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child shes watching,negative
we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse dennis quaid and that the is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while,negative
he is promptly removed from the case but this conflict of interest doesnt keep him from offering pursuit,negative
lacrosses most recent trek takes him to a bloodsoaked hotel room in amarillo texas where the local sheriff r lee ermey is torn between his reelection campaign and helping his new ally catch his man,negative
in a related aside former railway worker bob goodall danny glover is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinupplastered even on the seatbelts el dorado,negative
along the way he picks up and subsequently saves the life of hitchhiking loner lane dixon jared leto,negative
this tangent isnt a random one as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself,negative
or is the villain in fact lacrosse only pretending to be after the coldhearted murderer he knows so much about,negative
in a sense thats half of the basic problem with switchback,negative
for its first hour the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator so were given little insight into who they are likely for fear that well learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction,negative
but switchback then decides to explicitly reveal the killers identity at its midpoint and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense,negative
some of the acting is a burdensome area as well probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves,negative
what is danny glover doing here grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot,negative
and dennis quaid,negative
that monotone stop it,negative
ermey is solid in a supporting role thats more interesting than the two leads thrown together but the charismatic leto claire danes object of affection in my socalled life is a scenestealer tried and true,negative
from a material standpoint switchback is pretty empty,negative
but even when firsttime director jeb stuart who wrote the fugitive and die hard doesnt know what to do he knows what he wants it to look like the movie provides some great visuals,negative
the setonatrain climax looks good even though the action is illogical and the beautiful crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor,negative
still thats not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond and more than the movies look will end up leaving you cold,negative
for original sin the road to the screen has been rocky,negative
initially slated for release last november the film was bumped twice finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001,negative
advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands,negative
so is original sin really all that bad,negative
yes it is but the melodrama does offer some rewards,negative
the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of ta with angelina jolie providing the t and antonio banderas the a,negative
more importantly the movie is entertainingly bad,negative
veteran readers know that as a rule i dont encourage people to patronize lousy films,negative
most of the time there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides the lets go laugh at the failings of others mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable,negative
but things are different this summer,negative
quality films to put it mildly have been few and far between so as far as im concerned its fair to find our kicks where we may,negative
original sin will never join such treasures as valley of the dolls road house and showgirls in the bad movie hall of fame but itll do until something worse comes along,negative
the film adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel waltz into darkness which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film mississippi mermaid opens in a turnofthecentury prison as jolies character slated for a dawn execution tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny,negative
the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like this is not a love story it is a story about love,negative
wary of local golddiggers cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas banderas makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign golddiggers,negative
a practical man luis chooses a frumpy looking lady hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children,negative
imagine his surprise when his fianc e julia russell jolie turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo,negative
julia explains that she sent a different womans image because she didnt want to be selected solely for her pretty face,negative
luis then confesses his deception leading julie to state with great significance we have something in common we are both not to trusted,negative
after their wedding luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible,negative
jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs to cover jolies crotch makes it look like hes trying to climb her,negative
luis the stupidest man who ever lived immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded,negative
his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up,negative
luis must force julia to write to her sister emily who is frantic over her lack of communication,negative
shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck,negative
finally when she cleans out his accounts and disappears luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong,negative
incidentally if youre afraid im giving too much away rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass,negative
along the way private detective walter downs played by thomas jane who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie 61 turns up hired by the frumpy womans sister to find out what happened to the real julia,negative
luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist having decided that if he cant have her he will kill her,negative
oh the pathos of it all,negative
the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story adjusting their performances accordingly,negative
banderas is suitably impassioned while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting and with those lips she can really pout,negative
as for thomas jane he starts off acting suspicious and cagey then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness,negative
his most startling moment comes when to prove his power to humiliate he forces luis against a wall verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a fullon kiss,negative
if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape show them this chilling scene,negative
and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler show them original sin,negative
return to horror high wants to be a couple different types of movies at once,negative
the film tells the story of a lowbudget horror movie being filmed at the closeddown crippen high a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before,negative
but what the cast and crew dont know is that a real killer maybe the same one that was never apprehended is going into action again,negative
on one level return to horror high is a slasher movie and it is at this level that it works the best on,negative
watching the film which was made in 1987 i couldnt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in scream and scream 2,negative
on another level the film wants to be a slapstick comedy and there are many hints of this throughout,negative
unfortunately most of these jokes fall flat,negative
and the last thing the film wants to be is a behindthescenes look at an exploitation film being made,negative
the only problem is that while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made no cameras are shown filming it thus making it far more confusing than it had to be,negative
and to top it all off the twist ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time,negative
there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through,negative
if you see the film or have seen it youll know what i mean,negative
the premise of return to horror high is admittedly pretty crafty and i liked the atmosphere of the school which is where the whole thing takes place,negative
but director froehlich judging from this movie is an incompetent director except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene,negative
well come to think of it there is only one scene that is actually scary and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in,negative
but other than that twominute distraction return to horror high is certainly no great shake,negative
note look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film,negative
and strangely enough he is the first character to get the ax literally,negative
to sum the entire film 54 up in one sentence it would be watch a vh1 documentary instead,negative
54 seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 brought him into studio 54 got him really drunk told him to write about it and then dumbed that down to be released to the public,negative
a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex drugs and disco,negative
the narrator shane oshae ryan phillippe works as a grease monkey in new jersey who of course on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio 54,negative
phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young attractive actor with a six pack stomach,negative
he is let in by steve rubbell mike myers the infamous coowner of studio 54 because he is attractive,negative
he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender,negative
you expected more didnt you,negative
there isnt,negative
the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as its climax isnt that an apt word for studio 54 lands with a thud,negative
the glitz of the club and perpetually semiclothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the its glamour,negative
for much of its target audience college age to early thirties it attempts to show celebrities mixing with normal people,negative
this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote,negative
you can be sure that half of the audience hasnt heard of them another quarter only know their names and the other quarter knew they were there already,negative
the humor if you can call it that is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then,negative
the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high sexually ambivlaent very new york steve rubell,negative
he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive,negative
he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued almost nostalgic performance when needed,negative
it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on coffee talk sans dress and wig,negative
the supporting cast of salma hayek breckin meyer and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere,negative
the romance between phillippe and cambell as a soap opera star is completely implausable,negative
the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes,negative
hayeks wannabe singer seems extremely forced and her husband greg meyer stands in as shane oshaes surrogate best friend,negative
the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long,negative
overall 54 tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine,negative
the film never leads to anything has no obserable point and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people,negative
in truth that reminded me of the eighies,negative
confucius once said governing a nation is like cooking a small fish dont overdo it,negative
his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make,negative
granted mike judge writerdirector of the workplace satire office space isnt exactly an amateur his most infamous work the mtv series beavis and butthead was pure gold for its network,negative
but unfailingly judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground,negative
the iffiness in judges plot a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss is not in its appeal,negative
in fact based on the popularity of scott adams cartoon dilbert which will soon have its own television series a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood,negative
unfortunately the concept lends itself to skitlength sequences which would be more at home on the set of saturday night live rather than a fulllength feature,negative
the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space which feature almost all of the movies top content this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated,negative
other evidence of office spaces failure to work are its lack of good jokes,negative
the comedy is marginally funny at best but not enough to get a packed house of theatergoers to laugh out loud,negative
the material in the movie is onkey for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting and this could partially explain his work here,negative
however the movie is loaded with too many misfires including the token plot to allow for any excuse,negative
the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers headed up by peter gibbons ron livingston at a company named initech,negative
after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech the movie introduces us to two consultants john c mcginley and paul willson which are in charge of downsizing the companys payroll,negative
when peter and his gang learns of this as well as the reason behind it so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh gary cole s stock will go up they set about creating a plan to see his downfall,negative
the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but,negative
a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer anistonasloveinterest subplot are all that keep this one together but its definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent,negative
lake placid marks yet another entry in the series of predator pics that were a screen staple in the late 1970s post jaws and were revived recently by the godawful anaconda,negative
placid claims to be a its directed by the same guy who did house but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of anaconda,negative
paleontologist kelly scott bridget fonda is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake,negative
discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile which shouldnt even be in this hemisphere kelly goes crochunting with game warden jack wells bill pullman and sheriff hank keough brendan gleeson,negative
theyre joined by an unwelcome guest hector cyr oliver platt a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them,negative
along the way the merry band meets mrs delores bickerman betty white a weird old lady who lives out on the lake,negative
you know what to expect from this movie lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator croc cam swimming toward someones dangling legs while jaws like music plays one character hector whos obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest another character who insists that the predator cant possibly exist,negative
unlike its slippery cousin anaconda lake placid wants to present its formulaic plot tongueincheek which is selfdefeating,negative
the result is neither scary nor funny its just tedious,negative
while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume including two installments of friday the 13th and halloween h20 screenwriter david kelley best known as the creator of tv series like ally mcbeal and chicago hope doesnt seem to have the stomach for a chomp em up flick,negative
the body count is surprisingly low and doesnt include any of the major characters and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it,negative
lake placid manages to have it both waysill let you discover how for yourself,negative
the croc itself is mostly computergenerated of course,negative
like the snake in anaconda the thirtyfoot monster crocodile doesnt seem real it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural,negative
lake placid also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine,negative
there is a lot of semimystical mumbo jumbo about how we really dont know much about crocodiles,negative
they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers,negative
a movie like this doesnt have to offer much of an explanation radioactive mutant,negative
creature from outer space but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on,negative
pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on autopilot,negative
most of the time theyre probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers,negative
platt and white on the other hand seem to be giving their best efforts and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script,negative
plot based on the wildly popular jerry springer tv show this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program,negative
one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the i slept with my stepfather segment and the other is based on some flygirl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted dog boyfriend,negative
critique the truth is that if i didnt have a day job i would probably watch the real jerry springer show every day,negative
i find it quite entertaining despite its complete lack of redeeming value,negative
having said that the show itself is outrageous funny and always filled with goofy surprises as opposed to this film which features no laughs is this a comedy or a drama uninteresting and completely unbelievable onedimensional stereotypes and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way,negative
i never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer but this film is an absolute yawnfest despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs lesbians ta and tv violence who wouldve guessed that,negative
i wish they would have either a made this movie much much funnier or b turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment,negative
unfortunately it doesnt seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real jerry springer reruns to complete his script leaving us with a boring film featuring no laughs onedimensional characters and no fun whatsoever,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati ohio,negative
for this film he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film burn hollywood burn,negative
drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside the one whos the awkward klutz or the spunky doityourselfer the one who just doesnt fit in with the others,negative
she has perfected these characters in movies such as the wedding singer and most notably ever after,negative
now shes back starring in what could be called a modernday cinderella fable never been kissed,negative
you know its a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary,negative
trust me on this one no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg and i dont mean steve invented the printing press,negative
the premise is simple,negative
barrymores josie geller at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago suntimes is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what todays teens are feeling and doing,negative
josie she says she was named after the 70s cartoon character was a geek in high school so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance,negative
this time she thinks she will get it right and be accepted by the incrowd,negative
now what kind of adult with a good job and a successful career would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was and is high school and adolescence,negative
these are among the many problems that plague never been kissed,negative
screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie,negative
their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy blubbering womanchild at the least provocation,negative
and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high schools most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability,negative
ok so never been kissed is not a sociological expose of todays high school scene,negative
however certain rules should apply to film and one of those is consistency of character,negative
among the movies problems is the illconceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and in the process lose focus on her assignment,negative
any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say get me rewrite,negative
to be fair barrymore is very appealing but she is given very little to work with,negative
she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character but the script continually undermines her,negative
barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk talk and act like a cool hip high schooler,negative
otherwise she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teenage stereotypes and situations,negative
never been kissed is entertaining and funny in fits and starts,negative
it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish,negative
the movies main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys the outsider who befriends new student josie,negative
josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls,negative
real mature,negative
and that is the main deficiency with never been kissed,negative
its illogical unrealistic uneven and undemanding,negative
it has some warm and humorous spots but not enough to overcome its many obstacles,negative
the cometdisaster flick is a disaster alright,negative
directed by tony scott top gun it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth,negative
and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble,negative
jeez,negative
after a great opening in which an american spaceship plus the city of new york are completely destroyed by a comet shower nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy,negative
they hire the worlds best oil driller bruce willis and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem,negative
thats like sending a mouse into a cat carrier isnt it,negative
the action in armageddon are so over the top nonstop and too ludicrous for words i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times,negative
i was not alone,negative
plus to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actors talents,negative
the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots,negative
the only real reason for making this film was to somehow outperform deep impact,negative
producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon,negative
after the recent animated debacles of a rugrats movie and a bugs life i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks other insect film from october antz,negative
i hated that movie and yet it is so much better than these latest two excursions,negative
a bugs life is the second animated insect film in the last two months and i hoped for the best considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixars last film 1995s toy story but in no way does a bugs life even remotely match up to that,negative
flik david foley an ant who along with his many comrades has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey,negative
flik however feels all alone and unwanted in the world especially after he accidentally loses all of their food and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other seasons load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees,negative
banished from ant island flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out but through a misunderstanding returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs including a walking stick david hyde pierce a dung beetle brad garrett a gypsy moth madeline kahn a male ladybug denis leary and a caterpillar joe ranft,negative
a bugs life has one thing going for it,negative
only one thing,negative
with its glorious bright colors the computergenerated animation is a spectacle to look at,negative
the film itself unfortunately is a lifeless unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of toy story,negative
the characters in a bugs life are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny oneliners,negative
the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as timefiller,negative
after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them but then i realized this is just not so,negative
i still adore almost all of the older disney films and many of the newer ones such as 1989s the little mermaid 1991s beauty and the beast 1993s the nightmare before christmas and yes 1995s toy story,negative
maybe this has just been a bad year for childrens films and hopefully the upcoming the prince of egypt will not be a disappointment,negative
as for a bugs life i did not enjoy anything about it,negative
not the story not the characters and not even the voiceover work which was far more lively in antz,negative
a bugs life goes down as yet another failure for disney and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture ill be home for christmas,negative
phil radmar jao has a hairy problem,negative
his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour,negative
he recently met the author of a nonfiction book on lycanthropy also referred to in the movie as werewolfism and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf,negative
using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him,negative
and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs,negative
made on a pittance the film features an almost exclusively asianamerican cast,negative
as directed by quentin lee and justin lin the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films,negative
jeanne chin plays katherine a meek and softspoken wife who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex,negative
we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins real and imagined to her therapist,negative
as her husband jim clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness,negative
the picture is filled with stereotypes,negative
theres a mysterious loudmouthed waitress with a big platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that shes a lesbian,negative
she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer a gay guy,negative
and the lone white with a major role the author on werewolfism has wildly unkempt orangey blonde curly hair,negative
from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist the script rarely has anything to offer,negative
the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were adlibbing,negative
one can only hope that the directors next film will have some substance and some credible acting,negative
shopping for fangs runs 1 30,negative
it is rated r for sex violence and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers,negative

screenplay gerald di pego from the novel by nicholas sparks,negative
cast kevin costner robin wrightpenn paul newman illeana douglas robbie coltrane jesse james john savage,negative
review by geoff berkshire,negative
im not an overly cynical guy,negative
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years,negative
however i have my limits and i also have standards,negative
this brings us to the subject at hand message in a bottle the big ticket romance that warner brothers unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentines day,negative
the story what little of it that there is involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne robin wrightpenn dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason jesse james,negative
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean,negative
the letter written to a mystery woman named catherine instantly captivates her,negative
upon her return theresa shares it with her best friend lina illeana douglas her boss charlie robbie coltrane and the entire city of chicago the newspaper publishes an article about it,negative
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake kevin costner and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down,negative
he turns out to have a colorful father paul newman but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing,negative
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship,negative
of course she doesnt tell him that she found his letter she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later preferably right after they first make love,negative
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened,negative
the discovery of the message and garrets discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film,negative
theres a truly lame subplot about garrets relationship with his dead wifes family he gets into a bar fight with her brother played by john savage and then the necessary tearjerking ending,negative
a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel,negative
the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced and unintentionally humorous sequences filmed since,negative
well since costners the postman 1997,negative
message in a bottle is one slow moving film,negative
last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this,negative
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work,negative
message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but theyre fighting the material all the way and losing badly,negative
costner and especially wrightpenn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring,negative
they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry,negative
the supporting players are given very little to do,negative
the reliable douglas is particularly wasted,negative
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film,negative
a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played,negative
however too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are,negative
the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story,negative
gabriel yared who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient 1996 and city of angels 1998 with his scores overdoes it a bit here,negative
caleb deschanels camera makes everything look a little too beautiful,negative
do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly,negative
the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times,negative
the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego,negative
working from a best selling novel by nicholas sparks which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times,negative
its strict adherence to clich s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer 1998,negative
there simply isnt an original scene in this film,negative
the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking,negative
this is director mandokis first film since when a man loves a woman 1994 the solid meg garcia romance,negative
hes simply going through the motions with this,negative
message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come 1998 as one of the most misguided romances of the decade,negative
woody allen is one of the most successful artistdirectors in hollywood but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker,negative
in his early years of filmmaking he mastered the simple comedy,negative
from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles,negative
some of these work better than others,negative
zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist,negative
deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back,negative
harry block allen has in his life only two drives,negative
he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing,negative
the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments,negative
perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harrys life by editing harrys scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out,negative
as a writer harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises,negative
the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harrys books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harrys life,negative
these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters,negative
it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person,negative
if that sounds complicated it is,negative
then as another device in one of the stories an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image,negative
harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time,negative
as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion the story is told out of chronological order,negative
if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable,negative
but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand,negative
deconstructing harry is set at a time when harrys old college the one that expelled him when he attended it wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement,negative
harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him,negative
just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear,negative
harry tries his current girl friend fay elizabeth shue only to find that she is about to marry harrys old friend larry billy crystal,negative
block would like his son hilly eric lloyd to accompany him but hillys mother previously first harrys psychiatrist and more recently his wife refuses to let her son see his father,negative
another friend richard bob balaban would go but has health problems,negative
harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie hazel goodman,negative
it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite but cookie is considerably differentblack and a lot brighter than mira sorvinos character in the previous film,negative
while the comedy sequences are never complete a few are elaborate and some quite funny,negative
the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil who looks a lot like larry,negative
that story also is left uncompleted perhaps to show harrys unwillingness to commit even to telling a story,negative
the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care,negative
that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes,negative
allen can do much better than deconstructing harry,negative
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom by way of the everglades to defend a young educated black man blair underwood,negative
the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl and says that his confession was coerced from the regions tough black cop lawrence fishburne,negative
watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough but the plots a joke,negative
theres no logic at work here,negative
tone is also an issuethere is none,negative
director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say,negative
is it a statement on human rights,negative
is it a knockoff of silence of the lambs,negative
glimcher never tells,negative
instead he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop over drawbridge after drawbridge hoping that the audience wont notice whats missing,negative
just awful,negative
the madness of king george 107 min,negative
not rated,negative
still wondering who nigel hawthorne is,negative
then check out his oscar nominated work in the madness of king george still playing in both raleigh and chapel hill,negative
stage director nicholas hytner in a remarkable screen debut has adapted alan bennetts 1991 tragic comedy to fine effect,negative
sumptuouslooking and only mildly stuffy the film charts the madness that plagued king george iii hawthorne almost 30 years into his reign,negative
a man of no importance 98 min,negative
rated r,negative
in suri krishnammas a man of no importance albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that its a shame when the film gets so serious around him,negative
his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde,negative
he reads to his riders and once a year with their help he tries to stage one of the authors plays,negative
this year its salome,negative
for about an hour theres a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of workingclass stiffs,negative
conflict arises but its small stuffan administrator from the bus company here an outraged catholic pork butcher michael gambon there,negative
but with finney at the wheel so to speak the film rolls smoothly over these plot pointsjust like the gorgeous leland doubledecker bus in the story,negative
where things get serious is toward the end of the film when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride,negative
the twist makes senseand helps paint a complete picture of finneys characterbut the trip to get there betrays the light airy atmosphere of what had come before,negative
its not a fatal misstep mind you and it doesnt send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity,negative
its just a turn off,negative
dr strangelove 93 min,negative
not rated,negative
mein fuhrer,negative
the most fun that i had last month was in durham at the carolina at a midweek screening of stanley kubricks pitchblack comedy dr,negative
strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,negative
the 1964 film stars peter sellers in three roles george c scott sterling hayden and slim pickens,negative
their antics brought the house down which to my surprise was packed by an audience younger than the film,negative
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad,negative
so i didnt expect too much from this,negative
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre,negative
i thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont,negative
i thought mabe it will be fun,negative
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing,negative
but by the end of it i thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont,negative
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality,negative
here is the story in the monstrously overdecorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation,negative
among them is a sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones a cynical dope owen wilson and a gentle and emotional lady lily taylor,negative
actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens,negative
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself,negative
it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights,negative
portals become veiny stainedglass eyeballs,negative
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth,negative
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains,negative
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen,negative
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture,negative
is that exciting or what,negative
the worst thing about it is that it didnt have to be bad,negative
its based on a great book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson,negative
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent,negative
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience,negative
the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses,negative
and with a 70 mill,negative
budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror,negative
de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening,negative
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush,negative
but why give him a more serious material,negative
in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bonts career as a director,negative
yet it wouldnt be fair to say that everything is bad,negative
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky,negative
but this is where the good things end,negative
the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life,negative
its nothing more than a special effectsextravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesnt engage,negative
at first you do not know whats going on,negative
is this part of the experiment,negative
are these hallucinations,negative
projections of the subconscience,negative
paranoia,negative
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening,negative
the house is actually possessed,negative
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window,negative
for ever i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and thats what i got,negative
i believe hichock once said that its better to wait for a climax than to see one,negative
this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid,negative
they are impossible to take seriously,negative
any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubricks the shining are absolutely baseless,negative
shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality,negative
haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of,negative
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film,negative
casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse,negative
but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid,negative
midway through anaconda documentary filmmaker terri flores jennifer lopez turns to a coworker and says i thought this movie would be my first big break,negative
instead its turned into a disaster,negative
truer words have never been spoken,negative
anaconda is a monster movie with a lousy monster,negative
its a suspense film that is utterly predictable,negative
its a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares but only in the most elementary way like a jackinthebox,negative
as you turn the crank youre totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up but somehow its still mildly startling when it happens,negative
the main difference between the giant snake in anaconda and the clown in a jackinthebox is that the clown is more realistic,negative
anaconda boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years,negative
animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe inducing robots youve endured at disney world,negative
but its the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame,negative
in one shot a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air,negative
the scene if done well would have been a jaw dropper,negative
here the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon,negative
whats really amazing is that the filmmakers were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie,negative
but enough about the phony snakes,negative
now its time to talk about the lousy story,negative
heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest,negative
stoltz tells his crew pray that you didnt forget your bug spray,negative
apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect,negative
along the way the group rescues a whackedout lapsed priest jon voight who claims to know how to find the shirishama,negative
within minutes they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness,negative
from that point on the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from jaws and dead calm,negative
one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz,negative
early in the story his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious,negative
so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance,negative
also why did stoltz who generally selects his roles with great care agree to appear in this crap,negative
ah the mysteries of hollywood,negative
the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen,negative
jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters,negative
lopez who starred in selena is an enormously appealing performer possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible,negative
ice cube has a special charisma an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously,negative
theres also a special twinkle in his eyes as if hes gently mocking his own toughguy posturing,negative
but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight,negative
obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas voight plays the villain in thick accent with a series of leers and hisses spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of jonny quest,negative
at one point he looms over the crew and says the anaconda is the perfect killing machine,negative
it strikes wraps around you holds you tighter than your true love,negative
and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode,negative
that moment is so highcamp that it almost made the film tolerable,negative
almost,negative
fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out anaconda,negative
dont,negative
there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer including another alien sequel,negative
wait for them rent jaws in the meantime and dont throw away your money and time on drivel like this,negative
the sequel to the fugitive 1993 u s marshals is an average thriller using its association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks,negative
tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive,negative
this time hes after fugitive mark sheridan snipes who the police think killed two fbi agents but of course hes been set up and when the police plane escort he and gerard are riding crashes he makes a run for it gerard not so hot on his tail,negative
what follows is about 2 hours of action brought to us by the director of executive decision 1995 another film curiously involving a plane,negative
when comparing this movie to the fugitive the prequel is far superior,negative
but even on its own u s marshals is a pretty lousy movie,negative
while the original was reasonably intelligent and had a fugitive to root for the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time,negative
while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character u s marshals is straight in there pulling its trump card the place crash almost immediately,negative
to be honest i couldnt care less if snipes character got captured or not,negative
snipes performance is average and his character gets surprisingly little screen time considering he is the fugitive for reasons ill explain later,negative
tommy lee jones is as fine as ever although his role is hardly a challenge,negative
the sense of deja vu was overwhelming,negative
i know its the same role from the fugitive but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film,negative
theres a few nudge nudge references from the first film but apart from that nothing,negative
nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie,negative
downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce whos roped into the chase and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife,negative
nobody looks as if their having a good time and all the performers are on autopilot,negative
the supporting cast are o k but when it comes to performances u s marshals falls flat on its face,negative
it doesnt fare any better plotwise either,negative
the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes but then veers off into terrorists territory,negative
as said above the film is an normal average terrorist thriller seen a million times before but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional,negative
if this film wasnt the sequel to the fugitive this would probably go straight to video or not even been made at all because its so average,negative
and because of the films plot changing its course snipes is almost forgotten apart and hardly features in the movie,negative
stuart baird the director is all right but theres no particular scene that stands out,negative
its director is the usual action movie style,negative
even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension,negative
the special effects are nice especially the plane crash and theres a good if very loud soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith,negative
but in the end u s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement,negative
sure its loud and dumb but in the end u s marshals just aint fun,negative
bored performers and a lackluster plot and script do not make a good action movie,negative
overall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities,negative
all through its production and into the early days of its initial aborted prerelease publicity hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood,negative
ultimately however paramount pictures nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996s other underperforming disaster films dantes peak volcano changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year,negative
but to paraphrase the bard swill by any other name would smell as rank,negative
no number of name changes can help this picture,negative
its not just about a disaster it is a disaster,negative
hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute,negative
the best shot occurs during the opening credits as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg indiana as the water level slowly rises,negative
the community protected by an overworked dam is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloudchoked skies,negative
from that moment on its all downhill,negative
whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point,negative
it takes forever to get to the end credits this is one of the longestseeming 95minute motion pictures i have recently endured,negative
basically hard rain is one extended dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shootouts,negative
theres a lot of water broken glass gunfire and explosions,negative
its all very routine and uninteresting because there arent any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense,negative
the films conclusion is so preposterous that its almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around,negative
action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion,negative
graham yost the writer of both speed and hard rain surely understands that principle,negative
unfortunately neither he nor cinematographerturneddirector mikael salomon a far off place applies it,negative
the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition,negative
we see the same kinds of things speedboat chases flood damage shootouts etc over and over again,negative
the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length,negative
the storyline gives us a number of paperthin characters in contrived circumstances,negative
theres tom christian slater the one dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash,negative
he and his partner charlie edward asner tvs lou grant get stuck on a street thats rapidly turning into a river,negative
a group of men led by jimmy morgan freeman arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers,negative
after charlie is killed in a shootout tom hides the money then runs,negative
as he swims and boats his way through huntingburgs roads he encounters some of the locals karen minnie driver a wouldbe love interest a bickering old couple richard dysart and betty white who are on hand to provide comic relief and the easilycorrupted sheriff randy quaid whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives,negative
there isnt any real acting in this film,negative
christian slater utters a few lame oneliners and does a lot of mugging for the camera,negative
tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen,negative
randy quaid sneers a lot and is totally unconvincing,negative
morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances but they are defeated by the script,negative
freeman one of the best cinematic thespians working today looks suitably embarrassed to be here but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from timetotime,negative
following in the wake of twister this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesnt trust natures fury as the chief engine of conflict,negative
as a result we are saddled with an idiotic good guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had,negative
titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water,negative
hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible,negative
thus far this year hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire firestorm and water hard rain,negative
fortunately there are only two elements left,negative
an 18foothigh 43footlong dragon is the computergenerated co star of this strictlybythenumbers sword n sorcery flick,negative
as voiced by sean connery draco is a surprisingly expressive creation who is welldeserving of his 23 minutes of screen time,negative
he walks talks flies fries and even fakes his own death all with the help of 96 computeraided animators,negative
too bad that ilm industrial light and magic couldnt spare some special effects for dragonhearts human costars,negative
a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be,negative
hes a neartotal loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight,negative
david thewlis evil king has a high hiss factor hf though hes more of a mumbling oddity than anything else,negative
oh and theres some redhead in a 90s wig who runs around either screaming or scowling depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant,negative
the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions julie christie as the good queen mother a band of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavymetal concert and believe or it not the speaking spirit of king arthur,negative
bring out your dead,negative
unfortunately when we add it all together draco fringe bits quaid thewlis the sum total amounts to zero,negative
dragonheart is well too much of too little,negative
director rob cohen dragon the bruce lee story has made a big expensive movie that while ambitiously plotted is both murky and predictable,negative
and overscored,negative
and selfimportant,negative
and the list goes on,negative
i must ask did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that every character be stabbed lanced or sliced at least once,negative
keep that man away from the knife drawer,negative
the last five minutes of this movie are the worst with some silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any planetarium light show much less a summer movie,negative
save your money,negative
it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels you must suspend disbelief,negative
however there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies,negative
it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg indiana where the film is set does not have a mcdonalds a sears store a statue of a man on a horse nor even a dam close by,negative
even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel,negative
firstly morgan freeman possibly the greatest actor alive after such films as driving miss daisy the shawshank redemption and se7en was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement,negative
he should have played the town sheriff an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman,negative
as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases,negative
i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them and it seems a tad strange that an entire town with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way can vanish before the flood has actually started,negative
but nether the less armored guard couriers tom christian slater and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van,negative
with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road,negative
jim morgan freeman and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars,negative
but of course tom is more than willing to save the day so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town,negative
the local sheriff randy quaid whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 and a couple of police men investigate the situation but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what would do with their share of the three million dollars,negative
director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsyturvy and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience,negative
but by the time these interesting changes occur its far too late in the film for them to have much affect,negative
hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par,negative
not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected,negative
such titles as broken arrow slater and john travolta and nicholas cage and john travolta come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations,negative
strangely enough they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta,negative
we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character,negative
if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow my answer would have been a definite no,negative
i now know that he has no excuse and can do better if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store,negative
although hard rain never really works from the start i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen,negative
the addition of an enticing subplot would have given the film time to breathe rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else,negative
despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film,negative
no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about 8 50 is compare this to other films,negative
stephen please post if appropriate,negative
mafia crime isnt a funny business by homer yen c 1998,negative
on a particular night when i found myself having some free time i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see mafia a spoof of mafia and crime films such as the godfather goodfellas and casino,negative
at 84 minutes in length i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep,negative
but by my account i think that my laffometer only registered a few grins one giggle and maybe one chortle,negative
i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star lloyd bridges who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film,negative
mafia,negative
chronicles vincenzo cortinos lloyd bridges life,negative
separated from his family when he was young he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life,negative
but as fate would have it vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord,negative
following in his footsteps are his two sons joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr,negative
like all siblings in powerful crime families they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and women,negative
mafia is cowritten by jim abrahams who also contributed to some gutbusting funny spoofs such as airplane and the naked gun,negative
but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work,negative
as i write this i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based,negative
crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence,negative
its a tough genre to parody,negative
i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say please as they decide which sector to take over but this opportunity was never explored,negative
there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughterinlaw,negative
a gunman shoots him several times,negative
the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him from the samba to disco to the macarena,negative
i think that i just gave away the best part of the film,negative
oh well that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier,negative
the premise of the new james wong film final destination is that alex browning the protagonist prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane thereby cheating fate,negative
however fate is not so easily bested and alexs friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances,negative
essentially this premise is a cleverway to make a slasherflick without the slasher,negative
unfortunately this is practically the only clever thing about the film,negative
as far as teen horror flicks go final destination is better than many,negative
there is enough shocking death graphic gore and requisite black humor to provide the essential roller coaster type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick,negative
unfortunately this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre,negative
the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to setup the next death,negative
the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed,negative
if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date this film might do the trick,negative
other than that wait until it goes into heavyrotation on cable,negative
beware of movies with the directors name in the title,negative
take john carpenters ghosts of mars please,negative
if the carpenter brand name wasnt superglued to the title this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network,negative
and i would have been spared a headache,negative
the latest from the director of starman halloween and escape from new york is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a futuristic horror flick,negative
the production is set on mars in 2176 where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world,negative
six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the red planet terraforming to make it more hospitable for future generations,negative
a matriarchal society,negative
terraforming,negative
sounds pretty intriguing eh,negative
well dont get your hopes up,negative
that is unless youre one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters,negative
i can tell you one thing now they gave the entire movie away,negative
why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me,negative
however if they hadnt given it away the film wouldve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter,negative
obviously the producers thought they could remake the deep end of the ocean throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama,negative
double jeopardy offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones who got first billing even though he didnt see to be on screen half as much as judd did,negative
it also offers some genuinely funny clever or fulloftension moments my favorite judd waking up in the coffin but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot,negative
half the time im wondering whether im watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised,negative
judging by the beginning end and a huge chunk of the middle i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too,negative
the movies stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material,negative
implausible material no less,negative
loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside too many times in the movie i thought that is not possible,negative
that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies but not one like double jeopardy that tries to pass itself off as serious drama,negative
everything seems dragged out overplayed,negative
when they shouldve kept us in the dark they let the cat out of the bag too early,negative
its a good thing most animated scifi movies come from japan because titan a e is proof that hollywood doesnt have a clue how to do it,negative
i dont know what this film is supposed to be about,negative
from what i can tell its about a young man named kale whos one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and regenerating what is left of the human race,negative
thats a fine premise for an actionpacked scifi animated movie but theres no payoff,negative
the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil dredge aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason,negative
so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights and more doublecrosses than you can shake a stick at,negative
theres so much pointless scifi banter its too much to take,negative
the galaxy here is a total ripoff of the star wars universe the creators dont bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring,negative
despite the fantastic animation and special effects its just not an interesting movie,negative
bob the happy bastards quickie review,negative
the odd couple ii,negative
grumpy old men it aint,negative
hell my fellow americans it aint,negative
walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years,negative
odd couple ii feels terribly generic where in the first movie made thirty one years ago feels like a wonderful tale,negative
thats like repackaging campbells soup in a generic food can really,negative
how writer neil simon couldve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me,negative
throughout the movie i really didnt laugh once,negative
honestly,negative
i mean there were dumb situations yeah like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice but they just really didnt seem funny to me,negative
and that car rolling off the cliff,negative
the only way i wouldve seen humor in that is if they were still in it,negative
and the ending gets all supermushy too,negative
in the final twenty minutes or so lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one then loses her matthau talks to his son a wasted jonathan silverman about his amrriage to lemmons daughter and of course lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands,negative
ooh i really gave a lot away there im sure,negative
consider it a hospitable gester you wont waste your time renting this muck,negative
capsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smiths films gets their own movie,negative
the gags are sporadically funny,negative
it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and antigay jokes,negative
the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team,negative
the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film,negative
sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching,negative
this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night,negative
and it turns out he had very good reasons,negative
low 0 4 to 4,negative
a film needs a plot,negative
it needs characters for empathy value,negative
it needs a story and an emotional center,negative
if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are,negative
kevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy,negative
with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp,negative
peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled,negative
but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smiths fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it,negative
his remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience,negative
jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes film pastiches and injokes,negative
how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call,negative
for me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny,negative
there was not enough cleverness or variety,negative
it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay,negative
penis jokes work only so many times,negative
showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags,negative
they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british postwar films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico,negative
jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners,negative
as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts,negative
in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads,negative
jay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks,negative
this leaves them at loose ends,negative
they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie,negative
they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash,negative
so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way,negative
the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood,negative
the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny,negative
silent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his,negative
this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have,negative
jay has to be the comic,negative
he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive,negative
the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny,negative
he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair,negative
so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team,negative
their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen beforesometimes just minutes before,negative
like dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie,negative
certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving,negative
they are excuses for gags many of which still fall flat,negative
it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content,negative
the film does not offer much to an adult audience,negative
i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
starring kiefer sutherland reese witherspoon bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen,negative
freeway is giving me second thoughts,negative
freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood,negative
only in the nineties little red riding hood is a foulmouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon and the big bad wolf is a serial killer keifer sutherland,negative
to top that pathetic premise off reese goes to visit granny and youll never guess whos waiting under the covers in grannys bed,negative
keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented yet underrated actors and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star,negative
so what are they doing in this movie,negative
after seeing the end result undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question,negative
you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review,negative
the answer is quite simple i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary,negative
i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it,negative
note to keifer you wonder why you arent a bigger star in hollywood,negative
because you keep making movies like this,negative
note to reese you were great in fear what happened this time,negative
note to both dont worry about it too much no one saw this movie anyway,negative
bottom line im still shaking my head,negative
dont waste your time on this turkey,negative
if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie go rent flatliners or young guns,negative
reese witherspoons abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear a great thriller,negative
do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can,negative
in 1989 tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather,negative
was it deep,negative
nope,negative
however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up,negative
it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman pictures,negative
which was true,negative
if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic mans escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place,negative
if those films were tom sawyer then batman was huckleberry finn,negative
some critics glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it was something special mr lovell gave it 12 and wrote that this is batman as batman should be,negative
mr travers called it one of the ten best films of the year,negative
the praise was deserved from start to finish the film was enthralling exciting and superb in every respect,negative
there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton,negative
the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes,negative
the villains the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin to bite off batmans nose he simply gets mad and when we want catwoman to slither over batmans body she gets pushed off a building,negative
i admire mr burton for trying to do more then entertain but the result is a mess,negative
nothing works out as planned it fails both to entertain and to enlighten,negative
hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast,negative
alas these are only hints,negative
there are dont misunderstand me several moments of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped by the penguin within a giant cage a small basket is dropped into a large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis,negative
a weak followup both career and sequel wise batman returns is sometimes dazzling but to often dissapointing,negative
a fullyloaded entertainment review website coming soon,negative
hunter s thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas written in 1971 is already an american classic not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the postpsychedelia of the 1960s but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as gonzo,negative
soon after the book was written hunter s thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke,negative
and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas the movie,negative
although the book is one of my favorites i now agree with thompsons own assessment of the novel as unfilmable,negative
the main problem is that the book although detailing wild drug use and trippedout adventures was not written on the road,negative
it was written and edited by hunter s thomspons relatively sober at his home,negative
so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor,negative
hunter s thomspon the narrator while always drugged out still has a grip on reality and can still tell with journalistic ability what is going on around him,negative
not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas,negative
despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped the movie is an exact duplicate of the book in terms of dialouge,negative
unfortunately this can get annoying in the form of johnny depps who plays thompson excessive narration,negative
and the characters while having vivid personalities are played as 2d characers on the screen dr raoul duke johnny depp the name raoul duke was an alias of thompsons and his riding companion dr gonzo benicio del toro who is a large samoan lawyer have no personalities or emotions at all save for stoned,negative
the film is very faithful to the plot what there is of the book in that dr raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs,negative
from there one set of stoned adventures after another happens including one of the few good scenes in which depp high on acid watches all the people in the bar around him turn into literally lounge lizards,negative
while the movie has its moments few it is almost unwatchable at parts especially towards the end,negative
despite a lot of celebrity cameos the stars never get off the ground,negative
the set decoration and costumes are great and probably deserve an oscar nomination,negative
however as we all know its not sets or effects that make a movie its the characters and quite frankly these characters are no good,negative
sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things and pushing tin certainly features some name stars who are going places billy bob thornton cate blanchett angelina jolie and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first but hes actually the veteran among this quartet of finelooking people,negative
sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has hip comedy written all over it compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits compensate for clich d characterizations compensate for embarrassing you have to be joking situations,negative
etc,negative
in pushing tin thornton blanchett jolie and cusack dont have an earthly,negative
from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble squiggly quirky credits fakelooking passenger planes circling new york and anne dudleys inyourear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for the full monty let alone won it,negative
but i for one wasnt ready to walk just yet,negative
so quickly we descend into a tightlyedited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job yes what with their frantic mileaminute instructional personas juggling planes and passengers lives like some huge real midair video game,negative
hip cool demonic auctioneer nick the zone falzone cusack is the best in the biz,negative
of course,negative
until some hipper cooler leatherclad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell thornton shows up to challenge falzones finite air space,negative
boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding then the macho oneupmanship begins,negative
it doesnt stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cats whisker of each other,negative
oh no,negative
there are some broken hoop dreams some wannaseehowfasticandrives and then the ultimate showdown was that my wife i saw you with last night,negative
director mike newell four weddings and a funeral must have read a different draft of this script because the one thats being acted out up there between newark jfk and la guardia doesnt have an ounce of subtlety and newell has made some awfully goodand funnymovies before,negative
the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe,negative
theyll make you frown in disbelief,negative
theyll have you constantly looking at your watch,negative
but wait,negative
theres still 100 minutes to go,negative
the films only saving grace is blanchett whose connie falzone is a spunky brash long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes,negative
this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a redheaded australian gambler oscar and lucinda and a tempestuous british monarch elizabeth,negative
but shes not enough to save the picture,negative
thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke,negative
jolie as russells knock em dead wife isnt bad but the upandcoming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything,negative
cusack cracks gum dons shades and acts hip throughout but like everything else in the film his performance is forced,negative
in the last ten minutes or so for some inexplicable reason things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been like the trailer teases,negative
but its too little too late,negative
a fine cast aside pushing tin is nothing more than an embarrassment,negative
written by alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni,negative
directed by terry gilliam,negative
ive always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid,negative
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last,negative
then theres the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychninelaced dose,negative
mushrooms on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel a steady reassuring assent a short period of thrilling motion and color and then a smooth landing,negative
acid is for daredevils mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy,negative
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas director terry gilliam has made an acid movie when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie,negative
full of shocking sight gags aggressive images and grotesque comic performances the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s thompsons book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological worldview from the inside out,negative
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a wellmade film gilliam has produced a mixed bag,negative
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how selfprofessed gonzo journalist hunter s thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorneys convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971,negative
operating under the pseudonyms of raoul duke and dr,negative
gonzo the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and a rainbow of multicolored uppers and downers,negative
they terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them,negative
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge,negative
dr gonzo becomes enamored of a thickbladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplanes white rabbit reaches its climax,negative
and these guys dont just trash hotel rooms they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead,negative
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view,negative
thompsons book besides being a hilarious read has stood the test of time as an important historical document,negative
it simultaneously exposed the 60s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die,negative
pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompsons message but the truth is that stripped to its bare essentials what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy,negative
its a cheech and chong movie,negative
youre there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall down,negative
theres nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam tries too hard,negative
this is a frantic movie all sweaty closeups wideangle lenses dutch tilts and otherworldly lighting schemes,negative
there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen,negative
but to what end,negative
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompsons book and there are some priceless comic observations,negative
but youre hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work,negative
this brings us to the performances which strike me as all wrong,negative
depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c scott in patton a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompsons dialogue,negative
in between his several puking scenes del toro fares better as dr gonzo but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost,negative
watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads now that would have been something to see,negative
its interesting to note that alex cox credited as a cowriter on the screenplay was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over,negative
as much of a fan as i am of gilliams work cox would have been the better choice,negative
sid and nancy coxs best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film,negative
gilliam commits the compound sin of overdirecting his film while being uncertain of his purpose,negative
what kind of movie was he trying to make anyway,negative
it doesnt try to be a cautionary tale and it doesnt work as broad comedy,negative
if he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been a much more interesting film,negative
but i dont want to be too hard on it,negative
there are some truly funny moments and if youre in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it,negative
i do however recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance i guarantee it will enhance the effect,negative
movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past,negative
so undoubtedly one day someone said evolution,negative
its ghostbusters plus men in black plus tremors,negative
and so it is,negative
sum total none,negative
the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon arizona,negative
community college science profs ira kane david duchovny and harry block orlando jones take some samples from the meteor and discover that onecelled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth,negative
just about the time i was wondering hey doesnt the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies the government came in and took over the whole area,negative
the leader of the pack gen woodman ted levine turns out to be an old nemesis of iras and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research,negative
meanwhile the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people,negative
by this time ira and harry have gained a friend in dr allison reed julianne moore of the center for disease control,negative
a country club poolboy wayne green seann william scott has also attached himself to the merry band,negative
but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time,negative
director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit 1984s ghostbusters but evolution falls miserably short,negative
one reason is readily apparent,negative
ghostbusters had three really funny guys as its scientists bill murray dan aykroyd and harold ramis but evolution has one really funny guy orlando jones who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone elses hands,negative
for good measure ghostbusters had the comic talents of rick moranis evolution offers seann william scott who was much funnier in american pie and road trip than he is here,negative
scott has one amusing scene where he sings you are so beautiful to me to a dragonlike alien to draw it into a trap,negative
other than that scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him,negative
an actor in search of a forte david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in playing god and his romantic side in return to me,negative
now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent what we all find is that he doesnt have any,negative
look for him to be back on tv in five years or so,negative
another sad case is julianne moore who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts,negative
shes a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy,negative
her character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs,negative
the sole saving grace of the film is jones,negative
hes at the center of the movies funniest scene where an alien bug invades harrys body and has to be pulled out through his ass,negative
jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it but he cant carry the whole movie by himself,negative
he found himself in a similar situation in the replacements where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast,negative
jones will eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star but this isnt it,negative
as any reasonable human being would i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things,negative
i am befuddled by fight club,negative
now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later,negative
perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time,negative
perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them,negative
fight club is either garbage or brilliant but at least right now i must lean toward the former,negative
maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold,negative
but if it is i sure don t see it,negative
edward norton plays jack a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer,negative
his insomnia coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to complete himself make him a loser at the game of life,negative
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window he seeks comfort in a stranger tyler pitt whom he met on a flight home,negative
once jack is sucked into tyler s world he can t get out literally,negative
they begin fight club an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging,negative
as the fight club grows things get out of control and take on cult status beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler s house for three days,negative
i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film since that contains the twist that explains the pointless journey,negative
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher who s previous two films se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation,negative
this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table,negative
but with fight club he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and selfreferencing film elements such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good flashback humor,negative
now throughout the film s coarsely woven texture and overextended plot lines fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today,negative
advertisements interoffice politics corporations you name it it s addressed,negative
though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced,negative
all of them play an important role,negative
how so,negative
well i can kinda just tell,negative
i can t really put my finger on it,negative
to say that starbucks and barnes noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news,negative
is that bad for the world,negative
probably,negative
not much room for social commentary there,negative
we all know that interoffice politics are just that politics,negative
so what was the point of all this,negative
the film seems desperate to make a point or a number of points but i couldn t figure out what they were,negative
all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques a bleak visual design and some fine acting,negative
pitt carter norton all of them are good,negative
even meatloaf is good,negative
when you get to the end you will most likely be filled with questions many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself,negative
not them because each of them would likely give you a different answer,negative
fight club means what you want it to mean i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about,negative
but it couldn t be more bizarre and unappealing,negative
sure it had shock value but so did se7en and the game and they were significantly stronger films,negative
the original babe was my favorite movie of 1995 a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience,negative
being a surprise commercial and critical success it had no marketing tieins which limited its final take,negative
thus babe 2 arrives with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1,negative
plush dolls vending machines hawking tshirts and macys thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday moneygrubbing,negative
too late,negative
this is a sad review to write because babe 2 not only does not live up to the original but it doesnt even come to a fraction of it,negative
i shouldnt expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic but this film tries too hard and loses its charm,negative
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity unaware that his car is in neutral,negative
imagine with me if you will screams jamie kennedy explaining the rules for sequels like babe 2,negative
1 there must be more talking animals,negative
2 there must be more slapstick comedy,negative
3 there must be more songs for those mice to sing thats cute,negative
4 keep the story cards to break up the action thats cute too even though the pig gets wise made no sense given the context of that story partition,negative
5 there must be action however illogical that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to the baaramewe secret code the thatll do pig,negative
thatll do,negative
now throw in the limitations a james cromwell now a hot commodity has limited time on the set or maybe he didnt approve of the script,negative
b christine cavanaugh the voice of the original babe demands more money 200 000paltry considering the 80 million budget,negative
out,negative
e g,negative
daily comes in with noticable results,negative
c george miller the director is more wellknown for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment not for kiddie fare and no he didnt direct that andre film in 94,negative
d the special effects are impressive but limited,negative
babe talks but most of the time from a single shot repeated over and over again,negative
babe is center screen looking straight into the camera with a happy smirkregardless of whether hes happy or scared or tired,negative
season now with the original elements which as we will find out are straight from the screenwritingishell bin,negative
i change the venue into the big city,negative
this has been praised as wildly original,negative
excuse me didnt home alone do this several years ago,negative
how about the muppets,negative
even the bad news bears travelled to tokyo,negative
sorry,negative
no dice,negative
side note to give the city a fairytale look george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the worlds great cities and yes it is impressive,negative
but this too is overused repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions,negative
and for the most part babe remains in the hotel,negative
ii given the limitations of cromwell the human element is taken over by the boss wife played by magda szubanski,negative
stretch,negative
shes not a lead actresstype shes not funny enough in her physical comedy and shes simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls,negative
have her arrested falsely on drug charges,negative
have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes,negative
have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner,negative
i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in,negative
i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film the violence the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge head submerged underwater,negative
even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it as the brothers grimm have demonstrated,negative
no my problem is with the story or lack thereof,negative
babe is sent out to save the hoggett farm but once in the city that story is forgotten,negative
being a goodnatured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice but other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull what did babe actually do,negative
without giving the ending away the farm is saved from a leftfield quirk that had nothing to do with the pig,negative
speaking of pig or pigpigpigpigpig,negative
the word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino i could have been watching scarface,negative
this is screenwriting,negative
further i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups,negative
had it been a cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened,negative
but to farmer hoggett,negative
his wife,negative
an elderly mickey rooney,negative
much too irreverent,negative
quick,negative
splice those singing mice into those scenes,negative
the film isnt a colossal failure,negative
i did like glenne headleys schmoozy chimpanzee,negative
i liked the pink poodle,negative
the dog on the cart who momentarily thinks hes in dog heaven,negative
and a weird looking guy who may have been doublycast as an airport employee and a judge,negative
but most of the time i was looking down in boredom or in embarrassment over the hackedup script,negative
them singing mice those chapter partitions the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for a story,negative
let me spoil the final scene farmer hoggett looks at pig proud says thatll do pig,negative
thatll do,negative
thats it,negative
hope i didnt ruin it for you,negative
but tell me this what the heck did that pig do,negative
ahh yes,negative
the teenage romance,negative
an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies and in the end the guy always gets the girl,negative
and with the arrival of the breakout hit shes all that last year followed by a long catalogue of imitators including 10 things i hate about you and drive me crazy the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity,negative
along now comes down to you,negative
the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid shes all that craze with their latest project which has the studdly freddie prinze jr attached and all,negative
only down to you doesnt have the unlikely scenario mentioned above,negative
it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance a dull unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that were accustomed to,negative
this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12year old girls will find convincing,negative
in strictly textbook fashion college sophomore and aspiring chef al prinze jr meets freshman artist imogen julia stiles,negative
they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies,negative
from here its the standard boymeetsgirl boylosesgirl boydrinksentirebottleofshampooandmayormaynotgetgirlback story,negative
the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters who are frequently taking part in activities that,negative
well only happen in the movies,negative
fortunately the cast of down to you has a certain appeal,negative
freddie prinze jr and julia stiles are an adorable couple and when on screen together they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around,negative
zak orth as the newly realized porn star monk shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the films intelligent dialogue,negative
rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy the faculty selma blair cruel intentions and ashton kutcher tvs that 70s shows,negative
even the fonz himself henry winkler the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia has a welcome role as als dad the host of the popular cooking program chef ray,negative
maybe the concept of down to you looked good on paper to draw such a crowd,negative
as a feature film however the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely,negative
perhaps worst of all down to you is not funny,negative
the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired,negative
the characters on screen often laughing at each others antics seemed far more amused than the audience,negative
even the giggly 12year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run its course,negative
the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr in a fantasy sequence called cooks a cops takeoff in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for needy families with the assistance of a fullyarmed swat team of course,negative
when this is the highlight reel you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired,negative
in order to make a teen comedy work youve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity,negative
10 things i hate about you actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards and the result was refreshing,negative
no such luck with down to you,negative
its just a textbook romance where despite absurd circumstances everything is bound to work out in the end,negative
and at the end of the whole clich d ordeal the nicest thing you could possibly say would be,negative
only in the movies,negative
the generals daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film well see this year or perhaps the stupidest clever film,negative
its confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction,negative
that however is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller,negative
the punchedup punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the generals daughter has a brain in its head even as the remaining 75 of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense,negative
our hero is warrant officer paul brenner a brash investigator for the u s armys criminal investigation division,negative
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson at a georgia base the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation,negative
complicating the case is the fact that capt campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell a war hero and potential vicepresidential nominee,negative
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in,negative
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe who coincidentally enough once had a romantic relationship with brenner brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captains past that make the case ever more sordid,negative
if only the sordidness were the worst of the generals daughters problems,negative
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filteredlight sleaze,negative
director simon west likely thinks hes covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches which is the films fatal flaw,negative
its a trend he continues for two hours taking the storys few virtues and slapping a coat of moronproof obviousness over them,negative
characters who may wink wink turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow cutaway inserts of the captain campbells stillliving face after the corpse is uncovered insure against fiveminute attention spans,negative
west just cant help himself from overdirecting every minute of the generals daughter,negative
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slowfade edits,negative
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell,negative
the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbells mentor a psychological warfare expert named moore james woods,negative
theres something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another,negative
indeed travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures to the local sheriff of the georgia county shouldnt you be out nightsticking the colored folk,negative
even the lame device of brenner and sunhills sexual history provides a few winning zingers,negative
goldmans dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than youll find in most socalled comedies,negative
dialogue unfortunately just isnt enough to make a quality script,negative
its difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene and too lucky for it to last any longer not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye,negative
by the time the generals daughter wanders towards its overwrought psychointherain finale wests heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun,negative
its silly and pretentious filmmaking but at least it provides a giggle or five,negative
goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a standup routine,negative
well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task,negative
he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films,negative
in a domain that he owns it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one,negative
eraser back in 1996 was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense,negative
batman and robin in 1997 was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting idiotic action scenes and painfully flashy costumes,negative
now in 1999 end of days not the end of days is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold,negative
is this the end of a powerful action stars longlived career,negative
will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past terminator terminator 2 judgement day predator,negative
or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past commando red sonja true lies,negative
it doesnt look that way,negative
end of days begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably due to the formation of the stars on that night will be the carrier of satans baby the hour before new years of 2000,negative
fortunately for the movies sake the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers subway trains in dark tunnels and a myriad of inept nypd officers,negative
its an action films dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up,negative
imagine if the girl had lived in anytown usa where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office,negative
arnold schwarzenegger jericho cane in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church who is trying to hide the girl or in some cases trying to kill her and satan gabriel byrne who is trying to make her pregnant,negative
if the devil is successful the world will no longer exist as we know it,negative
jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 he once had faith but no longer does and 2 his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it,negative
jericho cane is your cliched bythenumbers hero right up to his name,negative
arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can,negative
he shouts at everyone from cops to priests to the devil,negative
in one truly hilarious scene which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point jericho screams to the devil you are a,negative
choir boy,negative
you are a choir boy,negative
those two lines marked the high points of this film,negative
a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor,negative
end of days fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne,negative
byrne playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie,negative
he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time,negative
the annoying thing about his character however is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho,negative
i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody,negative
the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances,negative
kevin pollak who plays the partner and close friend of jericho is the supposedly funny character in the film every action movie has one,negative
the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line,negative
robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satans baby with extreme annoyance,negative
she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter or any of the viewers in the audience,negative
in one unnecessary scene tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off,negative
is this her job in the film,negative
the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible,negative
you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does,negative
this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie,negative
in a last attempt to make this movie good special effects are used to try to entertain the audience,negative
but without a memorable action scene in the whole film the director has not done his job successfully,negative
this film would have gotten a c if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted you are a,negative
choir boy,negative
for two hours,negative
9 its pathetic attempt at improving on a shakespeare classic,negative
8 its just another piece of teen fluff,negative
7 kids in high school are not that witty,negative
6 the wittiness is not witty enough,negative
5 the comedy is not funny,negative
4 the acting is poor,negative
3 the music,negative
2 the poster,negative
1 its worse than shes all that,negative
10a classic 9borderline classic 8excellent 7good 6better than average 5average 4disappointing 3poor 2awful 1a crap classic,negative
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon,negative
now i personally remember those films as a starring a major motion picture star b being funny c having great action sequences d great chemistry e decent character development,negative
hmmm okay now on to my review of chill factor,negative
plot a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an exarmy general to propose a nuclear device to international prospects,negative
when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps they must keep it cool on ice and rush it over to an army base before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit and kills millions of people,negative
critique speed on an icecream truck is probably the pitch that was used to sell this onetone movie to its backers but unfortunately the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tensionfilled original two hours of cinema is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film and the lethal weapon movies stood for,negative
this film is seasoned in cliches with plenty of badly written dialogue over the top acting from cuba gooding jr zero chemistry between the two leads and horribly tacky bad guys tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe,negative
my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously written that we just had to crack up,negative
that and the formula for the films script which followed the proverbial 12 and you guessed it 3 scenario,negative
and what about all those catchy hip names to get us to relate to the characters elvis,negative
and nighshift oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters and yes it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel,negative
it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr got involved in this oneweekoldbluecheesesmelling project,negative
did they actually think that it would boost their careers or did they know that the script sucked but discounted any fall from grace knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall,negative
most probably the latter,negative
have you seen either fled or bulletproof,negative
well despite the slight differences in plot the essentials are basically the same here,negative
you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people having no choice but to work together to get somewhere hating each other at first but over time learning to respect one another as individuals,negative
yawn,negative
add to that the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black drive black cars and black vans and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head,negative
not too conspicuous eh,negative
call me a partypooper but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy this film just doesnt even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining,negative
one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island do not a fun buddyaction flick make,negative
show cuba the money everybody,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars this is not a little known fact or anything but damn is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like greatlooking actor johnny depp,negative
skeets reallife nicknames include chester skeeter and mosquito,negative
he stands 61 was born in north carolina and got married in 1997 to that sexkitten actress from clay pigeons 7 510,negative
georgina cates,negative
they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs,negative
skeet has a long scar on his chest from openheart surgery done when he was 10 to correct a ventricle defect,negative
actor cuba gooding jr was born in the bronx new york,negative
in 1984 he breakdanced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles,negative
he stands 510,negative
actress hudson leick who plays one of the bad in his movie is better known from her role as callisto on the popular tv series xena princess warrior,negative
this film reportedly had a budget of 40 million,negative
im not exactly sure where all this money went but it certainly did not register onscreen,negative
interestingly enough director hugh johnson who makes his big screen debut with this film was the cinematographer on the 1996 film white squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle g i,negative
jane 6 510,negative
in 1970s many european intellectuals especially those on the left political hemisphere became obsessed with the rise of fascism,negative
which wasnt so hard to expect because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies,negative
in such times when political involvement could be associated with noble passion many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of prewar europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany,negative
of course there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other less noble reasons,negative
for them moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era,negative
which naturally made some of those films very popular among teen audience,negative
one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass who later made career shooting expensive stylish soft porn,negative
salon kitty his 1976 film is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2,negative
in 1939 walter schellenberg one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats,negative
none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents and that all the rooms happened to be bugged,negative
the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty nominal madame of the brothel didnt know the real purpose of that enterprise,negative
screenplay by tinto brass of course simplifies the story and changes few names,negative
schellenberg is now wallenberg helmut berger ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top,negative
kitty kellerman ingrid thulin apart from being madam has a second job as a cabaret singer,negative
caught in the net of depravity is sweet innocent girl margerithe theresa ann savoy thrown into brothel,negative
there she falls in love with customer hans reiter bekim fehmiu disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe,negative
when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel she finds out that the place is bugged,negative
she informs the madam of the real situation and both women decide to confront wallenberg,negative
those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation,negative
but although salon kitty doesnt happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn although not very successful some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict this time between powerhungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty,negative
unfortunately brass seems to overuse other cinematical references probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino viscontis the damned but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulins unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minellis musical numbers from cabaret,negative
all in all salon kitty is failure although with some very interesting moments,negative
the world on land its just too big for me,negative
starring tim roth pruitt taylor vince bill nunn clarence williams iii,negative
rated r,negative
the legend of 1900s is the years most absurd movie a rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast,negative
it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful as ever as a guy named,negative
1900,negative
you heard right,negative
his name is in all actuality 1900,negative
he was born on an ocean liner on 111900 uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny a ship crewman,negative
1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of dannys fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matters,negative
well when 1900 is about 9 or so he starts wondering all around the ship,negative
one day he discovers a grand piano,negative
he sits down and starts playing,negative
miraculously what comes out is beautiful,negative
a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age,negative
when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulations 1900 replies f ck the regulations,negative
ho ho ho,negative
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land,negative
when hes about 30ish and can play the piano like nobodys business onboard comes another musician,negative
his name is max pruitt taylor vince and he plays the trumpet,negative
after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm he sits him down on the piano next to him takes the pianos braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall taking them with it,negative
how the chair theyre sitting on and the piano dont separate i dont know but this apparently isnt the kind of thing were supposed to ask,negative
after that 1900 and max become friends,negative
max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but 1900 has no intention of doing so,negative
whats more he doesnt even want his music to go anywhere without him when a record company hears about his talents they come on board to make a record of his music but after finding out that gasp,negative
theyre going to make millions of copies he breaks the record,negative
the conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship gets off himself he stumbles upon a record of 1900s music in a store,negative
the record shouldnt exist because a 1900 never stepped on dry land and b the one record that was made on the ship was broken,negative
ladies and gentlemen its a mystery,negative
the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements,negative
were supposed to be roused by a climactic,negative
piano duel,negative
there isnt anything in this movie with the potential to compel,negative
1900 comes off as a whiny brooding extremely unlikable man i cant recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life,negative
ditto for max who doesnt seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900,negative
tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf theres no spirit no gusto to the character,negative
he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship but to us he is dead,negative
pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit,negative
the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel,negative
the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many,negative
this effort is utterly limp and lifeless,negative
at once ridiculous boring narrowsighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten,negative
what hath kevin williamson wrought,negative
while the horror movie revival spurred on by his scream has yielded a few decent entries in the genreiknowwhatyoudidlastsummer halloween h20 and scream2 it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films,negative
those williamsonless postscream efforts among them wishmaster and the recent disturbingbehavior have been frightening all rightfrighteningly insultingly bad,negative
add to that list urbanlegend which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy,negative
the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas,negative
first the opening sequence like that of scream is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling,negative
this sequence in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini natasha gregson wagner is decapitated while driving also reveals the other obviously williamsonesque touch the killers look,negative
dressed in a large hooded parka wielding an axe the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the iknow fisherman,negative
sans the hook,negative
one thing horta does not borrow from williamson however is the intriguing premise,negative
students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legendsthose contemporary bits of mythology passed from person to person group to group year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness,negative
it hardly matters if they are true or not such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi he didnt,negative
michelle slain by the killer lurking in the backseat of lore is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true as the body count rises fellow pendleton student natalie alicia witt suspects not only a link between the murders but a personal link to her past as well,negative
the setup shows promise but the story never takes off due in large part to horta and the director the aptly named jamie blanks who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares,negative
too many of the wouldbe shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues and the films chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that scream tried to subvert like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they shouldand couldrun out the front door,negative
but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches theres also the climactic villain confession in which a contrived and waytooconvenient motive is revealed not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick which is a cliche in any film genre,negative
banks and hortas intentional attempts at humor are also lame the fact that the best gags are lazy injokey references to the other credits of costars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor,negative
some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed but im not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so,negative
the filmmakers dont get much help from their onscreen talent,negative
i was far from a fan of bland iknow,negative
starlet jennifer love hewitt but id talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesencechallenged leading man jared leto,negative
dawsonscreek star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo gayheart displays all the depth and range of well a noxzema spokeswoman and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor,negative
granted the cast is hampered by their material,negative
loretta devine who has done some fine work in films such as waitingtoexhale is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grierworshiping campus security guard,negative
the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one mannamely kevin williamsonto stay alive,negative
if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as urbanlegend the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers many victims,negative
synopsis bigbreasted and dimwitted sculptress britt gets really mad at her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his thoughttransference experiments instead of her art showings,negative
elderly evil scientist everett longstreet switches minds with britts boy in the meantime and goes completely mental,negative
comments naked souls opens with a naked woman and the movie makes no illusion that its a scifi vehicle designed to show pamela andersons um talents,negative
if you are really interested in seeing andersons talents however i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape now available on home video,negative
at least with that movie you dont have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like eclectic,negative
a premise does exist in the movie,negative
basically while anderson wears skimpy clothes which barely contain her talents she practices her art brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women,negative
her boyfriend meanwhile spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of dead prison inmates because this will make a difference to humanity,negative
whatever,negative
the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up,negative
be grateful,negative
after we meet the evil everett longstreet lots of technobabble and mystical mumbojumbo get tossed about pammy has sex replete with cheesy makeout music and minds get transferred,negative
never fear though pammy uses her sharp mental abilities ahem to save her boyfriend in the end,negative
unfortunately no one saves the movie,negative
avoid this wouldbe scifi thriller unless youre in for a good laugh or two,negative
susan grangers review of glitter 20th centuryfox,negative
theres less here than meets the eye,negative
or put it this way if you thought madonna was awful in shanghai surprise mariah careys worse in this reworking of a star is born,negative
she plays billie frank who despite being abandoned by her mother valerie pettiford believes shes destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is,negative
youve got this amazing gift and you gotta use it her roommate says,negative
your voice its incredible says another singer,negative
i aint never met anyone like you proclaims julian dice black max beesley the hot new york dj who becomes her svengalilike,negative
problem is her signature song i didnt mean to turn you on is wretched,negative
and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to exploit her by having her wear a bikini the audience bursts into laughter,negative
exploit mariah carey who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow,negative
come on,negative
writer kate laniers script is fatuous and director vondie curtishall doesnt have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and as a result of their incompetence whisperyvoiced ms carey seems to be embarrassed onscreen,negative
she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a closeup pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes,negative
talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline theres an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view,negative
perhaps one of the reasons ms carey suffered her highlypublicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 glitter is a pathetic 1,negative
right now its tops on my list of the worst of 2001,negative
this is an adaptation of h g wells acclaimed novel the invisible man,negative
the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue,negative
the director is paul verhoven,negative
that plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer should be enough to lure us into the theatre,negative
the problem is to keep us there,negative
i cant imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time,negative
working on a top secret military project sebastian caine kevin beacon an eccentric genius that calls himself god has discovered the secret to invisibility,negative
the first two faces are completed,negative
now it is time for the next logical step human,negative
caine volunteers for this risky experiment,negative
but when he is made invisible something goes wrong,negative
while his exgirlfriend linda elisabeth shue desperately tries to find something to return him to normal he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower,negative
but thats not the bad thing an unexpected sideeffect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania,negative
he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine,negative
soon every sense of decency is forgotten,negative
the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alienripoff where caine is walking like a half finished terminator spooking scaring and killing everybody,negative
though its based on a novel called the invisible man the title has been ironically changed to hollow man that sums up the film very nicely,negative
this is a very silly production,negative
laughable actually,negative
apparently verhovens imagination doesnt stretch too far,negative
for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls locker room undetected,negative
it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie,negative
being invisible gives you the opportunity to be who you are to do what you want without being influenced by society,negative
in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences,negative
the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about,negative
all that the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat,negative
caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man,negative
but since this is a modernization in other words a dehumanization he doesnt stop there,negative
he becomes a rapist,negative
and then of course a murderer,negative
youll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place,negative
shues talent is barely seen josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent,negative
kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully,negative
his face is not seen for the most part of the film and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice,negative
there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing,negative
in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place,negative
being probably the best technical achievement since jurassic park they are absolutely amazing,negative
we observe the layers of skin muscle tissue and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible,negative
we see a beating heart inflating lungs and veins pulsing with newlypumped blood,negative
there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke fire air and water but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for,negative
what is truly disturbing is that with a great book talented actors and a grand budget this could have been so much more,negative
pretty much like jan de bont twister haunting paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary,negative
he was responsible for several good films basic instinct and starship troopers and some incredibly bad films showgirls total recall but he has never made anything that was great,negative
in a way hollow man fits perfectly in this collection,negative
its not better or worse than verhovens average film,negative
he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues,negative
and so instead of depth and chills verhoven inserts some of his trademarks stupid dialogue and lots of dull action with blood and naked bodies,negative
he even throws in some of the worst of film clich s the slowly advancing fireball the villain who comes back from the dead etc etc and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year youll be screaming nooooo,negative
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion,negative
and all we can ask is why,negative
the answer is simple,negative
though hollywood is a movie producing machine the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money,negative
it has to be about telling stories not marketing them,negative
it has to be about transporting us to a different place to dazzle us with magic and cleverness,negative
to make us care to make us think and feel,negative
verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that,negative
its all flesh and bones but no soul,negative
a void where its imagination should be,negative
i have never been a star trek fan and to tell the truth out of the five films in the series that i have seen 1 2 3 8 9 i have disliked all of them,negative
i do however always go into one of these with an open mind and the ninth film in the series star trek insurrection is no exception,negative
dropping almost completely the hardcore scifi element of the previous one in the series first contact insurrection tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people known as the baku as well as the fountain of youth,negative
at the start of the picture the villagers go under attack by a second alien species known as the sona who want to push all of the baku out so that their own race will not die out,negative
also attacking the baku is data brent spiner a robot from the star trek enterprise,negative
after returning to jeanluc picard patrick stewart and the gang on their space ship no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force,negative
so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the baku where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants a sultry kind alien woman donna murphy who is over sixhundredyearsold but looks to only be in her thirties,negative
star trek insurrection is a completely unoriginal and cheaplooking installment in the series and is a big step down from 1996s first contact which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different,negative
in insurrection however it plays like a lowrent episode of the television show due to the smallscale generic storyline and an emphasis on oneliners rather than excitement,negative
the film was filled with nearly nonstop comedy and worse yet most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff,negative
meanwhile when there were action sequences they were not at all interesting or inventive relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very very slowly,negative
this plot device which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays is getting old fast,negative
are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax,negative
another element of star trek films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later,negative
although donna murphy who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103minute running time alfre woodard was far superior in first contact,negative
she should have returned for this one but i dont blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movies disappointing and often lifeless screenplay by michael piller,negative
star trek insurrection is perhaps the weakest film in the star trek series although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst star trek v the final frontier,negative
insurrection is the type of safe sequel that will bewilder nonfans since it is so lowtech compared to most of todays blockbuster action films although most of these are honestly not very good either and should disappoint the loyal trekkies since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts,negative
on second thought they probably should have completely thrown the script out,negative
that way they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness,negative
kids today they dont just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr loving on the ladies,negative
no they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department namely playing baseball,negative
through a series of drippy voiceovers we are informed that theres no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues where college alsorans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention,negative
our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham as where he is hoping for his big break,negative
its only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a womans thong dont ask that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne struggling to make a name for himself that neither his father fred ward nor brother jason gedrick pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries and that the local beauty tenley tenley,negative
jessica biel is so far out of his league that he probably shouldnt even bother,negative
but of course he makes a play for her,negative
summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee brittany murphy the alienation felt by ryans nonbaseball playing best friend gabriel mann or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles marc blucas,negative
worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that 70s shows wilmer valderrama and beverly dangelo both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs robinsonlike substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham,negative
in fact virtually all of summer catch feels like its been done better somewhere else,negative
for starters the film has a major question of identity,negative
its definitely not a sports movie and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance,negative
the worst part is the amateurish script cowritten by an arli writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 chockfull of phony emotion,negative
by the end it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart,negative
dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice,negative
coach brian dennehy just loving the fact that hes got some work on the big screen is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint,negative
ryans catcher matthew lillard playing himself again is on hand to tell ryan to play catch with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy,negative
ryans stoner best friend is on hand to give the gogetemtigerwerebehindyou talk,negative
and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarmingnuzzlyfollowyourdreams counsel,negative
before long you start to wonder is freddy prinze jr is capable of having a thought of his own,negative
dont answer that,negative
the only real joy in the film is found in biels character and not just because of the skimpy outfits which are also usually wet,negative
shes the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role taking the rebellingagainstdaddy character to at least a passing grade,negative
when shes on screen the time flies by,negative
when shes not you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long,negative
for a pg13 teen romance despite nearconstant sexual innuendo one has to ask warner brothers what were you thinking,negative
for her part biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards,negative
hollywood is either about to eat her alive,negative
or vice versa,negative
either way good luck jessica,negative
as for freddie if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year prinzes next summer catch is liable to be a venereal disease,negative
woof too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger because thats whats required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis asof all thingsa psychologist,negative
not since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude,negative
alas mickey rourke we hardly knew ye,negative
story opens with a campy kickwillis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy,negative
she goes splat he goes ugh and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind,negative
really,negative
the good doctor then moves to sunny l a where he rooms with an old college chum scott bakula a therapist whos getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group,negative
buddy bites it in the second reel no surprise there and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats,negative
for his troubles as therapy man willis gets to share some cutfromnc17 love scenes with the lovers jane march while dodging nails cars and rattlesnakes,negative
whyd it have to be snakes,negative
color of night is the worst movie of the year,negative
period,negative
forget north clifford or heaven help us even on deadly ground,negative
here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you cant help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming,negative
for starters the group is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis,negative
these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy,negative
playing a prissy cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif alone may set the psychology profession back ten years,negative
the plots a wreck with laughable dialogue pointless pov shifts and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes,negative
director richard rush who once helmed freebie and the bean doesnt seem to mind,negative
unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany setpieces to make the effort almost worth watching,negative
his token freeway chase is ok but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala most recently fatal analysis,negative
acting credits are acrosstheboard awful,negative
willis can be forgiven because hes filming die hard 3 as we speak,negative
but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop,negative
or lesley ann warrens stereotypical sex addict,negative
or worst offender jane march as a mysterygirlwhosnorealmystery,negative
shudder,negative
bottom line how they all kept straight faces ill never know,negative
bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures,negative
mercury rising adds to a growing list including such stinkers as the jackal last man standing striking distance and the last boy scout of stale actioners he has headlined,negative
and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix it is every bit as stale,negative
art jeffries bruce willis is your typical tormented fbi agent,negative
you know the type haunted by his job yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist,negative
enter simon miko hughes an autistic boy who like rain man and all other autistic people is a savant,negative
he can merely gaze at a superencrypted message and while little computer beeps go off in his head he can understand what it says,negative
naturally this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government,negative
lt col nicholas kudrow alec baldwin an nsa official bubbling over with evil has spent countless time and money implementing the newest unbreakable code mercury,negative
however when two of his underlings robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman publish a mercuryencrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness simon cracks the code,negative
naturally this infuriates kudrow who sends a terminatorlike hitman l l,negative
ginter to eliminate the security hazard,negative
and thats where art jeffries comes in,negative
for some reason thats never explained in the film the fbi is called in to help and through a series of intricate machinations art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy,negative
in a few unrealistic sequences he enlists the aid of a stranger stacey kim dickens to help out but she is given very little to do overall,negative
the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous,negative
why bother trying to kill the kid i,negative
mean who would know,negative
its not like the kid or anyone else for that matter knew he was cracking a government supercypher,negative
and even if he is eliminated what does that help,negative
hes already proven that mercury can be broken,negative
theres always the chance that someone else would crack it but,negative
i guess without a kid in jeopardy theres not much of a movie here,negative
for all its faults the film actually starts relatively well once you pass the painfully familiar teaser,negative
the film flirts with developing real characters and a semblance of a plot then,negative
mr terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill quickly,negative
miko hughes does a decent job for his age at creating a touching performance,negative
however dont go to this film looking for any new insights into autism not that many people will,negative
instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddycop movie think cop and a half with a twist,negative
willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type,negative
rather than creating a nuanced character baldwin simply oozes sliminess,negative
and for willis part he simply recycles the stock role of the loner agent which he has honed in the die hard series,negative
as almost an afterthought about halfway through the film carelessly gives him a character trait an addiction and then drops it in the next scene,negative
but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay,negative
this film wasnt well thought out at all,negative
the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible,negative
the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member,negative
at first the bad scenes just trickle in but by the gruesomely bad finale theyre a veritable flood,negative
the films few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode,negative
but theyre not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile,negative
mercury rising is a thriller that youre more likely to groan at than cheer,negative
eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights,negative
as the movies writer director executive producer and star murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails,negative
but at the same time hell receive all of the credit if it succeeds,negative
should you sacrifice your hardearned cash to support murphys risky gamble,negative
well that depends on whom you trust more me or eddie murphy,negative
heres what murphy thinks i think the audience is expecting a good time,negative
they gonna get sexy,negative
they gonna get funny,negative
they gonna get drama,negative
they gonna get all of that,negative
i think its the best movie ive done paramount radio network,negative
heres what i think harlem nights is charmless unoriginal disappointing and almost without question the worst film of the actors career i havent seen best defense,negative
and guess whos to blame,negative
the movies problem is not murphys direction harlem nights is a fairly good looking film,negative
no the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled,negative
murphys awful script is the culprit,negative
lets count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting,negative
1 murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture,negative
yes he even outdoes his own work in raw,negative
practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word,negative
and after 15 minutes it gets irritating,negative
2 murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast,negative
richard pryor redd foxx michael lerner and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes,negative
each of them shines occasionally but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle,negative
3 the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men,negative
murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life which is really neither here nor there,negative
but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 000 movie screens across the country its another matter altogether,negative
youre forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff,negative
for instance murphy punches della reese in the stomach,negative
and he shoots jasmine guy in the head,negative
this is a meanspirited movie folks,negative
lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore but only because she doesnt have any scenes with murphy,negative
thank god he might have run her over with a bulldozer,negative
4 murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date,negative
the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film,negative
murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality,negative
sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair,negative
5 the plot is a shameless ripoff of the sting,negative
if youre going to make another sting movie youve got to do something original,negative
murphys tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem circa 1938 fails to add anything new to the formula,negative
6 to get laughs murphy makes fun of stuttering,negative
you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped,negative
7 murphys idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life,negative
for what,negative
for shooting reeses little toe off,negative
needless to say murphy shows little if any promise or imagination as a screenwriter,negative
in all fairness however a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie,negative
danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take,negative
aiello stands out in the large ensemble cast he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character a racist detective with mob ties,negative
aiellos zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice,negative
another bright spot is arsenio hall who has a hilarious showstopping cameo as a crybaby gangster hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy,negative
in fact halls ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie,negative
unfortunately his character is completely irrelevant to the plot murphy should have given hall a much bigger role,negative
of course ive already mentioned that i didnt care for murphys character but i have to admit that i did love his neckties,negative
they are simply spectacularalmost worth the price of admission,negative
the blues brothers was a wonderful film a hilarious comedy packed with good music,negative
it cried out for a sequel but john belushis untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea,negative
however eighteen years have passed and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged,negative
unfortunately its a sequel not worthy of the original,negative
the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended,negative
elwood blues dan aykroyd is just getting out of jail his brother jake having recently died,negative
as in the first film he first visits mother mary stigmata kathleen freeman and then sets about getting the band back together,negative
john belushis absence leaves a terrible hole in the film and although three new characters are created to fill the void it is still very noticeable,negative
first theres cabel joe morton the illegitimate son of elwoods stepfather played by cab calloway in the first movie,negative
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff chasing the blues brothers band,negative
next theres mighty mack john goodman a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band,negative
finally theres buster j,negative
evan bonifant a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band,negative
the plotting of the film is hardly original it,negative
seems to be almost a clone of the original,negative
elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band they then travel while being pursued by the police and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale,negative
the first film had neonazis as the random element this time around the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role,negative
in fact the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original,negative
remember the classic performance at country bobs where they like both types of music country and western from the first movie,negative
well this movie has a performance at a country fair where the band is expected to play bluegrass music,negative
theres the massive police car pileup although this time the gag falls completely flat,negative
theres even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus james brown,negative
there are plenty of recurring characters too,negative
in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs murphy,negative
frank oz a prison guard in the first film makes an appearance here as the prison warden,negative
as the stars the new blues brothers dont live up to their legacy,negative
aykroyd is more loquacious yet much flatter as elwood,negative
john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack,negative
joe morton has the deepest character but not a terribly interesting one as cab,negative
and whats the deal with the orphan,negative
it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesnt mesh at all with the rest of the film,negative
at least bonifant isnt as precocious as he could have been in the role,negative
but the true star and the only saving grace of the film is the music,negative
and the film is packed with it even during and after the ending credits,negative
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the originals by your man medley the music is very much enjoyable,negative
to top it off the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances,negative
b b king blues traveler eric clapton travis tritt wilson pickett erykah badu bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there,negative
unfortunately the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot,negative
if simply copying the original blues brothers wasnt bad enough writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down removing any memorable characters and replacing them with flashy but unbelievable magical gimmicks,negative
its a shame,negative
buy the soundtrack and avoid the film,negative
better yet rewatch the original youll,negative
have a much better time,negative
frank detorris bill murray a single dad who lives on beer and junk food with no apparent understanding of sanitation or hygiene much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane elena franklin,negative
when he uses the 10 second rule to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimps cage at the zoo and downs it he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system,negative
inside his skin the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the votepandering of mayor phlegmming voice of william shatner so its up to one frank pd white blood cell voice of chris rock to save the day in peter and bobby farrellys osmosis jones,negative
the city of frank is a brightly animated animation directed by piet kroon and tom sito cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance,negative
hes inadvertently teamed up with drix voice of david hyde pierce tvs frasier a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers to dispense,negative
this quarrelling duo are about to go on a fantastic voyage in order to hunt down thrax voice of laurence fishburne the virus intent on shutting down frank,negative
while the animation is certainly colorful to look at osmosis jones story is a hackneyed one,negative
the story cries out for puny puns but we only get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor drix graduated phi beta capsule he departs on a bus headed for bladder,negative
neither the hero or villain is particularly interesting thrax looks like an animated predator although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick,negative
adults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the landscape,negative
meanwhile back in live action land bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking grossout joke,negative
theres no particular enjoyment to be found watching him vomit on molly shannon she plays shanes teacher mrs boyd or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table,negative
one must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a childs father will play to the family audience as well,negative
rest assured the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke,negative
while far less offensive than the farrellys last effort me myself and irene that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carreys hijinx,negative
osmosis jones will probably be ok for the kids but the farrellys playing for the family audience is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune,negative
plot outline wendy samantha press a jazz singer loves mack hugo race a criminal and wanna be rock singer whos planning a bank heist,negative
mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops one an inexperienced rookie dominic sweeney the other john flaus a worn out veteran who frequents wendys jazz club,negative
theyre tailing mack because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption,negative
meanwhile wendys sexually awakener fifteen year old sister rebecca elmaloglou has moved in with her and is secretly watching mack and wendys late night love trysts much zaniness ensues,negative
the review main problem first about 2 of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work,negative
unfortunately trying to cast hugo race as a violent sexy criminal falls into the what the hell where they thinking category that takes up 98 of the rest,negative
but hell its not as if hes the only problem in this wellintentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller,negative
leads race and samantha press are wooden and dull hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on,negative
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes helped no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut,negative
the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two,negative
which is unfortunately the other main story isnt any great shakes either,negative
the second part concerning two cops political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled,negative
at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on a situation that didnt improve on repeated viewing,negative
there is no doubt that this films achilles heel is its script,negative
as for the rest of the cast its a mixed bag,negative
john flaus one of australias most criminally underused actors is in top form as the withering alcoholic jazz fan cop who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder,negative
although he falters at one point when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon but believe me they way it was written no one could have pulled it off,negative
dominic sweeney is fine though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isnt given a whole lot to do,negative
pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo but her character seems extraneous to the story well at least until the final scenes,negative
i must admit in too deep does have some impressive qualities not the least of which is it visual element,negative
cinematographers mark gilfedder peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city which is akin to turning london into san paolo,negative
the bar is an oppressive red like all of its patrons are being baked while they drink outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night,negative
if only deborah parsons script could have supported this idea better,negative
having two directors colin south john tatoulis doesnt help either the most glaring example of which is the final scene where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action and more importantly it doesnt pull away to anything else,negative
it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance,negative
it has no reason to it its just bad direction,negative
and ultimately that is what sums up in too deep its tries to be good and you want it to work but its just lacking the talent behind it that it needs to succeed,negative
except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through,negative
bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan actress and author once married now violently divorced and back together one last time for their daughter mollys paula marshall wedding,negative
lilly and dan hate each other passionately so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again,negative
each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other,negative
molly married now only 24 hours runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith jamie denton tries to console the abandoned spouses,negative
in mollys search for her parents she somehow falls in love with lillys paparazzo joey danny nucci,negative
meanwhile the newlywed keith ends up consoling dans wife rowena gail ogrady in bed,negative
the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious,negative
im no dan quayle but i thought it was a bit creepy,negative
the message seemed to be ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish,negative
family values aside theres something cruel about all this,negative
perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy but the movie is a romantic comedy,negative
we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps,negative
reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable,negative
lillys husband is a newage flake who rambles about emotional valet parking so we can write him off as irrelevant,negative
dans wife is vain manipulative and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch,negative
mollys husband is a careerconscious selfcentered republican politician who thinks shes too fat and just for good measure he also fucked dans wife so we can write him off as a prick,negative
everyone else falls in love,negative
but still that somehow doesnt justify the actions of the movies main characters,negative
hes a prick or shes a bitch is no defense,negative
the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog often during heated arguments and by aboveaverage performances by midler and farina breaking out of his characteractor mold,negative
other than that its a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick,negative
bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan,negative
to pull something like this off you need to have a sense of wit and style with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines,negative
something like the underground worm thriller tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements and in return the film was tremendous fun,negative
with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player bats mainly plays its premise for straightarrow horror,negative
judging by the ridiculous premise this was not exactly a wise move,negative
the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcocks the birds but fails miserably,negative
done right it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema,negative
unfortunately bats is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly terribly wrong,negative
the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be,negative
i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom bats is aimed toward,negative
those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats,negative
these bats are not very nice because they eat a lot of people,negative
boy are these bats ugly,negative
they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them superduper smart,negative
theyve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all,negative
a whole bunch of people in texas get killed so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats,negative
they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with but the bats are pretty smart so its sorta hard to do,negative
the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good,negative
but no bats is probably too violent for preschoolers,negative
the film directed by louis morneau should have ventured straight into video stores,negative
on the small screen perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations,negative
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure the film is poorly written poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude,negative
even the bats themselves are cheesy and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed,negative
the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey lou diamond phillips who embodies every pathetic stereotype a smalltown authority figure usually portrays he chomps on a cigar struts contentedly in his boots etc,negative
the scientist is dr sheila casper dina meyer who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as the best in her field,negative
meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable but everything about dr casper is recycled beyond recognition,negative
her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hoopers tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in jaws,negative
everything revolving around bats is tired drivel which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up,negative
the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw with voices dubbed in later,negative
in fact that may have worked out better in the end,negative
take one glance at caspers batloathing sidekick jimmy leon and youll have immediate deja vu hes the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie constructed specifically for timed comic relief,negative
unfortunately none of his comic interludes are funny,negative
in the role of deranged mad scientist dr mccabe the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch,negative
mccabe accidentally released two experimental test subjects and the virus spread to other bats,negative
the entire town of gallup texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else,negative
something like when is the damn movie going to be over,negative
i just want my money,negative
the bats are ugly i must say,negative
theres the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing but mainly the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery,negative
only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been but by the absurdly stupid climax its way too late in the game for a decent recovery,negative
characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire,negative
lets explore the logic there is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population,negative
you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one and after that there are only 18 000 more of them,negative
this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind bats,negative
i went to blair witch project 2 book of shadows with the highest of hopes,negative
the original film released last summer was genuinely scary and terrifying i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor,negative
unfortunately my hopes were soon dashed,negative
as the movie opens the audience is shown pseudodocumentary clips of burkittsville maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie,negative
its a mostly humorous selfaware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film,negative
during this segment we are introduced to the protagonist a young man who sells blair witchrelated memorabilia from his website,negative
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously,negative
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies,negative
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarettesmoking doctor luridly leers above him,negative
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him,negative
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scenes are barely referred to again,negative
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie,negative
the movie cuts again this time to the present,negative
the young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan as in the first movie the character names are identical to the actors names although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so theres no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website,negative
we meet tristen and steven a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience,negative
steven is a skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria,negative
tristen on the other hand believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence,negative
she is wan and softspoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly,negative
she also complains that she feels nauseated i knew immediately that the character was pregnant and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out,negative
how did i know,negative
because in bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant,negative
the fourth member of their party is erica a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch not evil,negative
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery,negative
kim is dressed completely in black has extreme gothstyle makeup on and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch,negative
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect its never explained,negative
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised,negative
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parrs house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the nights events,negative
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well but after a few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere,negative
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down,negative
sexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens,negative
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary,negative
the next day the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristens manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds like snow,negative
the videotapes are missing but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found,negative
ooh,negative
spooky,negative
the team goes back to jeffreys house a creepy old civil warera warehouse in the heart of the woods to regroup and review the tapes,negative
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night,negative
wacky hijinks ensue,negative
tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird runelike burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket,negative
throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards,negative
when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours,negative
one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes,negative
okay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh,negative
nevermind,negative
this movie was awful,negative
simply awful,negative
the characters are broadlydrawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development,negative
erica is the natureloving wiccan,negative
tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman,negative
steven is the overbearing asshole,negative
kim is the antisocial goth girl,negative
old tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures,negative
how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic,negative
because shes pregnant,negative
how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl,negative
because she wears a lot of eye makeup,negative
how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy,negative
because he has jagged teeth and talks like hes straight out of deliverance,negative
this is weak storytelling at its worst,negative
rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action,negative
it didnt work,negative
on top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid,negative
honey you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie,negative
lets get on a plane home,negative
no,negative
i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out whats going on,negative
ok,negative
frankly by the end of the movie i was rooting for the witch,negative
i also felt that there was simply too much blood n gore in this film,negative
the first movie worked by never showing us the horror,negative
the witch was a palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact,negative
the horror was all offscreen and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be,negative
this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie,negative
blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the grossout,negative
this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffreys throat and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort,negative
knives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me to care,negative
this movie didnt stop with showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything,negative
by the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours,negative
it is all explained in fact it is all shown onscreen in loving detail,negative
i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because i find the monster so terrifying but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying,negative
i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind,negative
i found this to be a miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the directors intent then he needs to have some words with the writer because it was not made clear at all,negative
i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so,negative
and if there was no witch then what about the vanishing tree,negative
the snowfall of manuscript paper,negative
hm,negative
blair witch 2 book of shadows was a horrible movie,negative
from the poorlywritten characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the grossout shots it was a bad effort through and through,negative
anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landons fact based novel the king and i and its big expensive and soulless,negative
though goodlooking its lavish sets fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meersons script,negative
so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting,negative
this is jodie fosters first movie since the jawdroppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isnt the best choice to show off her acting chops,negative
shes trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens the uptight widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam now thailand with her son to instruct the kings chow yunfat son in the ways of the west because the ways of england are the ways of the world,negative
the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family 58 kids with 10 more in the way impressive no,negative
the eldest prince is none too happy about this father have i offended you in some way,negative
why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher but soon gets to know anna and her stern motherwholovesyou personality better and comes to like her,negative
meanwhile siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma,negative
the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britains doing which arouses suspicion in siam putting anna in an uncomfortable position,negative
she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the kings prejudices,negative
he though selfrighteous as ever cant help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly quietly develop affections for each other,negative
there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the kings younger daughters dies,negative
its your classic deathbed scene with the girls mournful eyes staring at her father who tries only semi successfully to maintain his composure,negative
anna then comes in and cries a bit,negative
the sequence was there for a purpose to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer,negative
im usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time i was just sitting there my emotions untouched,negative
this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren,negative
we never develop connections to the characters never given a reason to care,negative
this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant whose last film was ever after one of my favorites of 1998,negative
i do not doubt tennants ability to put together a decent movie but anna and the king aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient,negative
the sets and scenery are gorgeous but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur,negative
even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from 75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia,negative
we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with largerthanlife awe,negative
i liked both foster and yunfat who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles,negative
fosters generally stoic persona serves her well here as she is playing a reserved formal and rather underdeveloped character,negative
yunfat is especially effective perfectly conveying the king of siams sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts,negative
what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations,negative
the cast is great the director is talented and the budget is lavish but this illadvised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole,negative
this is an emotionless costume epic,negative
plot lara croft is british rich and kicks a lot of ass,negative
she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years and that lara holds the key to time well needless to say they want to nab it from her,negative
oh yeah lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts hummanahummanahummana,negative
critique angelina jolie was great in this movie,negative
there were also about three action scenes that were pretty cool to look at in this film,negative
uhhhhhm unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked,negative
bad dialogue generic sidekicks and bad guys a lame mystery yodaesque moments with mumbojumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end,negative
all in all this movie wasnt the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about especially since every other scene does feature jolies torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts but it was quite the letdown nonetheless especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool hip woman hero based on a popular video game,negative
i dont know i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west who didnt really tie the whole movie together all that well,negative
the film lacked energy a consistent pace and well a,negative
fun time,negative
i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie,negative
all that father crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing and im not even gonna mention his moustache hehehe,negative
why have this shite in the movie at all,negative
i especially hated the scenes in which some ghostlike figure friend or child would ramble on about lara crofts father while all the time im not giving one ounce of crap as to what theyre talking about,negative
i guess thats called lack of character development right,negative
thats when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen so that we could actually get into it and care about them,negative
i didnt care about anyone in this movie and was bored during most of its lets explain why were doing all this gobbledygook moments,negative
and even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass damn did she look sexy blasting those guns or what everybody else around her was so goddamn boring,negative
her butler was a throwaway with no personality her sidekick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word bugger and he says it a lot trust me and all of the socalled bad guys just spewed onedimension,negative
they had no spark no energy amongst them and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool see the trailer and youll know which ones im talking about the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bullcrap just buried it even further,negative
also for a movie thats supposed to be about all of these exotic locations i wasnt necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots and even less so with its interiors which all looked like they were shot in the same room,negative
mind you i wont go as far as to say that its the worst movie of the year remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr movies also but its definitely the worst film that ive seen during this summer movie season of course its still early and im sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike,negative
skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead trust,negative
me youll miss the boobs but end your night with some rocksolid porn and its all good,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
raiders of the lost ark 1010 the mummy 810 lost in space 710 the mummy returns 610 the generals daughter 310 romancing the stone 710 wild wild west 310 mission impossible 2 710,negative
showgirls is the first bigbudget bigstudio film to receive an nc17 rating,negative
and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence,negative
but if showgirls is any indication of hollywoods future the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american valuesbad moviemaking,negative
showgirls is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter,negative
director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas who collaborated on another shockvalue project 1992s basic instinct follow the plight of a young woman teen tv star elizabeth berkley determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer,negative
its a hackneyed premise to begin with so not surprisingly all of the stock characters are trucked out,negative
theres the demanding producer,negative
the loyal friend,negative
the bitchy competitor,negative
lest i forget the scummy club owner,negative
of course any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the films main attractionan endless parade of fullfrontal nudity,negative
unfortunately showgirls doesnt satisfy in this department,negative
verhoevens slambang inyourface style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic,negative
to make matters worse youll be forced to sit through the movies clothed scenes which dont cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history,negative
verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground but if its adult entertainment you want stay home and watch the playboy channel,negative
youll be the wiser for it,negative
a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto a russian science vessel,negative
well this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable scifi thriller,negative
anyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the virus known as man,negative
the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it,negative
no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies the movie is that predictable,negative
the story is full of very shallow characters that dont do much other than subsist,negative
the captain of the tug played by donald sutherland makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age looks to be in his 60s,negative
to add to this were shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks,negative
some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific in a typhoon no less,negative
none of the characters seem to work together at all they are always bickering and vying for some form of control,negative
this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable,negative
all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects,negative
the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves,negative
it looks genuinely fake granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish,negative
also on the topic of flaws the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly why,negative
if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics should it not be able to create them move faster,negative
regardless the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it,negative
as to the actual casting for the movie finally there is nothing to complain about,negative
the actors were superb but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles,negative
having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe,negative
watching these actors act this story out made it bearable if barely,negative
the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening,negative
so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre scifi thriller then you wont be too disappointed,negative
as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect,negative
this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv,negative
there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strongworded attack on a group of stoic doctors,negative
when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture,negative
you see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries,negative
i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it and i actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories,negative
i hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyacs shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey,negative
the badness of patch adams is stupefying,negative
its confounding,negative
i cant believe a film can be this bad,negative
and yet its based on a real man who probably has a good point to make,negative
in the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human,negative
in the beginning of the film patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesnt want to kill himself,negative
while there he notices that the doctors dont care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings,negative
so patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients,negative
he goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that its good to help people,negative
he also meets carin fischer monica potters the antimale med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor,negative
naturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams,negative
so patch decides that hes going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have,negative
and that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998,negative
on a superficial level the film is not particularly bad i wouldnt say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for i actually liked potters performance even if she is wasted,negative
but the film fails fundamentally in execution,negative
every scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard,negative
take for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on a bus,negative
we dont know patch yet but theres sad music and its supposed to make us really sad that hes sad,negative
later on patch makes a lot of progress he helps a dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively,negative
and when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad,negative
but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions,negative
real drama is characterbased,negative
you grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it,negative
we dont ever grow to know the dying patient hes simply a vehicle for patchs greatness,negative
real drama doesnt seem forced or present just to make the audience cry,negative
thats why patch adams is not real drama,negative
it goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene,negative
even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaimans sickening musical score,negative
sentimentality like this is indeed bad,negative
but its not as bad as halfbaked simplistic themes,negative
you see patch is a really great student,negative
he aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think hes cheating,negative
but patch doesnt think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor,negative
why dont we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds,negative
well patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients,negative
not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort,negative
most of us have to study,negative
and a doctor who really wants to help but doesnt know a toe from a finger probably wont be too successful in preventing death,negative
oh wait i almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life,negative
yes,negative
that is true,negative
and you can not do that without studying,negative
you can not do that without going to medical school,negative
what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later,negative
follow the rules,negative
bah,negative
who needs the rules,negative
only uptight doctors follow the rules,negative
the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants,negative
and then theres the free clinic issue which i find shockingly frighteningly idealistic,negative
a free clinic,negative
in the middle of the forest,negative
where patients can be taken to be helped,negative
for free,negative
how will patients be transported to the free clinic,negative
will it have an emergency room,negative
or is it just for mental patients,negative
and who may i ask will pay for it,negative
the film does give some token attempts to question patchs motives i think another character asks him how hes going to pay for it in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly dont explore or challenge patchs ideas to any meaningful extent,negative
reader please understand this i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams,negative
i know nothing about him,negative
if his beliefs mirror those of this film character then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them,negative
but regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony,negative
and in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does a lot of shouting,negative
actually robin williams does a lot of shouting,negative
he shouts a lot about helping people and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words,negative
i wont tell you that you cant be moved by his words because i too was moved by his words,negative
i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be,negative
patch adams is the cheapest of them all,negative
in my opinion a movie reviewers most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion,negative
but with soul survivors im so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous uncontrollable rant obligations damned,negative
however protocol forces me to do otherwise,negative
soul survivors tells the story of four collegebound friends cassandra melissa sagemiller is sweet and innocent,negative
party girl annabel eliza dushku of bring it on is dating worldweary harvard student matt wes bentley,negative
matt still has feelings for cassie who is now dating sean casey affleck,negative
driving back from a creepy gothic party the quartet gets into a horrific car crash,negative
sean dies leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her,negative
as cassie mopes through her classes she sees the ghost of sean all over the place urging her to follow him,negative
along with being plagued by other ghastly visions cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party,negative
annabel and matt try calming her down but no one shares casss visions,negative
she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself,negative
rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material,negative
in his directorial debut steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion,negative
when the movies camerawork isnt pedestrian its clich d,negative
carpenters need for closeups his camera following sagemiller from behind drain the movie of any anticipation,negative
we already know what to look for so why should we be surprised,negative
and the sense of scary atmosphere which was recently done so well in the others is nowhere to be found here,negative
carpenters script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness,negative
this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around,negative
the second lamest device of course is the oh it was all a dream resolution,negative
and guess what,negative
this movie has both,negative
not that the main body of the film which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown is anything worthwhile,negative
since theres no captivating dialogue no character chemistry exists anywhere,negative
thats a huge problem since the four main characters are supposed to be couples,negative
carpenter cant even get the smutty scenes right which are becoming more prevalent in pg13 movies like bring it on and get over it,negative
the film was recently recut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats,negative
ed,negative
when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael baystyle quick cuts,negative
and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint theyre fully clothed,negative
regardless any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity,negative
why wouldnt they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine,negative
why would they shower in their clothes,negative
what if they werent covered in latex paint,negative
the cast which will see better material in the future would be wise to leave this one off their resumes,negative
i felt sorry for affleck who ive liked in other movies and bentley who was great in american beauty,negative
dushku who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan,negative
as for sagemiller star of the aforementioned get over it i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person and not an object for gawking,negative
and im not even getting into luke wilsons role as a priest,negative
at least hes friends with wes anderson,negative
bottom line soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it,negative
the word to describe sharon stone is wonder,negative
not that she is a wonder but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent,negative
she has a dynamic screen presence in basic instinct turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in casino but possesses neither of those here,negative
stone teams up with private school headmasters wife isabelle adjani to kill adjanis thoroughly unlikable husband chazz palminteri,negative
in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock as in homage to read steal from it turns out that someone saw them or hes not dead or maybe,negative
kathy bates turns in a credible if unspectacular performance as an investigative police detective,negative
her character is a bit dull but realistic although her actions at the end are puzzling,negative
adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation,negative
its stone that is a disappointment among the actors,negative
how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one,negative
costumed in skintight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring not enticingly dangerous,negative
even the threat or promise of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out,negative
on the positive side there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive,negative
that is if you can put up with stones cardboard cutout character and scenes directly lifted from hitchs movies,negative
because im a scientist,negative
thats what we do,negative
dr alexander mccabe bob gunton in response to why he created evil bats,negative
alright folks stop me if youve heard this one genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals assisted by a specialist in the particular animals field must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth,negative
oh yeah the military is on their way to bomb the town as well so they are running short on time,negative
sound familiar,negative
such is the plot of the destination films release of bats,negative
dina meyer stars as the bat specialist sheila who is pulled from her research along with her annoying sidekick played with irritating deftness by leon in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently,negative
with the help of the local sheriff lou diamond phillips a cdc official carlos jacott and a scientist bob gunton sheila discovers it is indeed bats who have been genetically altered by guntons character to be more aggressive and omnivorous in order to be used as a military weapon,negative
i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film,negative
theres not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good,negative
in this respect the film never disappointed me,negative
this film reaches a level that transcends the so bad its good level and borders on the downright insane,negative
the effects are awful the script is contrived and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously i think,negative
i challenge anyone to sit through the scene where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner with a straight face,negative
thankfully the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with,negative
dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in johnny mnemonic dragonheart and starship troopers,negative
the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit and this one is no exception,negative
while one never really gets the impression that meyers character could be a bat expert in reality one never really cares to doubt it either,negative
she gives as good a performance as could be expected plus shes nice to look at for an hour and a half,negative
lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero,negative
although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for whats going on in town for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats,negative
the only bad performance in the film is that of leons,negative
he is relegated to the im not sticking around here,negative
character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays,negative
anyone who cant immediately tell that bob gunton the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised but i highly doubt it,negative
even if he hadnt been the villain in just about every film hes ever been in so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever,negative
in fact his death is welcome because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale,negative
if the plot doesnt sound ridiculous to you yet then check out these little tidbits a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol,negative
an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctors orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force killing several townsfolk,negative
a government official blows off shelias instructions to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off by pulling a night job resulting in the death of an entire military unit,negative
a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it,negative
finally to top it all off this little texas town is showing nosferatu in its single screen theater for reference our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens and were lucky to even get kevin smiths dogma,negative
the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the illconceived bat puppets,negative
while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend whats going on the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more lowkey,negative
therefore we the audience get loving closeups of the most unrealistic rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film,negative
being able to see the puppeteers arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse,negative
after all of this if you still decide bats might be the movie for you dont say you havent been warned,negative
trust me when i say that its a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through,negative
i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in,negative
shes definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these,negative
the happy bastards quick movie review,negative
damn that y2k bug,negative
its got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother william this time in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on,negative
little do they know the power within,negative
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there virus still feels very empty like a movie going for all flash and no substance,negative
we dont know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere we dont know the origin of what took over the ship just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir and of course we dont know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout,negative
here its just hey lets chase these people around with some robots,negative
the acting is below average even from the likes of curtis,negative
youre more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20,negative
sutherland is wasted and baldwin well hes acting like a baldwin of course,negative
the real star here are stan winstons robot design some schnazzy cgi and the occasional good gore shot like picking into someones brain,negative
so if robots and body parts really turn you on heres your movie,negative
otherwise its pretty much a sunken ship of a movie,negative
paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what id consider a thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils,negative
starship troopers was essentially a bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be 45 silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage,negative
its not a completely successful film but as a failure its certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one,negative
my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange havent yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight,negative
i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop a bleak superhero satire with a robotic hero thats as touching as schwarzeneggers in t2,negative
that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics,negative
its violence seemed to be there for a purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience,negative
theres a jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him,negative
he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic,negative
its a startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punknoir,negative
in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wont shut up he impales a coworker drowns another and so on,negative
but why,negative
his character is introduced as a smug genius the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster,negative
the kind who just wont die,negative
hollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin whos saddled with the films worst lines ive lost cohesion again,negative
theyre a typical aaron spelling couple goodlooking but as vacant as george w bushs republican national convention speech i e,negative
bush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end,negative
to what end,negative
this actually got applause,negative
suddenly warren beatty doesnt look so absurd,negative
the rest of the films characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained oneliners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique,negative
ahh what a cynical time we live in,negative
as the picture opens we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility for what purpose is never hinted at,negative
theyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in a twist worthy of the films 1950s late show origins to impulsively experiment on himself,negative
caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his coworkers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead,negative
our mad scientist is turned invisible after several fxheavy complications then he inexplicably its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human,negative
begins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger,negative
it grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow,negative
like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days,negative
its an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun thrillaminute ride,negative
verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care,negative
the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick,negative
how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self,negative
a couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability,negative
hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in a serious manner to boot,negative
but oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway,negative
verhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable,negative
the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background,negative
its plainly obvious that verhoeven isnt exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well,negative
its funny that with all the technology 90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand,negative
most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks,negative
in fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat,negative
as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked,negative
the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy,negative
it happens when a lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pauses,negative
are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted,negative
its a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 the apex of the mad slasher craze,negative
those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer,negative
and theyre the only reason to check out hollow man preferably as a midweek bargain rental,negative
youve been warned,negative
but you probably wont listen will you,negative
tis a pity,negative
the yettobereleased krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy but buyer beware,negative
this movie cant make up its mind,negative
is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies menstruation circumcision and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them,negative
or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort,negative
either way unbalanced is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort,negative
the premise is catchy widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss has spent the past two years getting over the death of his wife neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses,negative
now its time to show what hes achieved in those two years and he has absolutely nothing to show for it,negative
with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous 100 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonalds,negative
but when his discovery becomes the latest craze among colleagues the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe he must create it,negative
with the aid of his three children the headstrong teen shelly natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you the slightly younger mickey gregory smith and the nineyearold edmund carl michael lindner the shelmikedmu tribe named from the first half of each childs name is born and videos quickly produced in krippendorfs backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe,negative
despite the professors wishes the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows due in greatest part to veronica micelli jenna elfman an overly vivacious and voluptuous anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorfs main assistant,negative
hungry for recognition micelli sets up interviews lectures etc in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history a sure fire way to go down in the history books,negative
krippendorf on the other hand is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor not in history books and with each new lecture he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe mating habits domestic structure etc thru fumbling improvisation and often some quick thinking from his oldest son krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe,negative
on the opposing end is krippendorfs arch rival ruth allen lily tomlin an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the nonexistent tribe,negative
its a cute idea and approached with a more subtle and mature style krippendorfs tribe couldve been a real winner,negative
sadly the mostlymisfired toilet humor overly comical musical score by bruce broughton and sugar coated sentiments all the key ingredients of a family comedy just arent the right tone for this film,negative
cut that crap out add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and youve got a good start,negative
at the state its in now youve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs,negative
doubtfire meets dumb dumber and thats not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try,negative
the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of average with a few laughoutloud moments and a great big gap in between them,negative
most of the characters are surprisingly twodimensional and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort lyonne seems to go greatly unappreciated,negative
director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways,negative
its stuck in limbo between disney family fare jungle 2 jungle and potentially hilarious adult comedy a fish called wanda,negative
its this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade and its a brutal drop,negative
a strong warning to parents forget the impression given by advertisements do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because shes holding his penis,negative
yes its put that bluntly,negative
just be warned this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film and others might not be as tame,negative
capsule the much anticipated readaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence,negative
visually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gullivers travels and treat it as an action film,negative
that makes it a film without much center,negative
0 4 to 4,negative
pierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes a k a monkey planet the novel as a social satire,negative
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gullivers travels,negative
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swifts island of the houyhnhnms,negative
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet,negative
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals but perhaps i was just looking for that,negative
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 he added a number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serlingish,negative
the final irony of the original version has become film history,negative
without it there could never have been a planet of the apes film series,negative
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language,negative
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language,negative
that could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the nonapespeaking,negative
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film,negative
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending,negative
but serling never tackles the allimportant question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language a language they had no opportunity to ever hear,negative
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected in cinema history,negative
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmiths best if not his best,negative
when the films success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added wellintentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s,negative
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the apes there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases,negative
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973,negative
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again,negative
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book burtons new version is even less faithful,negative
first he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes,negative
he has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes,negative
that could be a good story too but it is not planet of the apes,negative
as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring,negative
in 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this worlds most expressive actor works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes,negative
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizardofozfashion and drops him on an alien planet,negative
yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect,negative
he quickly finds not greatly to any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks,negative
and the language they talk is earth english,negative
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that,negative
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didnt occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film,negative
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english,negative
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at humananimal relationships and more one of the masterslave relationships,negative
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic,negative
leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter,negative
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power,negative
she is bent on making the world a better place,negative
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hilari,negative
in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film,negative
she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward,negative
it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes,negative
this is a further abandonment of the source material,negative
the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of eachs place in this reversed society each important in the book,negative
we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down,negative
we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them,negative
burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn,negative
this is a miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in,negative
they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win,negative
the 1968 script had little subtlety with lines like i never met an ape i didnt like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character,negative
most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals,negative
the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog,negative
this tends to limit close looks at the makeup,negative
in general it seems much improved from 1968,negative
the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the 1968 version,negative
in 1968 chambers makeup was a jawdropper,negative
it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion,negative
chambers is good but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker,negative
today audiences have higher expectations bakers visualization is really an improvement,negative
these visuals work nicely,negative
what does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make,negative
they look like they were inspired by the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon,negative
apes spring incredible distances,negative
some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost,negative
one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people closeup,negative
since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy makeup,negative
the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti,negative
it is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes,negative
but he delivers them very well,negative
he was always a watchable actor but has not yet made stardom,negative
as the apetrader limbo he overemotes to overcome his ape makeup but does it very well,negative
in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen,negative
he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinovs performance in spartacus,negative
as an injoke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself,negative
danny elfmans score has a nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmiths 1968 tour de force score is a real classic,negative
that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten,negative
i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
apparently when crap calls jim carrey answers,negative
here he is mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time his second goaround in the role of pet detective ace ventura,negative
that means more talking asscracks penis jokes and cries of alllllllllllrighty then,negative
it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindlers list in terms of dramatic merit or lack of,negative
granted there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of preschool humor but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle,negative
its a painful experience for anyone with a brain,negative
ace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a canyon in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallones cliffhanger jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect or lack of and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness or in his case a level of consciousness,negative
but he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of 20 000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe,negative
why africa,negative
so carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as a tourist family watches look the rhinos about to give birth,negative
if that seems like heehaw humor to you by all means see the movie,negative
if not claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us,negative
obviously there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie like the first ace ventura film i use the word film only because it was filmed not because theres any level of artistic merit a huge success,negative
in fact carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture,negative
you may say to me but andrew look at jerry lewis,negative
he was born with a negative i q,negative
and look how popular he was thirty years ago,negative
maybe but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a mans testicles,negative
lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over,negative
there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been,negative
the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 where a onetime cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets fists stuffed into coat pockets,negative
to one side of him residents scavenge for food in the street to the other side german troops beat a group of jews,negative
jakob however never stops moving,negative
its an efficient effective setup for the character who is clearly nobodys idea of a hero at the outset,negative
he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them excising his moral peripheral vision,negative
the setup is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior,negative
after a visit to a german commandants office and a moment alone with a turnedon radio jakob learns that russian troops are quite near,negative
when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews they become convinced that he must have a radio which is a punishable offense in the ghetto,negative
the good news brings hope to the ghetto the everyday specter of suicide vanishes,negative
a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive,negative
this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting the ordinary person in question jakob heym is played by robin williams,negative
i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his serious roles with every passing year,negative
compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams and see how much more mannered he has become or at the very least how much less sensible at choosing material,negative
jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions but williams always looks like hes struggling not to craft them,negative
when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10yearold orphan lina hannah taylor gordon he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky,negative
oh yes and then theres that little girl,negative
some viewers will undoubtedly consider the heros fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful but those scenes arent problematic because theyre familiar,negative
theyre problematic because theyre jarring and distracting introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldnt have been about cutesy relationships,negative
jakobs character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others but there are plenty of others without poor little lina,negative
every scene with her feels contrived pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people,negative
it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywoodized holocaust combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways,negative
director peter kassovitz working from jurek beckers novel crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople and draws solid performances from armin muellerstahl as a oncerevered doctor and bob balaban as a barber drifting into depression,negative
there are just too many things going on that prove distracting whether its the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter or williams incongrous presence or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl,negative
jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling and has too compelling a central character to waste,negative
and after one wonderful early scene you can see the film wasted and fumbled away,negative
well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you,negative
because thats all that there really is,negative
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot,negative
for one thing a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity,negative
i am not saying that this isnt possible,negative
but it does leave one to wonder i,negative
know i did,negative
another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out,negative
and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations,negative
there was one scene that should have been short,negative
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking,negative
ok enough already get on with it,negative
there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do,negative
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort,negative
another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning,negative
this movie is also very predictable,negative
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment,negative
granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you,negative
also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated,negative
it gets boring at times to tell you the truth,negative
even though there is still action going on,negative
another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero,negative
some of the characters are not proper for their roles,negative
the acting is fine but the characters just dont seem to add up,negative
if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldnt rate this movie too highly but thats just the thing this movie isnt just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done,negative
the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie,negative
the special effects are just amazing you cant tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldnt be able to say that the creature wasnt there during filming extinct or not,negative
another thing is the destruction scenes,negative
wow those were masterpieces,negative
well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dinos make this one of the reasons to see this movie,negative
this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office,negative
unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do,negative
i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments,negative
go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me,negative
one little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly,negative
and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance,negative
you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made,negative
i thought id put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick,negative
its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this,negative
a movie laced with a good blend of action comedy and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product,negative
eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed minus half of its original duo the late john belushi and nearly all of its original charm,negative
dan aykroyd reprises his role as well as his cowriting credit as elwood blues the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a selfproclaimed mission from god along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago,negative
as we begin elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brothers death in prison years ago,negative
completely on his own elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away,negative
but elwood isnt completely without family,negative
it seems he has a halfbrother of sorts not a real brother mind you just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudofather curtis cab calloway from the first film who has also passed on,negative
despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata kathleen freeman to do otherwise elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band,negative
working as a police commander cabel chamberlain joe morton has an immediate disliking for elwood who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mothers affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet,negative
following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster j,negative
evan bonifant who quickly learns to become a minielwood,negative
when bartender mighty mack mcteer john goodman joins the group the blues brothers band is complete and once again the group travels the country crashing cars blowing things up and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock,negative
meanwhile cabs personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his nexttonextofkin,negative
from this point the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between,negative
those hoping for an interesting funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story,negative
only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours,negative
for those people it may be worth it for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting but when the story does intrude upon the festivities the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes musicians turned stiff actors and the pointless 10year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing,negative
appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin james brown eric clapton and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors,negative
blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really really love this kind of music you might kind of sort of like this movie,negative
many many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny and if you dont have a passion for very deep youll be bored out of your skull,negative
much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyds selfserving vanity project but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this none of the excitement is passed on to the audience,negative
and seeing three guys in threepiece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long,negative
unfortunately those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film,negative
around the end of 1998 a japanese cartoon came to the usa television and really wasnt that big,negative
in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time,negative
in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon the first movie which for what it was wasnt all that bad,negative
it grossed 31 million in its opening weekend and went on to make almost 90 million,negative
fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze pokemon the movie 2000 which is far inferior to the original animated movie,negative
first up is the plot which there really isnt much of in fact the plot what there is a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon lugia is about it except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever,negative
well there you go of course ash is followed by his friends misty brock gary and his pokemon friends pikachu squirtle charizard the usual,negative
even though the first movie wasnt a great film it was definately an enjoyable wellmade movie with an actual thin storyline,negative
this new movie however is nothing but garbage there is nothing good to it storywise and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors,negative
compared to the first film this movie is awfully bland from its opening titles to the end titles it tries its best to work but fails miserably at every corner,negative
the characters are 1dimensional the story thin as chicken broth and the writing very lame,negative
even the so called action scenes are extremely lame and falls before it even gets a chance to go,negative
the voices even arent that good and almost feels like the stars dont want to be there like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie,negative
which it certainly is,negative
the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation although not up to disney standards it is still very good with some interesting cgis and very colorful animation the colors jump out at you very fast and seem very nicely put on film,negative
why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash,negative
for now watch the first one,negative
its much much better,negative
miramax disinvited online media from press screenings of scream 3,negative
they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoilerfilled reviews and post them prior to the films february 4th release dateunsound reasoning,negative
you see net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionalsmiramax surely knows the difference between a member of the online film critics society ofcs and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at aint it cool news,negative
no the mini major was afraid wed let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved by this writer at least franchise,negative
something smells rotten in the state of california right from the getgo cotton weary liev schrieber the former lover and wouldbe killer of maureen prescott sidneys mother is juggling phone calls in his luxury car,negative
once considered a danger to society weary now hosts his own talk show 100 cotton a clever if dated jab at american pop culture,negative
of course a new ghostface dials him up and with memories of screams unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind we immediately wonder where is the killer,negative
the backseat,negative
the next car,negative
thrilling prospects to be sure but actually ghostface is at the weary residence waiting for cottons girlfriend kelly rutheford to finishing showering,negative
whats missing from this sequence and indeed scream 3s remaining frights most disappointingly the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes one of which might spring to life is an elaborate and attenuated payoff,negative
our other surviving regulars have become estranged,negative
sidney campbell is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and passwordprotected locks while dewey arquette acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2s moviewithinamovie stab 3 and gale weathers cox arquette headlines a gossipy news program,negative
murder reunites them as knifewielding ghostface stalks the set of stab 3 imitating its sadistic screenplayand their own personal draft climaxes with sidneys death,negative
the appeal of ghostfaces villainy is that they could be your boyfriend your classmate your next door neighbour or a combination of people,negative
scream was the first of its kind a slasher mystery with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next but also who the perpetrator s and what their motive,negative
ironic selfreflection aside parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because theres at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume,negative
with scream 3 the novelty of ghostfaces evermutating identity has worn off some but the character remains conceptually potent,negative
conceptually the execution of ghostfaces master plan this time around is creaky because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what wed come to understand in scream and scream 2 the movie gets in the silly habit of saying all bets are off,negative
in reference to the rules of a trilogys third act but theres a difference between rule breaking and cheating,negative
with the departure of kevin williamson who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 that for reasons incomprehensible to me was ignored save the notion of stab 3 kruger needed to be reined in tighter and by wes craven,negative
cravens direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects,negative
how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo the slacker duo of kevin smith movies akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny,negative
it pains me to write this but scream 3s comedy is generally laughless with the exception of welltimed performances by josh pais as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in cravens music of the heart jamie kennedy resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 and parker posey through sheer force of will as a bactress,negative
the visuals are much weaker in part three as wellthe occasional sweeping gesture of peter demings camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before,negative
aside in the wake of columbine craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3why the sanctimony when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves,negative
finally marco beltramis music cues the suspense too blatantlydo you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 its mostly silent,negative
sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere here they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nervejangling score,negative
i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iiiwoefully out of synch with its prequels scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs,negative
the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t part three must disappoint,negative
young einstein is embarrassingly lame but that didnt stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia where it became the third largest box office hit of all time,negative
in the u s warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan inxs and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under,negative
personally im hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb,negative
young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious who not only wrote produced edited and directed the film but also starred and did his own stunts,negative
his creation is about as stupid and contrived as youd expect from someone named yahoo,negative
the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einsteins youth,negative
whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania a remote australian island,negative
in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity albert invents surfing bubbles in beer and the electric guitar,negative
yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hicka clown with an insatiable curiosity,negative
although yahoos performance is at first endearing the onedimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say emc2,negative
yahoo has created a charming family for albert and the scenes on tasmania are often clever,negative
but after the first twenty minutes the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy,negative
young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot,negative
yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack unfortunately the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing,negative
almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video,negative
the instrumental score on the other hand is generally playful yahoo uses such classics as the 1812 overture and the theme from the good the bad and the ugly to great comic effect,negative
halfway through young einstein i knew for sure the movie was a stinker,negative
but it wasnt until the very end that i finally put my finger on why the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies such as young sherlock holmes but from cheesy primetime sitcoms,negative
in fact young einstein might have been more at home on network television where its sophomoric humor wouldnt raise any eyebrows,negative
ah and 1999 was going along so well too,negative
shes all that has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie ive seen so far this year,negative
and quite frankly i doubt ill see anything equally bad,negative
at least i hope i dont see anything equally bad,negative
shes all that tells the story of the most popular guy in school played by freddie prinze jr who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school rachel leigh cook into the most popular,negative
that right there is problem 1,negative
how many times have we seen this storyline,negative
as cook comments near the end of the film its kind of like pretty woman except without the prostitution,negative
of course had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material the wellworn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward,negative
as it is though shes all that relies completely on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead,negative
theres not one original or interesting character in the film either and if that wasnt bad enough theres not one good performance featured,negative
the star of the movie rachel leigh cook is simply horrible,negative
i usually dont like to get so personal but in this case i think it needs to be said,negative
cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was,negative
i was never convinced that she was a nerd and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary,negative
the movie seems to be saying its better to be popular than to be who you are,negative
as for freddie prinze jr an actor i ordinarily enjoy he too is quite bad here,negative
he coasts through the film on socalled charm and never establishes a real character,negative
kieren culkin is here too as the brother of cook,negative
and for some indiscernable reason hes got hearing aids,negative
no explanation is given and theyre never brought up,negative
were we supposed to feel sorry for him just because he wore hearing aids,negative
i dont think so,negative
that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things ive seen in a movie in a long time,negative
shes all that sucks,negative
thats what it boils down to,negative
its not entertaining and its not even a good time passer,negative
the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hairremoval system informercial,negative
and whats worse it sends out a bad message to teens,negative
it appears to be telling them hey it doesnt matter if youre happy the way you are,negative
thats unimportant,negative
if you want to truly be happy dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubbleheaded moron,negative
ugh,negative
tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while,negative
not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid,negative
unfortunately its not bad in the way great colossal misfires like heavens gate 1980 or ishtar 1987 were bad,negative
instead it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it was made in the first place,negative
with all the good scripts lying around hollywood unproduced how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen,negative
of course tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history he has appeared in over forty films which have ranged from the very good 1984s greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes down to the really bad 1981s tarzan the ape man with bo derek,negative
most of these films were just cheapie bmovies made in the thirties and forties starring exolympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps,negative
therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others,negative
greystoke added a neverbeforeseen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the misguided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo dereks bare breasts,negative
tarzan and the lost city on the other hand has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue,negative
the script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come,negative
comic books have better plots than this,negative
the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summers comedy george of the jungle,negative
didnt the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs,negative
the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tells of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage,negative
when the movie starts in 1913 he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week,negative
however when a wicked robber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africas last great secrets the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle,negative
at first jane refuses to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her apeman,negative
once the film gets going in its own sluggish way it delves into a series of jungle adventures as tarzan jane and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city,negative
most of the socalled adventures are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of,negative
there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies ranging from raiders of the lost ark 1981 to the goonies 1985,negative
when the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeacefriendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusks into the river,negative
the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality,negative
for instance when tarzan who was raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesnt even attempt to suck the venom out like any semiexperienced weekend backpacker would do,negative
instead he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival,negative
of course one cant help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is,negative
not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city,negative
there is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up with the special effects are not worthy of a madefortv movie,negative
which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid when its sitting right out in the middle of an open field,negative
strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isnt even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close,negative
this movie proves what starship troopers only hinted at he cannot act but he sure looks wellgroomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle,negative
van dien is much too much of a prettyboy to be an effective tarzan hes a calvin klein model in a loin cloth,negative
i also wondered what the makeup department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa1983 steve perry haircut,negative
waddington makes a decent villain although hes like a charmless version of belloq from raiders of the lost ark as jane the exmodel jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan,negative
she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two but whenever a snake comes into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess,negative
however amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news,negative
tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in ideas both new and old that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid,negative
so we can say this much for it at least it had the decency to be short,negative
some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning a liveaction version of mr,negative
magoo being a prime example,negative
the cartoon figure mr magoo the bumbling blind man can be quite funny but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images,negative
if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls you are right but there is an even more astonishing selection,negative
for a director they tapped hong kongs stanley tong whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan,negative
the story such that there is one is about a large stolen ruby which looks a woolworth reject,negative
mr magoo gets it and of course does not realize he has it,negative
mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased,negative
like home alone 3 but without any class mr,negative
magoo can only be described as painfully bad,negative
fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity,negative
the movies humor is pathetically lame and the pacing is way off,negative
when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture one looks for some solace,negative
mr,negative
magoo provides only three such moments,negative
the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character who exudes his usual charm,negative
the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus the sweet little bulldog,negative
angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture,negative
finally the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked,negative
rather than attempt to adapt mr magoo to a noncartoon movie nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon,negative
he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny,negative
my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie but i was not so lucky,negative
hopefully this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not,negative
mr magoo runs 1 37,negative
it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages,negative
my son jeffrey age 8 said he thought the movie was good and really funny but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie,negative
he said he liked home alone 3 much more,negative
his friend maxim age 9 said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense,negative
his other friend nickolas age 8 said hed give the movie 12 but that it was really silly,negative
the catch phrase for disneys rocket man is one spoken by fred z randall harland williams the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes,negative
it wasnt me he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others,negative
well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is williams cant take all the blame but he sure cant justify himself with his own simple tag line either,negative
fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wideeyed at a poster of the earth,negative
as a 30yearold fred hasnt grown up much but at least hes somewhat closer to his goal now designing astronaut software for nasa,negative
when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void,negative
fred,negative
yes although hes an obviously klutzy moron nasa doesnt think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program and time itself has ever known,negative
for the first part of the film we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park he laughs he screams but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than childs play,negative
his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recordbreaking feats much to the dismay of cocky counterpart mission commander captain overbeck william sadler who once held the records,negative
overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet one being astronaut julie ford the stupids jessica lundy and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist,negative
from here on out we are subjected to one lame gag after another dealing with snot laxatives and flatulence,negative
you know standard kid movie material,negative
almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist williams is awful in his first starring role,negative
we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and peewee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring williams would be it,negative
while hes not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany stupid comedy hes just as unlikeable,negative
to say it more understandably jim carrey might annoy you more but this guy is even less funny,negative
why,negative
because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role his performance is too understated and boring,negative
classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy,negative
stan laurel for example was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him,negative
peter sellers as inspector clouseau was so selfassured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip it was humor at its best,negative
williams on the other hand cant garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his antiglory,negative
as for the rest of the cast including some bigger names in smaller roles beau bridges and shelley duvall nobody is worth watching whatsoever,negative
this is just another example of the fastfood equivalent of cinema massproduced less than mediocre over priced and hard to stomach,negative
giving it oneandahalf stars is extremely generous but even ill admit to laughing a few times,negative
the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids laughter was something rarely heard even from the children,negative
i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didnt crack up over every little thing,negative
then again maybe they were asleep,negative
some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies claiming adults arent the targeted audience and therefore arent meant to and wont enjoy them,negative
sadly its also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if its presented right,negative
a twohour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast which could easily do the same thing,negative
and saying that a parents perspective isnt important is quite a poor theory to have when theyre the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place,negative
i think that saying that the xfiles is one of this summers most anticipated films is safe,negative
for five years the xfiles television show has developed a dedicated fan culture whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of star trek fans,negative
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal fox mulder david duchovny is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid and dana scully gillian anderson is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulders flights of fancy,negative
outlining the plot of the xfiles movie is virtually impossible since to be general would result in confusion yet to be specific would give too much away,negative
nevertheless i will try,negative
the black ooze and extraterrestrial viruslike substance is threatening earth,negative
a shadow government is aware of this but tries to coverup the alien existence,negative
mulder and scully know the truth is out there and so try to expose both the invasion and the coverup,negative
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie 1,negative
will those who dont watch the series be able to understand the movie,negative
yes,negative
isolated as an individual text the xfiles can stand alone,negative
they have given enough background for anyone familiar with the show or not to understand the movie,negative
although some of the secondary characters histories may confuse the uninitiated those characters are not essential to the film,negative
this is a major problem they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly,negative
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee,negative
why bring in the lone gunmen three computer geek conspiracy theorists for an even briefer appearance,negative
these characters are recurrent on the series and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience suggesting their popularity among fans actually most of the audience could pass for the lone gunmen,negative
still then they vanish just as quickly,negative
2 the television show never gives us any answers,negative
will the movie actually explain some things,negative
yes,negative
in the xfiles we get a fairly complete history of the black ooze what it is and what it wants,negative
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the shadow government,negative
there are even some subtle tieins with contemporary ufoology including the greys and the roswell crash of 1947,negative
3 is the movie any good,negative
no the xfiles is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with chris carters talents and the relationship between cinema and television,negative
first off the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched,negative
after approximately fortyfive minutes the length of a television episode minus the commercials the pace drops to a snails crawl,negative
not long after that point when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series we wish he had not,negative
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much,negative
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much,negative
breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie and listening to other fans leave the cinema maybe the series too,negative
the explanations are not only absurd they are tired and unoriginal,negative
the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day,negative
note that the alien movies id4 and the xfiles are all from 20thcentury fox a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think,negative
the xfiles is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running,negative
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge,negative
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people,negative
however i rather liked that about the series,negative
television allows you to impose as much or as little meaning on a show as you want,negative
it is the proverbial blank screen which we project our minds on,negative
meaning on television is open and ambiguous it is the nature of the medium,negative
cinema on the other hand is the opposite,negative
it projects onto us the filmmakers mind,negative
we can in some films fill the textual gaps ourselves but that almost never happens in an american film,negative
meaning in cinema needs to be selfcontained and determined,negative
so when the xfiles made that jump from small to big screen carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well,negative
he did not,negative
by making explicit what the television show left implicit carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill,negative
when they say that fans make a tv show it is not far from the truth,negative
on television fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there,negative
how true that is when we see the explicit xfiles there is nothing there,negative

how true that is when we see the explicit xfiles there is nothing there,negative
annie wilson cate blanchett a widow who struggles to raise her children in a small town in georgia is asked for help by local authorities in solving the case of a missing woman,negative
annie is something of a psychic she has involuntary bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions,negative
her gift leads to the arrest of a nasty wife beater who may or may not have killed the pretty rich girl found in the swamp on his property,negative
in an ultra conservative backwoods town will her testimony based on her psychic visions hold up in court,negative
do they even have the right man,negative
whats good about it,negative
aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale there is little else going for the film,negative
whats not so good about it,negative
lame unoriginal screenplay,negative
predictable ending,negative
suspense scenes that are just plain boring,negative
ridicously trite characterization makes the entire south out to be ingnorant hateful goobers,negative
relentless in its emotional sensationaliztion,negative
overall critique,negative
the gift is one of those movies that makes you wonder where youve seen this story before,negative
its a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the south ever made and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south thats really saying something,negative
for an established talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film,negative
its predictable from the first scene the screenplay is written like a ripoff of a photocopied bootlegged play,negative
you know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didnt actually do it,negative
its no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was,negative
sigh how trite,negative
for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because its so cliche,negative
the gift is basically a glorified bmovie,negative
pokemon 3 the movie has a lot of bad things in it,negative
first of all its a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents badly written script and fantastic animation,negative
the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost 90 million domestically,negative
a sequel soon followed and even made 45 million,negative
warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid,negative
this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles which my little brother told me the new spinoff is pokemon the johto journeys so go figure anyway he comes in contact with a young girl whos father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown,negative
they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities,negative
the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young mollys house and creates every wish she wants,negative
now its up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one,negative
too bad really that this is a bad movie surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between,negative
it has some good qualities animation message in the end but the flaws seem to overpower the goods,negative
im still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language besides meowth my personal favorite and you dont understand what they are saying,negative
my little brother just thought the movie was amazing and i kept leaning over and asking him happened or what pokemon that was,negative
his response was a big lecture of how this is that and that is this he,negative
sure did put me in my place,negative
with the second and third movie being bad i have a feeling pokemon 4 the movie might be a total bust as well,negative
pokemon 3 the movie has some redeeming qualities for the kids and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film,negative
for those parents brothers and sisters who have to sit through this bring a pillow,negative
it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon when the only good things on tv are the secondrate movies they show some are good they showed total recall before this one,negative
if you know me i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live,negative
and this includes keanu reeves,negative
what do i hate about seagal,negative
i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and nonthreatening situation the squint,negative
i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around bullying people up saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynolds hairpiece in boogie nights,negative
i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights,negative
i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain,negative
i hate his nonsatirical messages in the beginning of this one he slaps on a quote from arthur miller which has nothing to do with the film except its about brooklyn where this film takes place,negative
and i hate how hes so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing during the end credits he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him,negative
sure the guys probably a nice guy in person i actually found him very nonthreatening when he was on letterman not too long ago,negative
but the guy makes worse films than reagan did,negative
so whats the plot of this shitterpiece,negative
well something,negative
about him trying to catch a stupidass crook william forsythe who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight,negative
i couldnt believe how bad this scene was the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ahem,negative
and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off,negative
im sorry did anyone ever hear of concealing ones self,negative
so in comes exbrooklynite seagal who dedicates his life to catching this guy,negative
and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning then ended the film,negative
but noooo this drags on as he bullies forsythes family members including a stupid barowner and none other than gina gershon as his other barowner sister,negative
and forsythe more than once threatens his family,negative
at one point he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a nonthreatening nicholson in the shining complete with them all hiding in the bathroom but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away,negative
seagal paints himself as a lovable person with a son and a fiancee,negative
he even shows him hanging with his son checking up on his homework and then about to take him out for a bit of catch when hes conveniently called away on assignment,negative
i dunno about you but playing catch with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares,negative
he also shows him as that badass he wants to be with scenes of him bullying crooks around and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after hes unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue,negative
serves them right,negative
this film as some of his do has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented but dont appear to be in this film,negative
i already mentioned gina gershon whos pretty horrible in this one as well as william forsythe who overacts terribly,negative
i know this guy can act he was awesome in raising arizona as goodmans partner in crime,negative
but hes just awful here,negative
jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down,negative
why is he the only one who gives a good performance,negative
well because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility,negative
he seems to be in here just to give it a cool law and order feeling even if its not a cool feeling,negative
and in cameos are brated eroticthrillercinemaxstyle stars shannon whirry as terry malloy which is more of a bad joke than a clever one and athena massey,negative
oh,negative
and er s julliana margiulles has two scenes,negative
out for justice just proves once again that american action films just suck,negative
i know that theres such a good thing as good action hes called john woo,negative
but if youre in the mood for some good old nobrainer funyetdumb action dont bother watching this,negative
its so stupid that its boring,negative
im giving this stinker,negative
normally the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be,negative
but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come to the big goose egg,negative
im not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all,negative
maybe in mels little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny,negative
in mine its not,negative
or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking,negative
because only the selfrighteous lee uses the nword more often in his films than brooks did in this one,negative
at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing,negative
brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it,negative
wrong mel,negative
i would call you a boob mel but that insults breasts everywhere,negative
this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governors harvey korman attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad,negative
he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out,negative
but the town appeals to the governor mel brooks in one of many uninspired and unfunny roles to send them a new sheriff to protect them,negative
the governor pawns the task off to kormans character hedley lamarr,negative
i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name,negative
lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff gasp in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave,negative
hold on ive got to stop while these gales of laughter pass,negative
its just too funny,negative
racism passing as humor gosh why didnt anybody ever think of that one before,negative
oh wait i think somebody might have they are called the kkk,negative
im not calling brooks a racist but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldnt know what was funny if it hit him over the head,negative
but i digress,negative
anyway the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the nword,negative
golly will the hilarity just never end,negative
he ends up joining forces with a drunk gene wilder who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west,negative
together they save the day from evil,negative
not one person in this movie gives a decent performance,negative
wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie,negative
ok he really didnt but he should have,negative
the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day,negative
i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience,negative
i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions,negative
actually the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise but alas it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie,negative
i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,negative
mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film,negative
arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late 80s but lately his films have been very sloppy and the oneliners are getting worse,negative
its hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got 15 million whats it matter to him,negative
once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster that cant compare with the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser,negative
in this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth to impregnate a woman robin tunney which happens every 1000 years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself,negative
with the help of a trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world,negative
parts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in with dogma,negative
yes the film is that weak but its better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film,negative
anyway this definitely doesnt seem like an arnold movie,negative
it just wasnt the type of film you can see him doing,negative
sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known oneliners but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going,negative
its understandable especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources,negative
aside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films,negative
im sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days,negative
speaking of action where was it in this film,negative
there was hardly any explosions or fights,negative
the devil made a few places explode but arnold wasnt kicking some devil butt,negative
the ending was changed to make it more spiritual which undoubtedly ruined the film,negative
i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again i was let down,negative
i also dont know why the film took so long and cost so much,negative
there was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for 5 minutes tops worth the overpriced budget,negative
the budget should have gone into a better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom,negative
its pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie,negative
do they even read these things anymore,negative
it sure doesnt seem like it,negative
thankfully gabriels performance gave some light to this poor film,negative
when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you cant help but feel that he looked like a devil,negative
the guy is creepy looking anyway,negative
when its all over youre just glad its the end of the movie,negative
dont bother to see this if youre expecting a solid action flick because its neither solid nor does it have action,negative
its just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing due to a strategic marketing campaign,negative
save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience,negative
america loves convenience,negative
after all were the culture that invented the cell phone the 24hour atm and my most beloved the remote control,negative
yet perhaps this time with ghosts of mars we have taken our love of convenience to far,negative
ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails pillpoppin martian cop sent with her squadron to retrieve demolition williams ice cube from a remote mining town for trial back home,negative
when she and her comrades appropriately dubbed the commander the rookies and the guy with the cool accent discover the towns residents slaughtered they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents headchopping alienpossessed clutches,negative
filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks flashessideways and viewpoint changes ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and illconceived action sequences,negative
the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story,negative
ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose,negative
attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced,negative
most of these moments come off as kwikemart wisdom dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the eventempered streetwise hand of ice cube,negative
with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other cube reminisces about his street life comparing the zombiestomping fun to me and my brother when we was kids,negative
apparently crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment,negative
but even in the films darkest moments fate conveniently lends a hand supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite,negative
yes in the future man may travel to space and conquer mars but nothing beats a good stick of tnt,negative
and as we all know every police station past present or future keeps a healthy supply on hand,negative
characters die heads are lopped off but they were only supporting roles anyway so why should we care,negative
as long as you have plenty of narcotics immunity is guaranteed,negative
eventually though even the most welltrained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson,negative
what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation killing anything the machine guns cant handle,negative
explosions are fun,negative
and even if the nukes dont get them the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will,negative
in the end this film defines itself when our cops tribunal pronounces is that all you have to tell us,negative
for indeed john carpenter has run out of things to say and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story,negative
i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard,negative
the problem is i cant remember them as i write this review,negative
thats not a good sign,negative
in booty call jamie foxx is bunz a character whom i cant really describe because i dont know that much about him,negative
i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk and that he doesnt like relationships just booty calls at three in the morning no questions no commitment,negative
bunz has a best friend named rushon tommy davidson who seems to be bunzs direct opposite on the straight and narrow and currently in a longterm commitment a whole seven weeks wow,negative
rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend nikki tamala jones but for a reason which is not totally explained its going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikkis friend lysterine vivica a fox who have never met,negative
to make a long story short the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikkis obsession with safe sex,negative
first she wants condoms so bunz and rushon go out and get them,negative
oh no they have to be latex not lambskin,negative
back to the store,negative
now theyve got to get dental dams or therell be no foreplay,negative
why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand,negative
nikki phones lysterine who lives across the hall and tells her shed better be making these demands too,negative
talk about coitus interruptus,negative
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies,negative
the difference between the two is that in the latter things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality,negative
in this category for example you have ace ventura private eye on the mild side and airplane,negative
at the extreme,negative
there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention,negative
it is disappointing and even worse distracting,negative
there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker are those real names,negative
does not live up to its potential as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing,negative
for instance there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant,negative
bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese much to everyones surprise,negative
however when asked how he learned the language he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films and soon gained mastery,negative
this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene,negative
if on the other hand when asked how he learned to speak chinese bunz simply replied with kungfu movies and then moved on the joke would have been much more effective,negative
this is because it would have been totally unbelievable but funny because we know it is unbelievable,negative
by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible the film is not giving its viewers enough credit,negative
the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions,negative
why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends,negative
why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine,negative
if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex why doesnt she have some condoms at her own apartment,negative
these questions are not answered by the screenplay but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward,negative
a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language,negative
some movies use a lot of swear words but use them under very justifiable circumstances as when they are employed consistent with a characters pattern of speech,negative
other films such as the recent jackie brown use them in ways that almost parody themselves,negative
booty call just sticks them in to get laughs and it doesnt work,negative
they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them,negative
half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason,negative
the chinese restaurant a holdup at a convenience store and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story and are in there for filler,negative
this is surprising considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long,negative
its too bad that the core of the film isnt much better since it is comprised of sometimes funny but forgettable dialog,negative
i refer you to the first paragraph of this review,negative
edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is a workingclass relationship picture,negative
however unlike his previous work the film dwells on a more personal story and with a female protagonist,negative
and in no looking back he stumbles making a slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work,negative
claudia lauren holly is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life,negative
shes at a turning point in her life and feels as if shes going nowhere,negative
her boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in a dead end job,negative
if she were to marry him shed never get a chance to escape this town,negative
enter charlie edward burns claudias old flame,negative
he skipped town several years before without any explanations even,negative
for claudia,negative
he has come back to town to see her and suddenly she is torn,negative
should she stay with stable michael and never escape her hometown or,negative
should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again,negative
part of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudias father to return,negative
now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes,negative
at only a little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre,negative
unfortunately it seems much much longer,negative
the storyline is simple and uninspired and theres a lack of energy to the whole proceedings which makes the entire drama rather tedious,negative
edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame,negative
theres no one to restrain his ego which reigns unchecked,negative
he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah,negative
right,negative
lauren holly does what she can with her central character,negative
but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and,negative
we never really care,negative
bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie,negative
his acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with,negative
theres not much to recommend in no looking back,negative
its not that the film is bad its,negative
simply boring,negative
theres no zest in any aspect of the film and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it,negative
while i am not fond of any writers use of cheap easy puns i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it witness my review of pecker from a couple of issues ago,negative
so here goes the juvenile collegeset black comedy deadmanoncampus is dead on arrival,negative
straitlaced med student josh tom everett scott who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout s blemishfree academic record breaks out into fs thanks to the influence of his everpartying roommate cooper markpaul gosselaar who introduces josh to the sex and boozefilled nights that come with university life,negative
with the threat of losing an academic scholarship josh and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming cooper what are two goodhearted slackers to do,negative
easylook for a loophole which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a students or students roommate commits suicide the surviving student s shall receive straight as,negative
so instead of studying josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there move him into their dorm room and drive him to suicide before the semester ends,negative
director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and coopers diabolical plot,negative
until then the usual boring cliches of college life booze sex more booze fill the time which is made to feel longer by savedbythebell alumnus gosselaars sitcombred mugging,negative
that said once cohn and company do build some comic momentum they mishandle it,negative
the introduction of the manic psychotic cliff lochlyn munro a potential roommate for josh and cooper brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates paranoid nerd buckley randy pearlstein and british death rocker matt corey page,negative
one wishes that cliff would reappear but as they say be careful what you wish for,negative
not surprisingly he does resurface and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose almost immediately his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty,negative
the same can be said about all of deadmanoncampus,negative
whatever morbid appeal the farfetched premise has quickly evaporates and the selfabsorbed characters especially cooper pretty much grate from the getgo,negative
deadman doesnt grow tiresome it already is once the clever opening titles are through,negative
as it slogs along to a cheesy happyforallparties conclusion deadman lives up to its title and then somenot only does the movie grow even more tired and die it still insists on going on,negative
like a zombie,negative
i admit it,negative
i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies,negative
watching him in jingle all the way i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids,negative
it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg13 kindergarten cop but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence alcohol consumption burglary racism and child molestation,negative
and you know theyll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santas elves,negative
he later decks a reindeer,negative
hey man why dont you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while youre at it,negative
jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass it must be funny school of thought,negative
arnold sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene,negative
what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents cant find a rare toy on christmas eve and will do anything to get one,negative
arnold is of course one of the parents a crack salesman who is never there for his son,negative
he races from the office to his sons karate game only to find out he missed it,negative
and his kid distrusts him because hes never around,negative
gee we havent seen that in a movie before,negative
arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his sons affection is to get him a turboman doll which his wife rita wilson who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this told him to get weeks ago,negative
so arnold sets out to find a turboman which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out,negative
let me back up for a minute here arnolds kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character which is unhealthy beyond belief,negative
watches the show eats the cereal sleeps on the freakin turboman sheets,negative
id try to discourage any further obsession myself lest any kid seeing this movie think its a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want,negative
but nooooo the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son who dont recognize him until the last minute,negative
this is a sad movie all the way through but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa jim belushi who runs a bootleg toy factory,negative
most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay an embarrassed martin mull who said he was giving away a turboman doll,negative
capitalism has produced some pretty evil things chia pets but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful,negative
never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping your cookies are incredible its the main plot of the movie that sends the message that its okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want,negative
maybe thats what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house but not at mine,negative
i still cant figure out why people went in droves to see this movie,negative
now before you go assuming im some sort of high brow snob who cant appreciate a little dumb humor let me say that i love cheap humor,negative
i thought theres something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998,negative
low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent there is no humor component,negative
i wanted to like the waterboy i really did,negative
i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie,negative
actually i smiled a couple of more times on top of that,negative
not a great record for a 90minute film,negative
the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies,negative
those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material,negative
nothing could be further from the truth as matter of fact sandlers idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film,negative
its really a shame too because this film had the potential to be very funny,negative
i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian its just that so far he hasnt been able to find the right film to showcase his talents,negative
if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live,negative
most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry,negative
sandler plays a 31yearold somewhat mentally challenged waterboy for a college football team,negative
the teams somewhat mentally disturbed coach henry winkler realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pentup rage which if harnessed properly would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field,negative
you can figure out the rest from here,negative
sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star,negative
as i said the film had a great deal of potential,negative
the idea was a decent one but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast,negative
all of whom are very good just hamstrung by really really lousy material,negative
even sandler annoying goofy voice and all has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material,negative
even as unfunny as his character is i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film,negative
but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about,negative
if their material had been just a bit better this film could have been such a funny movie,negative
fairuza balk plays sandlers leatherwearing bikerchick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time,negative
winkler is great as the coach who uses a coaching for dummies style book to help him get through games,negative
the real standout though is kathy bates,negative
even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandlers overprotective and overbearing mama,negative
even with the performances of bates and winkler there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie,negative
although i get the distinct impression that without them this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me,negative
which is sad because i cant really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became,negative
its obvious that those involved specifically the actors tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie,negative
its just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat,negative
whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask,negative
i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired followup as well as the even numbered entries in the film series,negative
however i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs data,negative
somewhere along the line the star trek film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category and star trek generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction,negative
its production values may be high but the writing is frequently appalling and instead of a script has a collection of references injokes and illdefined characters,negative
generations opens in the late 23rd century where members of the original enterprise crew including captain james t kirk william shatner are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name,negative
no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus a mysterious ribbon of energy,negative
among those rescued from the nexus is longlived alien dr soran malcolm mcdowell but he is nonetoopleased at being back in the real world,negative
seventyeight years later soran is still trying to get back to the nexus and again encounters an enterprise this one led by captain jeanluc picard patrick stewart,negative
sorans plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains,negative
i dont think it is an insult to fans of star trek to suggest that to a certain extent the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a trek film,negative
its about a chance to visit with old friends and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy,negative
but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent and in generations that just doesnt happen,negative
data brent spiner is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing,negative
in the films major subplot data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions a chip he has had in his possession for over a year,negative
what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step,negative
he doesnt get a joke,negative
once the chip is in place spiner gets to have a lot of fun with datas new emotions but the point is that hes no longer the data we know,negative
if the rest of the next generation cast fares any better its only because theyre on the screen so little that theyre simply window dressing,negative
but then again this story isnt really about the new crew,negative
its about kirk and picard the cowboy and the politician sharing the screen,negative
the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away,negative
perhaps because he knows this is his last goround in the part that made him a legend shatner looks like hes having the time of his life stewart on the other hand borders on the deferrential and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast,negative
stewarts edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramounts hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was these are clearly the not ready for big screen players,negative
by contrast the prologue which features scotty james doohan and chekhov walter koenig is the highlight of the film,negative
these characters have become part of the popular mythology and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress its a moment of high energy,negative
only thirty years of history can create a moment like that and thats time this new crew doesnt have,negative
it certainly doesnt help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again,negative
its also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition,negative
i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the trek universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on,negative
and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession,negative
there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at but to do so would be to ignore generations major flaws,negative
however i would like to make one recommendation seatbelts,negative
not just for the enterprise crew although youd think by the 24th century space travel wouldnt involve rolling around on the floor during a battle,negative
no i think the audience might need them more,negative
this journey is one bumpy ride,negative
a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings,negative
family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in handwringing detail,negative
still i cant recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love,negative
and after it i still cant,negative
bye bye love is rarely funny more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tvmovie fare,negative
only a few moments which have nothing to do with the films main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion,negative
bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children,negative
dave matthew modine a father of two is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend vic randy quaid is a foulhumored father of three about to go on a rare date donny paul reiser pines for his exwife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma eliza dushku,negative
over the course of the weekend the three men face various crises including vics blind date from hell janeane garofolo and donnys growing estrangement from emma,negative
the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality,negative
randy quaid is the best of the three bitter without being irritating gleefully spiteful without being frightening,negative
his runins with is exwife lindsey crouse are a bit overplayed though and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist rob reiner is gimmicky and implausible,negative
he does get bye bye loves best subplot a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo and he does a great slow burn,negative
paul reiser really has only one character his slightly befuddled uptight nice guy mad about you persona but he does it well,negative
as a personality he is appealing but as a character he becomes pretty boring here,negative
matthew modine is quite simply terrible,negative
this isnt a performance good enough to be called mailedin he even forgot to put a stamp on it,negative
modine lacks any charm in an appallingly underwritten role looks bored most of the time and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how its all his fathers fault hes such a cad,negative
carolcos executives whose entire future is resting on modines bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island must be sweating buckets right now,negative
bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids making it just another dating in the 90s movie,negative
when the movie does deal with the children at all it is to have one of them scream out an accusation cry perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug perhaps not,negative
even more confusing is a subplot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonalds and befriends a troubled youth,negative
it is a sad end to flanders career getting caught up in a truly annoying overuse of mcdonalds as a location a plot device and apparently a major advertiser,negative
even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parentchild relationships it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family breakups and their effects on children,negative
any way you slice it it is a bad situation for kids and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue,negative
it is left to the dads romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is and it isnt enough,negative
there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching,negative
bye bye love is a genuine shame,negative
easely one of the worst films of the year,negative
with the millenium just around the corner hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century,negative
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil,negative
the result is somewhat predictable,negative
i didnt have high hopes about arnolds much anticipated return to the big screen,negative
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased action lovers wont be bored and the catholic league will be angry,negative
everyone else will see end of days for what it is a deliciously bad motion picture,negative
think of it as hollywoods own y2k bug,negative
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 youll get 999 as in 1999,negative
yes you better believe it satan is here on earth working on his latest project the end of days,negative
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and although not al pacino he is fun to behold,negative
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker wreaking as they say havoc,negative
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes,negative
before the stroke of the new millennium hes got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations,negative
only schwarzeneggers cop attached to an antiterrorist unit can stop him,negative
films like this has one serious weakness logic,negative
no matter how you twist the plot youll find it incredibly stupid even for a schwartzenegger movie,negative
the incredible fact is that such directors never learn,negative
after thousands of headless productions this theme has become one big clich,negative
here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution,negative
he is walking around n y blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius,negative
all he wants is the girl that is somehow special,negative
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks he has hidden her in a church where satan dare not enter,negative
so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information you can have your wife and daughter back i,negative
can give you happiness that you can only dream of just,negative
give me the address,negative
indeed with a script like that you could make a wonderful parody but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller,negative
and for you who have awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback will not be very satisfied,negative
weve not seen him in a while,negative
thats because he didnt have a worthy opponent,negative
he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars,negative
he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop,negative
so after all those fights whats left for arnold schwarzenegger,negative
how about satan,negative
in my opinion he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons terminator,negative
and that is schwartzeneggers strength muscles and no emotions,negative
here he tries to achieve an artistic level moving towards the oscar,negative
this is called an adult turn if successful and a flop if unsuccessful,negative
make a wild guess,negative
his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems,negative
this requires at least some acting skills,negative
regrettably the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles,negative
the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters,negative
the movie is otherwise technically impressive with a solid cinematography and fine lighting,negative
but the movie doesnt serve neither as a serious thriller because of its stupidity nor as comic entertainment because of its serious tone,negative
the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry,negative
the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular,negative
so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody,negative
unless you are a diehard schwartzenegger fan stay away,negative
as for schwarzenegger hell be back,negative
mercury rising has numerous flaws but there is one that really stands out its central plot device is unnecessary,negative
thats right,negative
the major aspect of the film that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy action flicks could be dropped from the beginning and the movie would turn out exactly the same if not better,negative
this central device is the fact that a nineyearold boy is autistic,negative
his name is simon and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow alec baldwin wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it,negative
simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent unfair world against his will with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him,negative
the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of mercury rising,negative
i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simons character and his relationship with willis but here it is lost,negative
miko hughes the young actor who plays simon goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic he walks slowly drawls his words kicks and screams when hes touched and has a hard time looking at other people,negative
its a difficult role for an adult much less a young child to play and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isnt playing like hes autistic,negative
unlike dustin hoffmans performance in rain man or leonardo dicaprios in whats eating gilbert grape we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting,negative
however unlike rain man which used its characters autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story mercury rising could go right about its generic predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid,negative
hell he doesnt even have to be shy,negative
in fact the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role rather than just being carted around under willis arm,negative
willis character art jeffries is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything,negative
he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simons house where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide,negative
of course we know that isnt the way it happened happen because we saw an evil squarejawed government hitman with a meanlooking crewcut knock off the parents,negative
simon was able to get away and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked,negative
jeffries who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it knows there is something more and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon,negative
this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simons parents is crawling everywhere attempting to kill simon at the hospital on the highway and every other place he goes,negative
late in the movie jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey kim dickens who he meets at a coffee shop,negative
of all the hardtobelieve aspects of the movie this is the worst,negative
i can believe in the decency of the human heart but staceys character is far too accommodating,negative
not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery she lets him into her apartment at two oclock in the morning when she knows the police is after him and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent,negative
the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point,negative
the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences but even here mercury rising doesnt rise to the challenge,negative
the movie was directed by harold becker who has made some good suspense films including sea of love 1989 and malice 1993 but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion,negative
there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman played by peter stormare that is so ineptly directed shot and edited that i had no idea 1 exactly where they were on the streetcar 2 who was hitting who and 3 where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were,negative
the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building and features a harrowing yawn scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building not because he has to but because its more suspenseful that way,negative
taken as a whole mercury rising is an tepid confused movie that lacks style wit and any traces of a sense of humor,negative
usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles but here he is too straight and serious,negative
this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time but it ends up failing on both fronts,negative
maybe the book was better but the way its handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore,negative
michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels many of which are science fiction,negative
the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel,negative
so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a bigbudget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel,negative
congo failed and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better,negative
it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good,negative
the film is expensive over one hundred million dollars is long 133 minutes has a terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel l jackson and sharon stone but has little that is really original and less that is exciting,negative
several years ago dr norman goodman played by dustin hoffman was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered,negative
the plan he wrote was only semiserious but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien,negative
now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s,negative
suddenly normans less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft,negative
included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams samuel l jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone and astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber,negative
together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets,negative
one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of goldtoned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship,negative
what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances,negative
director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects,negative
the problem here is he is making a bigbudget science fiction film,negative
it has some effects but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen,negative
the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewers imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting,negative
that could be a reasonable approach in a lowbudget film,negative
but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster,negative
it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put they dont,negative
hoffmans acting seems muted,negative
jackson seems to laid back,negative
we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads,negative
levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance,negative
and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybodys guess a,negative
cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price,negative
look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors,negative
most science fiction spectaculars these days have secondtier actors and firsttier special effects,negative
levinson tries secondtier effects and firsttier actors but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer,negative
perhaps scifi spectaculars are just not an actors medium,negative
the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
susan grangers review of session 9 usa films,negative
sometimes you just get more than your bargained for like when bostonbased hazmat elimination run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant david caruso assures a town engineer paul guilifoyle that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week,negative
erected in 1871 deserted and decomposing since 1985 the danvers mental hospital is one of the most malevolent locations ever chosen for a film,negative
the structure is so massive with its labyrinth of rubblestrewn corridors collapsing floors stagnant pools of water isolation cells and ominous surgical chambers where experimental prefrontal lobotomies were performed that their task seems impossible within that time frame,negative
and each member of their inexperienced crew stephan gevedon brandon sexton iii and josh lucas is coping with his own personal demons as one by one their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which theyre working,negative
the films title is derived from salvaged reeltoreel audiorecorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities,negative
by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters,negative
filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsawmassacretype ghost story but the script lacks structure and isnt particularly scary,negative
the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 session 9 is a dark gloomy 4 silly me at,negative
first i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs danvers the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcocks truly terrifying rebecca that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley,negative
a number of critics have decided that its open season on freddie prize jr slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in soundalike disposable teen fluff like head over heels boys and girls down to you and shes all that,negative
while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend his talent is not,negative
i first saw him in the independent dark comedy the house of yes where he gave a subtle impressive performance as the younger brother in one of americas freakiest families,negative
prinze has the acting chops he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grownup movies to show the nonbelievers that he has what it takes,negative
summer catch certainly wont help his case,negative
inoffensive but utterly generic the baseballrelated romantic comedy does little more than kill time,negative
the story deals with the love affair between tenley jessica biel a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan prinze a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a bigtime baseball star,negative
ryans preoccupation with his new honeybunny drives her elitist father bruce davison crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team,negative
its a wonder the kid has any time to pitch as his time is occupied with making out with tenley fighting with her dad bonding with his own dad fred ward who deserves better than this fighting with his brother jason gedrick and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates,negative
the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky characterheavy baseball movie like bull durham but havent got a clue how to get there,negative
and so they glide from one clich to the next for 108 minutes,negative
the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a centerfielder from texas,negative
in an early barroom scene blucas best known as demonfighting riley finn from buffy the vampire slayer hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states he does have a nice ass,negative
a bubble butt,negative
when lillard gives him an are you insane,negative
look blucas calmly says its nothing sexual then goes on to evaluate the hindends of some other players including lillards,negative
speaking of asses prinze does not bare his in the movie,negative
the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract so two stuntbutts were employed for a couple of seminude shots,negative
blucas whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story gets another unique moment late in the film,negative
sick of hearing teammates make fat chick jokes he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amplysized ladies,negative
while his speech still ends up objectifying women it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie,negative
trivial tidbit summer catch marks a scooby doo summit,negative
marc blucas appears in jay and silent bob strike back as fred from the scooby doo gang while freddie prinze jr plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon,negative
working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a frontline african american actress like jada pinkett smith,negative
despite being one of the freshest talents available pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts a low down dirty shame the nutty professor,negative
the problem is of course that there arent many good roles available for black women,negative
take away the likes of waiting to exhale set it off soul food and eves bayou and all thats left is a chance to be someones girlfriend a local whore or a murder victim,negative
as a result for pinkett smiths first opportunity atop the marquee she is stuck in a stupid formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo,negative
actually woo the latest directorial effort from daisy v s,negative
mayer party girl could have been worse than it is,negative
the film offers a few funny albeit juvenile moments and the onscreen relationship between pinkett smiths woo and tommy davidsons tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two arent forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags,negative
unfortunately huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a tripledigit i q,negative
the situations are painfully contrived the main characters are lifted right out of sitcoms and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of free lobotomy lab experiment,negative
woo is a spontaneous energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places,negative
her latest relationship with a testosteroneoverdosed drugdealer came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper,negative
now her friend celestrial girlina predicts that shes about to meet mr right and that hell be a virgo,negative
later that day woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order who just happens to be a virgo,negative
its not love at first sight however,negative
things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a quiet dinner,negative
in the onehundred year history of motion pictures there have been a ton of bad white movies about mismatched lovers so i suppose its only fair that we get a black effort of the same low caliber,negative
as in all romantic comedies we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together,negative
the question is are their courtship rituals entertaining,negative
in a good entry to the genre the audience becomes caught up in the love story no matter how familiar it is,negative
in woo the constant reliance upon unfunny moronic humor sinks the project,negative
for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes theres a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top,negative
sadly thats one of the films most enjoyable sequences and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional,negative
despite exuding charm from every pore theres little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c johnsons script,negative
since it misses the mark by so much a better name for woo might have been whoops,negative
hollywood never fails to astound me,negative
every time i think those cokedup little buggers have hit rock bottom they come up with a new excavating tool,negative
i was truly convinced that wild wild west marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless but then along comes end of days to prove me wrong,negative
this big budget brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music grisly violence explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects,negative
the result,negative
nothing but groans and yawns,negative
even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept,negative
at the very least end of days should have done us the courtesy of being badenoughtobegood but it cant even manage that,negative
its just lousy,negative
arnold schwarzenegger still recovering from heart problems and batman robin plays an excop turned security agent or bodyguard or something,negative
along with his obligatory comic relief partner kevin pollak impersonating matthew perrys chandler character from friends he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo,negative
it seems that satan gabriel byrne gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years and here i thought hed pulled it off with the republican landslide of 94,negative
if he has sex with 20year old christine york robin tunney the chosen one their child will be the antichrist or at least a brat,negative
ah but this deal has more catches than a new years eve pass from a halfway house,negative
the unholy union must take place on december 31 1999 you see 999 is just 666 turned upside down but only between 11 p m and midnight no wonder this guy is so cranky,negative
and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church the devil wont know where she is because he cant see into the sanctuary,negative
you know its kind of like supermans xray vision and lead walls only evil,negative
a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl,negative
arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan if youll pardon the expression,negative
and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own,negative
oh the anguish,negative
oh the humanity,negative
oh the writing,negative
andrew w marlowes screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane schwarzeneggers character,negative
cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first lethal weapon preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter,negative
twenty minutes later hes racing through the bowels of new york city deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling,negative
when cane meets up with christine york he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter,negative
in case anyone misses the connection the camera comes in for a close up of christines music box which just happens to be identical to one owned by canes daughter,negative
subtle marlowe subtle,negative
speaking of cameras director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowes script and make it even more selfimportant murky and annoying,negative
hyams direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces punctuated with loads of big explosions,negative
eager to satisfy arnolds core audience he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well,negative
what a guy,negative
had the film delivered some decent scares or even maintained a consistently ominous tone the bombastic clich s might have been tolerable but end of days is simply a flaccid special effects show,negative
the cast is just as ineffective,negative
in his early scenes gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster,negative
kevin pollak comes and goes quickly robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold well hes a better actor than casper van dien,negative
that should count for something,negative
way back in the aftermath the exorcist and the omen supernatural swill like end of days might have passed muster as a bmovie,negative
but that was then and this is now,negative
the xfiles and buffy the vampire slayer deliver real scares on a weekly basis and if we want to see the devil all we have to do is flip on the 700 club and take a gander at pat robertsons grinning maw,negative
after enduring end of days all i can say is get thee behind me satan,negative
and while youre at it get thee a better agent as well,negative
plot two teen couples go to a church party drink and then drive,negative
they get into an accident,negative
one of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life and has nightmares,negative
whats the deal,negative
watch the movie and sorta find out,negative
critique a mindfuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea but presents it in a very bad package,negative
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films and these folks just didnt snag this one correctly,negative
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly,negative
so what are the problems with the movie,negative
well its main problem is that its simply too jumbled,negative
it starts off normal but then downshifts into this fantasy world in which you as an audience member have no idea whats going on,negative
there are dreams there are characters coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparitions there are disappearances there are a looooot of chase scenes there are tons of weird things that happen and most of it is simply not explained,negative
now i personally dont mind trying to unravel a film every now and then but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again i get kind of fed up after a while which is this films biggest problem,negative
its obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes,negative
and do they make things entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime,negative
not really,negative
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this so we actually figured most of it out by the halfway point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense but it still didnt the make the film all that more entertaining,negative
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding,negative
i mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy,negative
okay we get it there,negative
are people chasing her and we dont know who they are,negative
do we really need to see it over and over again,negative
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie,negative
apparently the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves and it shows,negative
there mightve been a pretty decent teen mindfuck movie in here somewhere but i guess the suits decided that turning it into a music video with little edge would make more sense,negative
the actors are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in a new neighborhood,negative
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who holds her own throughout the entire film and actually has you feeling her characters unraveling,negative
overall the film doesnt stick because it doesnt entertain its confusing it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it,negative
oh and by the way this is not a horror or teen slasher flick its,negative
just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids,negative
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since,negative
whatever skip,negative
it,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
a nightmare of elm street 3 710 blair witch 2 710 the crow 910 the crow salvation 410 lost highway 1010 memento 1010 the others 910 stir of echoes 810,negative
robin williams this time without a beard returns to drama in this sloppy sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects,negative
he plays chris nielsen who meets annie annabella sciora and promptly marries her,negative
they have two great kids who sadly die in a car crash,negative
just when it couldnt get any worse chris gets killed in a car crash and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert gooding jnr,negative
annie cant take the grief anymore and kills herself,negative
all sounding like good fun so far,negative
the penalty for suicide is to go to hell and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller max von sydow,negative
based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson what dreams may come is clunky manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar,negative
this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made,negative
everything is wrong about this movie the performances are forced and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters,negative
williams puts on a convincing upset face but thats all it is a face,negative
theres no emotion behind it,negative
scioras performance is lazy and bogs down the whole film,negative
she may look pretty but she cant act,negative
max von sydow is o k as the traveller if nothing special,negative
cuba gooding jnr thankfully adds some bounce to his performance and is certainly the best performer in the film,negative
its a shame that his character is so flat and 2d and offers no room for improvement,negative
all the performers have to work with a soppy script that tries its best to get some emotion going but never takes off the ground,negative
there are some scenes which could be real heartwarmers but the faceless characters dont help to get anything out of the performers,negative
while films like e t used great actors music and direction to pull of a masterful hearttugging scene what dreams may come is haphazard expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically,negative
instead its all rather boring,negative
sure the music is pretty by michael kamen and the cinematography isnt bad by eduardo serra but theres something lacking,negative
the script doesnt help filled with hopeless romantic clich s and dud speeches,negative
richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin let alone being converted into a 70 million vehicle for robin williams,negative
despite being set in heaven what dreams may come is mightily depressing,negative
the film rushes a happy ending but everything before this is very very sad and black which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid,negative
but theres one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie the special effects,negative
heaven and hell are truly incredible places and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets,negative
but despite this what dreams may come proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998,negative
instead of raising questions about existence it raises boredom,negative
sadly i recommend you give this film a miss,negative
better luck next time robin,negative
a david wilcock review 1998,negative
you know for kids norville barnes,negative
in the james bond film diamonds are forever tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads,negative
bonds response is that it doesnt really matter as long as collars and cuffs match,negative
well collars and cuffs dont match in the real blonde,negative
what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny meandering comedy on screen,negative
the film supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business is wafer thin,negative
it plays like an ally mcbeal episode dragged out to the nth degree replete with a few unnecessary fantasy sequences,negative
tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea,negative
it isnt,negative
the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary,negative
matthew modine plays joe a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent,negative
hes 35 with no agent and no credits since hes too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas,negative
thats not really acting he tells his girlfriend of six years mary catherine keener with whom he bickers constantly about sex,negative
but they need the money so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video,negative
but its not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike played by elizabeth berkley still trying to jumpstart her career after showgirls,negative
this points out how artificial this whole business is one supposes,negative
dicillo has referred to the real blonde as offkilter but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff,negative
the film which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere is remarkably on kilter and with perhaps the single exception of the alwayslikable modine whos not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks the entire cast is vague and uninteresting,negative
catherine keener whos appeared in dicillos previous three films including the brilliant living in oblivion is at her most annoying in the real blonde,negative
look at her closely she really cant act at all,negative
her reactions are all wrong almost always out of sync with her costars,negative
she reacts too soon or too late to lines and situations,negative
she moves her eyes or her mouth far too much,negative
she frowns she yells she babblesshe blows chunks,negative
maxwell caulfield plays joes buddy bob the one obsessed with dating a natural blonde,negative
bobs personality not to mention caulfields acting ability parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera passion crest stiff and uninteresting,negative
maybe thats the point,negative
daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title a soap dish who beds bob both on and offcamera,negative
hannah looks about fifty in this movie shes only 37,negative
why is that,negative
almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples,negative
why is that,negative
marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer,negative
kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent,negative
buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink,negative
christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer,negative
and so on,negative
the best parts of the the real blonde are the beginning and the end brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog,negative
theres more depth and sincerity in a single closeup of her expressive face than in the entire film,negative
while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if its funny,negative
i want to be involved in show business one day,negative
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse,negative
this movie proves it for me,negative
i was a little worried about the last batman film as i thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up,negative
i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne,negative
they didnt,negative
kilmer did a good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did even jim carrey as the riddler and i cant stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles,negative
this film is different,negative
the cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction hes one of those directors whos good with actors terrible with camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith doesnt really give an impressive cast anything to do,negative
the cast is impressive clooney is a surprisingly good odonnell is a crafty robin as usual they couldve casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is a good poison ivy,negative
the major problem is schwarzenegger who is a terrible freeze,negative
his accent is so heavy you cant understand what he says and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say a limited amount of stuff and kill a bunch of guys then they figure nobodyll notice,negative
thats the trouble with me i notice,negative
schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but hollywood thinks he does,negative
patrick stewart was the person id heard that was considered to play freeze and he wouldve been so much better,negative
or sean connery but not arnold im not an actor but i play one in real life schwarzenegger,negative
i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film but it wouldve been nice if theyd casted a star that had talent for the role,negative
akiva goldsmiths screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film,negative
in a regular batman film theyd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more but elle macphersons julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is,negative
there is talk of a fifth batman movie,negative
my interest to see it is low but i hope its better than this,negative
if you dont want to waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster,negative
any other,negative
alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oftplayed character of dashing swordsman dartagnon in director peter hyams adventure the musketeer,negative
for some reason that i may figure out later i dont know why the time money and effort were put into the making of the musketeer,negative
it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this films xinxin xiong once upon a time in china and yuen wooping from crouching tiger hidden dragon,negative
the result is a mix of genres that dont mesh well,negative
elements of the ritz brothersstyle comedy for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 the three musketeers the man with no name from a fistful of dollars dartagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano,negative
the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the matrix crowd,negative
alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters,negative
the real problem with the the musketeer lies in the casting of the two lead romantically intertwined characters dartagnan and francesca mena suvari,negative
chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character a la chris odonnell but lacks any onscreen charisma,negative
suvari has the doeeyed pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen but she too does not have the chemistry to command the screen,negative
if the musketeer makes them any money they should invest in acting lessons,negative
stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one,negative
the supporting cast is on the surface impressive,negative
catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty dignity and humor especially when she plays off of dartagnans mentor planchet jeanpierre castaldi who reminds of andre the giant in the princess bride,negative
stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu but is given very little to help flesh out his character,negative
tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinals chief henchman febre,negative
he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout,negative
the rest of the players particularly the three musketeers aramis nick moran lock stock and two smoking barrels porthos steve spiers and athos jan gregor kremp are background fodder whose role is to come to dartagnans aid when needed,negative
peter hyams does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well,negative
a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps,negative
photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions dartagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them singlehanded he fights a gang of febres henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen with the obligatory branches hanging over the road he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy febre who murdered dartagnans folks years before,negative
it is all routine stuff,negative
the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap defying gravity up walls and from horse to horse,negative
it works in a scifi film like the matrix or in a classical fantasy like crouching tiger hidden dragon but just calls attention to itself in the musketeer,negative
at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used,negative
it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed,negative
with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d,negative
mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of film critic leonard maltin a trashy potboiler that appeals only to the sm crowd,negative
actually i think mandingo is a strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts,negative
its too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash,negative
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king,negative
one day in new orleans hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton,negative
although the movie never explains it a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley,negative
according to the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves,negative
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him,negative
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves,negative
meanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild,negative
hammond however is happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex,negative
it is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench a sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche,negative
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did,negative
of course its fine that hes slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife a white lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her,negative
so blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen,negative
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child,negative
hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child although its okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poisons blanche,negative
hammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water,negative
yes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive,negative
judging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation,negative
the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society,negative
when mandingo was released in 1975 it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs,negative
dramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically its mostly confused,negative
if one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics,negative
not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working except for a few house servants,negative
the men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner,negative
there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingos overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick although theres plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure,negative
some tried to write off mandingo as a blaxploitation film one of a number of quicklymade lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies but its not that easy,negative
mandingo was studiofinanced by paramount pictures and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible 1966 the remake of king kong 1976 and the illfated dune 1984,negative
the director was richard fleischer a veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including 20 000 leagues under the sea 1954 and fantastic voyage 1966 as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin 1952,negative
the script based on the supermarket bestseller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland was penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico,negative
james mason perry king and susan george were wellknown and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career,negative
so why is mandingo so bad,negative
a number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job,negative
wexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slavetalk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whutre you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed a black brother,negative
fleischers direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable,negative
nevertheless credit should be given where credit is due,negative
despite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery,negative
until then there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery,negative
even classics such as gone with the wind 1939 can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter,negative
mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasnt all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets,negative
but all this is constantly undermined by the films negligible pointofview it claims to see things from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners,negative
with a little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film,negative
while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals with them,negative
the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexlers script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing,negative
there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it,negative
steven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindlers list 1993 by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid,negative
the difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma,negative
mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished,negative
by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer its possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one,negative
action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup,negative
audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the films sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending which is an insulting copout,negative
somewhere out there maybe theres a small cadre of filmgoers who will appreciate spheres dubious charms but im not among them,negative
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by its hard to understand why the rights were optioned,negative
sphere is the kind of first class mess that only a topline director with an alist cast can create,negative
with expectations high and how could they not be considering that another barry hoffman collaboration the excellent wag the dog is still playing in theaters,negative
something this bad cant help but look even worse,negative
the last time a bigname bigbudget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last years batman robin and everyone knows how that movie was received,negative
sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james camerons the abyss but somewhere along the way it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort event horizon,negative
science and philosophy which are used to good effect during spheres first hour give way to mindless confusing action sequences,negative
attempts at characterization fall apart,negative
intelligent writing which is evident early on is replaced by hackneyed drivel,negative
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness,negative
but all that is just in preparation for the ending which is inexcusably awful,negative
this is the timehonored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect,negative
i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film,negative
there is some promise but its all in the setup,negative
were introduced to norman goodman dustin hoffman a psychologist who once wrote a 35 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered,negative
when one is found in the middle of nowhere 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee,negative
on the team with him are beth halperin sharon stone a biochemist who was once his student and lover harry adams samuel l jackson a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology and harold barnes peter coyote the government operative in charge of the mission,negative
together the five descend into the bowels of the ocean where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact,negative
for a while sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the manmeetsalien situation,negative
the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship apparently from the future offer intriguing possibilities,negative
then right around the onehour mark thats the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatevers left of titanic the virtually nonstop action begins and once it starts the script becomes superfluous,negative
this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension but instead he relies on loud overbearing music strange camera angles and quick cuts to make things exciting,negative
additionally because none of the characters are wellformed a common failing in anything penned by crichton whos more interested in technology than people viewers dont develop much of a rooting interest,negative
it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience,negative
what about that alist cast,negative
not surprisingly the most energetic performance is given by samuel l jackson but his harry isnt a person hes a walking plot device spouting occasionallywitty dialogue,negative
dustin hoffman isnt lively or particularly good its ironic that this which may be his worst work in a decade has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination for wag the dog,negative
sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat,negative
their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion automatons would have been as effective,negative
then theres queen latifa who despite getting fifth billing in the credits ahead of liev schreiber who boasts at least quadruple her screen time has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count,negative
i like to think that levinson and hoffman recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance the lowbudget picture was filmed during spheres lengthy preproduction phase,negative
if thats the case forgiveness is granted,negative
im less inclined to look favorably upon crichton although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume jurassic park and the levinsondirected disclosure come to mind,negative
even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process crichtons credit as a producer disallows him absolution,negative
he was a willing participant in a creative travesty,negative
no wonder sphere is being released in february in the midst of the early years cinematic wasteland,negative
it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninthconsecutive weekend atop the box office heap,negative
the ads for batman and robin scream the event of the summer is here and thats the problem,negative
the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it,negative
batman and robin is 126 minutes of lavish sets flashy costumes and big confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance,negative
its like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows bright busy and visually diverting but not very much fun,negative
it wasnt always this way,negative
tim burtons batman was an epic story of obsession and duality of darkness and revenge,negative
the film while far from perfect was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel,negative
batman was a creepy brooding creature of the night,negative
the joker brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson was at once charismatic and repellent,negative
batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin battling inner demons and one another over gotham citys breathtaking gothic skyline,negative
those days of the dark knight are gone replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck,negative
batman and robin has far more in common with the campy 60s batman tv show than with tim burtons tale of darkness,negative
the blame lies with director joel schumacher,negative
a former windowdresser schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes,negative
unfortunately when it comes time to have those people walk and talk he hasnt the faintest notion of what to do,negative
batman and robin is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that its often difficult to tell whos whacking who,negative
while the characters flail at each other oneliners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti,negative
a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film,negative
batman and robin doesnt merely lose momentum it stalls out completely on several occasions,negative
its rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one,negative
ironically the parts of batman and robin that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne,negative
easily the best batman yet clooneys expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesnt even hint at,negative
the films most effective scene is a tender quiet exchange between clooney and alfred michael gough bruce waynes butler and surrogate father,negative
as for the other heroes chris odonnells robin is enthusiastic perky and horny as hell while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl,negative
in a movie filled to the brim with major characters the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce waynes girlfriend is puzzling,negative
i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with builtin nipples shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight,negative
of course the real stars of a batman film are the villains and thats where batman and robin really suffers,negative
as mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion,negative
laboring under a ton of appliances schwarzenegger looks as if hes having trouble even moving in his suit let alone trying to act,negative
uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy,negative
she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character its apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain must be a cartoonish bumbling nerd,negative
once thurman transforms into the ecopsychotic poison ivy she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss,negative
thurman fails to maintain the characters maniacal sense of style though and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film,negative
the biggest lesson to be learned from batman and robin is that more is not better,negative
joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is,negative
some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam,negative
i dont think so,negative
my prescription,negative
fire joel schumacher but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishists convention so hell understand that theres no hard feelings,negative
give alicia silverstone her walking papers while keeping clooney odonnell and michael gough,negative
call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman,negative
then ditch the campiness and for the love of pete lose the event mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time,negative
perhaps if the impostors didnt have so much going for it it wouldnt have been such a tremendous disappointment,negative
written directed and produced by one of its two stars stanley tucci whose last picture was the indie smash hit big night the impostors almost never catches fire,negative
sputtering like a twoday old campfire the story plays like an adlib sketch that was never polished or completed,negative
the films other star oliver platt was hilarious as the senators aide in bulworth,negative
the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent including woody allen steve buscemi hope davis alfred molina campbell scott lili taylor and tony shalhoub,negative
all are wasted save allen who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes,negative
the audience will easily identify with allens sentiments,negative
with the exception of a single original joke involving mirrorimaged subtitles the movie engenders little genuine laughter,negative
the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it,negative
the plot for the movie involves two starving actors maurice oliver platt and arthur stanley tucci who accidentally end up on a cruise ship,negative
in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor alfred molina who is chasing them they dress up as ships stewards,negative
the overthetop script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer,negative
when the leads hide from their pursuers arthur covers maurices mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze,negative
at other times we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else while darting in and out of staterooms,negative
with the films chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce,negative
the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having,negative
too bad they werent more concerned with the audiences potential enjoyment,negative
the jokes frequently framed in silence fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground,negative
one wonders if anyone ever viewed the films dailies,negative
surely if they had they would have realized what leaden results they were producing,negative
it is tricky having good actors play bad ones but if they couldnt pull it off they should have just given up,negative
the show is over for this fella steve buscemis character says towards the end,negative
the mystery is why they didnt all give up in the beginning,negative
there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast,negative
the impostors runs 1 42,negative
it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up,negative
mugshot matt mahurin cast belinda becker stella michael williams rumor robert knepper robert walker random willie lassic young brother of rumor maxine joiner rumors mother runtime 87 mortal films 1995,negative
reviewed by dennis schwartz,negative
a bleak indie film about a stolen identity,negative
theres not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging,negative
it falls into the category of being a pretentious arthouse film leaving a bitter taste in ones mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues,negative
it tries to make a heavyhanded point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment with their only way out being crime,negative
but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell that its hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean,negative
the relationship between the black mugger and his white victim is a cloudy one which the film never determines what it wants to say about it,negative
matt mahurin is virtual oneman crew in putting this film together who is a still photographer in his day job,negative
the film works best as a visually challenging piece as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding,negative
a white photographer robert knepper is mugged by a black gang while hes on a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at night,negative
he becomes a victim of amnesia and his head is bloodied as hes left in a deserted harlem building as the gang leaves him for dead but one of the muggers rumor michael williams comes back and pretends to help him,negative
hes a wouldbe photographer who keeps a scrapbook entitled mugshots in the project apartment he shares with his mother and younger brother,negative
keeping his victim in the dark about who he is by calling him joe and not telling him whats happening he becomes the photographer for a few days,negative
he enters the photographers stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend stella belinda becker,negative
shes the only one in the film who could act,negative
the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground,negative
it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks as if its a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging,negative
back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its bigscreen update of the cult 1960s scifi tv show lost in space complete with inperson appearances by cast members mimi rogers matt leblanc lacey chabert jack johnson and even gary oldman,negative
that should have set off my warning alarmsthe last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an inperson cameo to peddle,negative
last action hero,negative
but no like millions of others i bought into the hype and got lost,negative
if only i had gotten lostliterallyon the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slappedtogether blockbuster wannabe,negative
you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film,negative
at the convention goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series and if that really is the case id hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in,negative
to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin withwhich there most certainly is not,negative
after the setup in which the robinson familyfather john william hurt looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews mother maureen rogers wasted daughters judy heather graham ditto and penny a heavily madeup chabert looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things and son will young newcomer johnson making the best of it and pilot don west leblanc doing a bad han solo impression find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr smith a watereddown but stilllively oldman cashing a paycheck and loving every minute the scripts stream of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes alongand hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting,negative
they encounter another ship,negative
they board it,negative
alien spiders attack them,negative
they return to their ship,negative
the other one explodes,negative
they land on a deserted planet,negative
and so on,negative
an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act but goldsman doesnt seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device when one characters past self dies the future incarnation inexplicably lives on,negative
the look and effects should be lost in spaces aceinthehole but hopkins even manages to botch that,negative
for a bigbudget film the visual effects are incredibly shoddy,negative
in one composite background shot i could see the blue outline around oldman the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like,negative
digital effects,negative
but nothing in those shots is as jawdroppingly unconvincing as blawp a monkeylike space creature that becomes pennys pet,negative
entirely computergenerated and every inch showing it blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game,negative
apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it how else can one explain the graininess of blawps composite shots with the human actors,negative
but in doing so the seams are that much more obvious,negative
you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystalclear solo reaction shot of judy,negative
new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the longrunning star trek cash cow at paramount,negative
i dont think so,negative
in a few years the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question what film ended titanics 15week reign at the top of the weekend box office,negative
while watching loser it occurred to me that amy heckerlings true genius as a filmmaker is casting,negative
in fast times at ridgemont high she gave us sean penns jeff spicoli in look whos talking she turned bruce willis into a wisecracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival in clueless she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is or was alicia silverstone,negative
she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws,negative
unfortunately she may also be starting to understand that she understands,negative
giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies,negative
giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal is the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser,negative
naturally heckerling makes her protagonist an allaround swell guy,negative
paul tannek jason biggs is a smalltown boy who gets a scholarship to nyu then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the coldhearted big city,negative
paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman his roommates adam zak orth chris tom sadoski and noah jimmi simpson are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul,negative
paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar in this case the lovely dora diamond mena suvari,negative
dora has problems of her own including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor edward alcott greg kinnear thats more than slightly onesided,negative
theyre two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people so clearly they belong together even if paul is a loser,negative
i must confess that for a while i was suckered in by heckerlings casting,negative
jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence,negative
theyre pleasant enough to watch and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists arent,negative
then it gradually becomes clear that theres virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort,negative
in theory loser is a romantic comedy but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film notable exception a cameo by a scenestealing comic actor as a video store clerk,negative
instead of taking any time to make the characters situations funny heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters situations pathetic,negative
she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless nor any of that films interest in lively plotting not surprisingly since cluelesss plot came via jane austens emma,negative
she simply turns the film into a pity party,negative
since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character you might think that those characters would be interesting or at least slightly complicated,negative
instead you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that theres no reason to watch them,negative
paul isnt just a nice guy hes flawless consequently hes a central character who does absolutely no growing,negative
his roommates arent just inconsiderate theyre actively evilblackmailing professor alcott drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name,negative
and professor alcott isnt just manipulative he turns dora into his house slave,negative
doras unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser and even that isnt explored in sufficient detail,negative
theres more ambiguity in the 30second snippet from alan cummings broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser its one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations its another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush,negative
and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow,negative
i dont know,negative
comic,negative
still i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora,negative
that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkels scarborough,negative
instead of giving the sequence a knowing winka reference to the graduate a hint that paul is becoming an overlysensitive clichheckerling plays it deadly straight,negative
even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonists foibles she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint,negative
cluelesss cher had her selfabsorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness,negative
in loser amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness her one show of wit involves naming pauls dorm hunts hall after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall,negative
her gift with casting proved to be her curse,negative
loser may be a crashing bore but gee arent those two kids swell,negative
the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john mayburys love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon,negative
as always jacobis acting is impeccable but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque,negative
the movie convincingly argues that francis played by jacobi was a completely despicable and vain individual but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude,negative
when interviewed by a fawning talk show host francis calls his style chance brushstrokes,negative
starting with a burglary of franciss flat the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie,negative
the camera shots are heavy on the avantgarde angles lots of wideangle closeups and distorted shots filmed through coloredglass reflections,negative
the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man,negative
daniel craig in a lifeless performance plays the burglar and boxer george dyer,negative
when francis lays eyes on him after the breakin francis promises not to call the police if hell stay for sex,negative
he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed,negative
he thinks that franciss paintings have no bloody use and the movie presents no counterargument,negative
writer maybury barely outlines franciss character and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma,negative
we learn little of george other than franciss reason for liking him georges amorality and innocence,negative
franciss love of sadomasochism is shown early and often,negative
boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match,negative
as the fighters head is sliced open with a heavy blow the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood,negative
francis appears to be in complete ecstasy,negative
another of franciss favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities,negative
as the carnage mounts we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience,negative
in a film that tries obsessively to shock one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident,negative
franciss mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother the father and the boy,negative
sometimes the script throws us tidbits of franciss wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful,negative
im optimistic by nature,negative
im optimistic about nothing,negative
loneliness is my only true companion,negative
we learn more details about franciss makeup techniques than about the man himself,negative
he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth,negative
full of metaphorical interpretations the films best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom,negative
mistaking franciss picture of a toilet for the genuine article he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly,negative
like a parody of a bad art house movie love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling,negative
by the end the audience hasnt learned any more than it could have in a threeminute sketch,negative
love is the devil runs 1 30,negative
the film is not rated but should be considered nc17 for violence profanity graphic sex nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers,negative
sometimes when i decide to write a short story or a poem i think of a title first and then think of a subject to go with it,negative
it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence,negative
i wouldnt be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it,negative
the title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began,negative
of course my attention dwindled shortly into the film,negative
disturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous,negative
its a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex,negative
its a suspense film with no suspense,negative
its an evil small town story with no story to speak of,negative
its a disaster a listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses onestardom because of a few good sequences a mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits,negative
our main man is a fellow named steve clark blandly played by jimmy marsden,negative
he moves to a small town with his family after tragically his brother shoots himself,negative
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange homevideo like nightmares that he has occasionally,negative
the big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friends,negative
marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject,negative
as a social reject he falls in with some pretentious dopesmoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes,negative
gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the blue ribboners are actually a bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people,negative
so its up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 solve the mystery and 2 do something about it,negative
by the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the film still doesnt make any sense,negative
disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg,negative
ive seen his name around recently he was one of the toucheruppers on the armageddon script and i imagine that for the most part he knows what hes doing when it comes to screenwriting,negative
he did however have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out,negative
evil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also a dismal failure but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work,negative
rosenbergs script is a complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization,negative
and it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained,negative
there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks but the film never explains exactly what is happening,negative
they get strapped to chairs a microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sexcrazed superviolent machinelike creatures,negative
the doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film,negative
much of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act,negative
in one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria,negative
up front i should say that in four years of high school i did not eat in the cafeteria even once,negative
that aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorlyshown,negative
for instance he points to the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops,negative
its such an obvious cliche that i cant believe rosenberg even bothered,negative
most of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me,negative
anymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit,negative
this picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy,negative
the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry,negative
horror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid,negative
there are a few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn,negative
i also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler,negative
he has a few lines that are surprisingly thoughtprovoking,negative
the acting is largely a waste of talent,negative
marsden is as i said bland thought not particularly bad,negative
bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted,negative
stahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isnt good enough to hone in on their skills stahls performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads,negative
none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cutouts of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isnt all that cool,negative
disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film and it started out a wreck before shooting even began,negative
im surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film or that it would make a lot of money at the box office,negative
its not boring or even blatantly awful but its an uninspired lump of a film,negative
it sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable,negative
so if you go to see this film take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it never ends,negative
to put it bluntly ed wood would have been proud of this,negative
a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor hokey drama zero logic and a crap screenplay,negative
also a beautifully anticlimactic ending,negative
not to say it didnt look intriguing when i saw the previews,negative
so much for truth in advertising,negative
roland emmerich whos later independence day would look like the 400 blows compared to this cowrited and directed this inane scifi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens,negative
in a useless opening sequence men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it,negative
it wouldnt be till present day 94 till they would actually figure it out,negative
theyre decipherer,negative
a slightlyneurotic scientist nice twist dr dan jackson james spader doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare whos life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word,negative
why do they use him to decipher what no one else could,negative
so there is a hokey ending,negative
duh,negative
he figures it out in about a minute,negative
yea,negative
and then they get a suicidal colonel or something jack oneill kurt russel with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flattop that would make howie long snap into a fetal position,negative
why a suicidal colonel,negative
for the ending,negative
youll get the hang of this,negative
they open the stargate a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad,negative
after an overdone special effects thing theyre inside a goddam pyramid,negative
so they went to egypt right,negative
wrong,negative
theyre on another planet that was filmed in egypt,negative
they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra the sun god the androginous jaye davidson with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma and there are fights explosions and a kiss between two people,negative
yea,negative
also melodrama stupidity hokey scenes and a bizarre language,negative
an anticlimactic ending ends with stupid lines say hello to king tut asswhole,negative
the quintessential line lemme tell ya and some convenient pesudopseudopseudocharacter development,negative
by the end you just wanna go home and watch i dont know the outer limits or something,negative
the scripts terrible,negative
the special effects are okay but nothing great,negative
the storys so weak that its almost opaque,negative
the whole experience just isnt worth it unless youre so bored that youd consider watching a full house marathon or,negative
this,negative
id pick this obviously but still its just not fun at all,negative
and i cant wait for it to premier on mst3k,negative
inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price,negative
directed by william malone,negative
starring geoffrey rush famke janssen and chris kattan,negative
rated r contains violence profanity and brief nudity,negative
synopsis eccentric millionaire price offers 1 000 000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium,negative
the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients,negative
comments house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price,negative
in an obvious homage the millionaires name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have,negative
this is a pretty bad horror film yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining and house on haunted hill is just such a film,negative
it is surprisingly better than another recent haunted house remake the haunting a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson,negative
the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face,negative
house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a bmovie 40 years old and makes no illusion that its a crappy horror movie,negative
thus somehow it proves slightly more successful,negative
i cant think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast,negative
it is this cast which lifts this hohum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror,negative
price the main character is played by geoffrey rush the academyaward winning actor of shine,negative
rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry a spiral reminiscent of ben ghandi schindlers list kingsleys ridiculous appearance in the camp scifi classic species,negative
i dont know why but sometimes its entertaining to see quality actors in bad movies,negative
more surprises,negative
rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure rather lamely too and singer lisa loeb,negative
appears as a tv news reporter,negative
the highlight of the cast however has to be saturday night live member chris kattan,negative
kattans comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium,negative
while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to whats exactly going on the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense,negative
a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too,negative
house on haunted hill i suspect has just about left the secondrun theaters,negative
its worth catching on cable next year if you get a chance,negative
if you have a choice pick this movie over the haunting its the better of two evils you could say,negative
though more appropriately perhaps itd be better to say that its the better of two turkeys,negative
one of my brothers favorite movies is h b halickis 1974 cult flick gone is sixty seconds one of the best products of the carchase genre that provided drivein fare during the 1970s,negative
chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had a strong visceral appeal,negative
although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of gone in sixty seconds is relatively weak and dull,negative
randall memphis raines nicolas cage is a retired car thief who runs a gocart track,negative
he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi would not take up boosting cars,negative
however kip became a thief anyway and now hes in big trouble,negative
kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri christopher eccleston by the end of the week,negative
calitri expects memphis to fulfill kips bargain if he doesnt come through kip dies,negative
memphis gathers his old crew angelina jolie robert duvall will patton chi mcbride and vinnie jones and kip brings his boys t j,negative
cross william lee scott scott caan and james duval,negative
as if calitri breathing down their necks wasnt bad enough the team is pursued by a cop delroy lindo whos still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster rap star master p who wants to take over calitris clients,negative
watching gone i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one,negative
maybe thats why the first fortynine are fairly easy and the thrills are saved for eleanor a 1967 shelby gto a model that has always eluded memphis,negative
but the big chase doesnt live up to the long wait,negative
i had high hopes for gone because it is director dominic senas second film,negative
kalifornia his 1993 debut was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience,negative
in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot a couple gives a serial killer a ride and successfully endowed it with deeper significance,negative
in gone he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who cant communicate with each other but that goal just doesnt mesh with this plot,negative
gone either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough,negative
its not light enough to be fun or mean enough to be intense,negative
this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it,negative
the lack of action is a waste of the premise which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever,negative
the weak script is a waste of a talented cast,negative
in a newsweek interview last year sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies,negative
much as i like cage for every good picture he does leaving las vegas bringing out the dead there are two major stinkers snake eyes con air 8mm city of angels,negative
that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast but cage has real talent,negative
its a shame to waste it in glitzy superficial tripe like gone in 60 seconds,negative
a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent but one with no edge to it,negative
it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich s and stock characters of this genre,negative
though its a wellwritten and wellacted fluff piece it still does not have too much to say that is surprising,negative
its made for the gentle arthouse set those who dont want something too disturbing to think about,negative
its about a critically successful writer husband alec pryce who is so selfabsorbed that hes threatened by his department store floorwalking model wife kate bouquet who wants to be a writer,negative
she meets his crass publisher vanni corso walken another selfabsorbed man and a predictable relationship occurs,negative
the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husbands first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet,negative
she now wants her own identity and her independence,negative
the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie,negative
the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax,negative
its set in london and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper vanni,negative
she later meets him as her hubbys new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel,negative
alec who is an obnoxious grouse someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book publishedwhich only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni,negative
the publisher is proud that hes a mammas boy who never married and is a selfmade man who has earned millions,negative
he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it as he proudly tells kate if my father could sell pizzas in harlem i could sell culture in europe,negative
the only thing that couldnt be sold is this stiff story and tired plot line,negative
the mystery to me is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy,negative
she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soontobecomebeleaguered vanni,negative
when she writes a second novel he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did,negative
it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper,negative
a business affair was loosely based on the reallife literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly in their celebrated 1950s love triangle,negative
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad,negative
so i didnt expect too much from this,negative
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre,negative
i thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont,negative
i thought mabe it will be fun,negative
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing,negative
but by the end of it i thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont,negative
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality,negative
here is the story in the monstrously overdecorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation,negative
among them is a sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones a cynical dope owen wilson and a gentle and emotional lady lily taylor,negative
actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch,negative
what happens,negative
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself,negative
it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights,negative
portals become veiny stainedglass eyeballs,negative
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth,negative
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains,negative
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen,negative
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture,negative
is that exciting or what,negative
the worst thing about it is that it didnt have to be bad,negative
its based on a great book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson,negative
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent,negative
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience,negative
the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses,negative
and with a 70 mill,negative
budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror,negative
de,negative
bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening,negative
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush,negative
but why give him a more serious material,negative
in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bonts career as a director,negative
yet it wouldnt be fair to say that everything is bad,negative
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky,negative
but this is where the good things end,negative
the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life,negative
its nothing more than a special effectsextravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesnt engage,negative
at first you do not know whats going on,negative
is this part of the experiment,negative
are these hallucinations,negative
projections of the subconscience,negative
paranoia,negative
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening,negative
the house is actually possessed,negative
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window,negative
for ever i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and thats what i got,negative
i believe hichock once said that its,negative
better to wait for a climax than to see one,negative
this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid,negative
they are impossible to take seriously,negative
any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubricks the shining are absolutely baseless,negative
shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality,negative
haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of,negative
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film,negative
casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse,negative
but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid,negative
this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard,negative
the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend ned,negative
kelly the socalled robin hood of the aussies,negative
but he fails to be convincing in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly,negative
the film opens to a prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution,negative
then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback coming home from jail after a 3year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family,negative
this scene is set in 1871,negative
in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings as he sings shel silversteins lyrics which tells of neds hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic,negative
ned says a debt must be paid,negative
as he hears voices from his dead father his classdivided country and his conscience all telling him to get revenge,negative
so begins neds romp through australias outback seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered,negative
he begins by stealing horses after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray which favors the rich landowners,negative
when hes only 20 he forms a gang causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds,negative
when neds mother clarissa kaye is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 35 years ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mothers freedom,negative
when the authorities refuse the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers,negative
rampaging through the outback they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes who dont trust the traps police,negative
spoiler to follow in the next paragraph,negative
in the climax kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured,negative
neds brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive,negative
but kellys gang escapes as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers as they become decoys,negative
this was a flat presentation hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kellys call for justice,negative
jagger didnt have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson,negative
the story failed to focus on australia seemingly a more british film than australian,negative
under richardsons lackluster direction all jagger seemed to do was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge which soon became a shrill cry,negative
if you want to see a better film about ned kelly catch mad dog morgan 76 a much truer and more daring version with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kellys madness something this film could only do in a hohum manner,negative
star wars episode i the phantom menace 1999,negative
director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel l jackson oliver ford davies terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime 131 min,negative
us distribution 20th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements,negative
copyright 1999 nathaniel r atcheson,negative
a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review,negative
ive attempted to obey this rule in recent months but to do so would be impossible in this case,negative
the fact is nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them,negative
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people,negative
for me they calibrated my creativity as a child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well,negative
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that doesnt make me any less dedicated to it,negative
on the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on a very short list of why i love movies,negative
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series i got exited,negative
when i first saw screenshots from the film well over a year ago i embarked on a yearlong drool of anticipation,negative
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving i was ready to see the film,negative
but then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilms secretive snobbery over the picture,negative
in the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater i was tired of hearing about it,negative
i was tired of seeing cardboard cutouts of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell,negative
i just wanted to see the movie,negative
reader do not misunderstand,negative
i did not have an antihype reaction,negative
the hype was unavoidable,negative
i understand and accept the hype its just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released,negative
five minutes into the phantom menace i knew there was a problem,negative
who are these jedi knights,negative
i asked,negative
why are they churning out stale dialogue with machinegun rapidity,negative
why arent these characters being developed before their adventures,negative
why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film,negative
these were just some of my questions early on,negative
later i asked wheres the magic of the first three films,negative
and why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes,negative
by the end of the film i was tired maddened and depressed,negative
george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless mindless summer blockbuster,negative
the phantom menace is no star wars film,negative
take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and youre left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time,negative
its an embarrassment,negative
i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored or a new theme is examined or a special effects shot isnt used,negative
there are a few of each but theyre all token attempts,negative
the fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects,negative
this is not what i wanted to see,negative
i didnt want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth but i did,negative
the story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has a line in the film and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo,negative
naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people,negative
after picking up jar jar binks a completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august,negative
quigon knows that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys,negative
the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters,negative
there isnt anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form,negative
the way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory,negative
first of all we dont learn one single thing about quigon jinn,negative
not one thing,negative
what was his life like before this film,negative
well i imagine he didnt have one,negative
thats why he feels like a plot device,negative
this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why hes recently retired from film i dont blame him honestly,negative
obiwan a character i was really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting,negative
mcgregor has just a few lines so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere,negative
since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie,negative
things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshedout character in the film and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role,negative
i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting,negative
and when anakin says goodbye to his mother i found it moving,negative
also fairly good is portman and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written,negative
jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ive ever had to endure but hes more interesting than most of the humans,negative
as soon as the relativelybrief segment on tatooine is over its back to the mindnumbing special effects and depthless action scenes,negative
ive seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one ive seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie,negative
the reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint,negative
i cant say that i didnt find the effects original because i did the final battle between darth maul obiwan and quigon is visually exceptional as is most of the film,negative
but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome,negative
my breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky and i wanted that to go away,negative
cant we have one stinking scene that isnt bursting at the seems with a special effects shot,negative
i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours,negative
and then theres the question of magic,negative
what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi,negative
i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel,negative
john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction,negative
i think it comes right down to characters there are none here,negative
i longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but i got no such thing,negative
and what about the ridiculous expectations,negative
mine werent that high i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects,negative
instead i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show,negative
i dont hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it id like to forget that it exists and yet i cant,negative
its here to stay,negative
i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they dont then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series,negative
i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films,negative
i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them,negative
so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work,negative
i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning,negative
sigourney weaver whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 200 years later scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her,negative
in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being,negative
im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now well just ignore it and move on,negative
why you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated,negative
well the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature,negative
these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research,negative
they yawn were wrong,negative
it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary unflossed teeth,negative
theres a little saying that goes something like this if youre going to make a bad film do it well,negative
i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me,negative
alien resurrection a good example of a film that really gets up my nose is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one,negative
there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wanderingbutnotgoinganywhere plot,negative
in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off,negative
another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to,negative
fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable,negative
if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right,negative
one exciting scene is a credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one a cripple up a tall ladder with interesting results,negative
but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis,negative
so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is,negative
oh and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies the less i enjoy a film the more i eat,negative
so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still a long way ahead of the movie,negative
dreamworks skg running time 2 hours starring robert duvall tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year the second is the macho armageddon is actually a dull affair,negative
elijah wood plays leo biederman who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth,negative
tea leoni plays a rather crap news reporter jenny lerner who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew spurgeon tanner who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth,negative
also featuring is morgan freeman as the president and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jennys father and mother,negative
while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up as the trailers seem to promise the film is actually more of a character study if a very poor one,negative
the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film and not enough time to explore them all,negative
only the space crew are given any depth jenny lerner leo and the president are surprisingly 2d and we never get to know these characters,negative
and because i couldnt care for them i didnt really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not,negative
the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple and never really makes any interesting statements,negative
mimi leder the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker 1996 again directs in a hohum style and never really gets any emotion out of a scene which is a shame,negative
the cast are seemingly on autopilot although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good,negative
she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist,negative
robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role he just seems to be in this film for the money,negative
elijah wood one of the best child actors working today is surprisingly average although his choice of roles lately havent exactly been brilliant i e,negative
flipper 1996,negative
his role is also vastly underwritten,negative
morgan freeman again is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role,negative
like duvall he just seems to be in the film for the money,negative
the supporting cast are all o k none making much of an impression,negative
ok so deep impact may have messed up character wise but surely the special effects are good,negative
well yes and no,negative
although the special effects should be impressive with a massive tidal wave destroying new york the special effects look like well special effects,negative
sadly the waves looks like its been drawn on computer and doesnt look too good at all,negative
surprising really when the effects are done by industrial light magic who did the effects for the lost world and twister,negative
in the end deep impact is a wasted opportunity,negative
what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects,negative
the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect,negative
once again dreamworks has churned out another average movie,negative
lets hope armageddon is a bit better,negative
overall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities,negative
it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire,negative
usually you had to be an aristocrat a count such as dracula or karnstein,negative
to qualify youd have to have a modicum of sophistication so youd at least look cool or suave when biting into some young damsels throat,negative
but today in our overly politically correct world any scuzzylooking longhaired unshaven lout or any spikedhaired harridans can put the bite on you,negative
by the same token to be a vampire hunter one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier or at least one who retired with honors,negative
not in these times,negative
all you need are some sharp weapons some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy or a blade,negative
without sounding elitist the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity,negative
which brings us to blade the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which it seems half the population is putting the bite on the other half,negative
not only are there thousands of vampires but they seem to move from city to city pay off police departments and most importantly establish their own exclusive afterhours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower,negative
with all that blood you wonder why they have to hunt for victims,negative
you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes drycleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains,negative
blade which is based on a marvel comic book character is like a comic book all visual,negative
the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader deacon frost,negative
its all hokum and nonsense of course,negative
but the filmmakers play it straight,negative
unfortunately at least at the advance screening i attended the audience didnt see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings,negative
you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter,negative
another telltale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the heros costume more than the hero,negative
also it seems its not enough for todays vampire merely to have fangs,negative
he must also be proficient in the martial arts,negative
why a supernatural being one of the undead needs such skills is beyond me,negative
of course this concept dates to the 1974 hammer filmsrun run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires in which dracula is defeated by seven karatechopping siblings,negative
wesley snipes is buff as blade,negative
he growls his lines the few he has and spends most of the time glowering as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and coproducing this turkey,negative
blade is just another example of how the vampire film a once honorable member of the horror family has gone downhill,negative
this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face,negative
todays vampires lack the panache the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee,negative
they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers capes,negative
they are more farcical than frightful,negative
this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening,negative
the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and couldve been effective,negative
such is the case with urban legend the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks,negative
the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends,negative
examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house,negative
the killer wears one of those l l bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up so you cant see the face,negative
i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days,negative
anyhow the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric,negative
its a very good setup that promises more chills to come,negative
unfortunately the film never takes off from there,negative
the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus,negative
like most slasher flicks this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac or in this case an axe wielding maniac,negative
ive always wondered why these killers dont save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill,negative
after the fine first scene the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying youthoughtitwasthekillerbutwasjust someoneelse scares,negative
these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music,negative
i guess sudden sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days,negative
the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast,negative
the slasher appears attacks the victim is eviscerated and the tedious cycle appears anew,negative
false scares should always be used in moderation,negative
someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just arent as scary as they used to be,negative
this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commitits not frightening,negative
remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in scream and scream 2,negative
this movie still adheres to them,negative
tons of illogical moments about more than i really have the inclination to list,negative
and i dont mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense,negative
that type of illogical can be fun,negative
this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember,negative
the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that youll be laughing more than youll be screaming,negative
actually you wont be screaming at all,negative
at its best the acting can barely be called adequate and the script couldve definitely used a rewrite or two,negative
the film still manages to have some strong points,negative
the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans,negative
there are some intentionally funny moments,negative
these were exceeded by the unintentional ones,negative
the film is well made from a technical standpoint,negative
besides the first part there is also another good scene a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station,negative
if there had only been more sequences like this that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music urban legend mightve been worth your money,negative
there is a rule when it comes to movies,negative
a sequel is never as good as the original,negative
there are very few exceptions to this rule and texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is not one of them,negative
now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie and that this isnt even the first sequel to it you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience,negative
dont be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey a time to kill and renee zellweger jerry maguire,negative
they made this movie before they were stars,negative
judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons,negative
its a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey,negative
apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger,negative
apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day,negative
and i dont blame them they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them,negative
unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character,negative
while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control,negative
hey dont say i didnt warn you,negative
to make matters worse leatherface the chainsaw wielding maniac who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times has now become a full blown crossdresser and spends the entire movie in drag,negative
there is a plot to this movie but it isnt worth mentioning,negative
lets just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man mcconaughey and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving halfwitted sidekick,negative
man i cant get over just how bad this movie is,negative
this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities,negative
even the obligatory topless babe shot wasnt enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds,negative
the writing is bad the direction is even worse but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting,negative
this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch,negative
a guarantee you if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again,negative
how could a grated disney film based on meg cabots novel the princess diaries be anything but cute harmless fun,negative
easy,negative
take all the cute harmless fun out of it,negative
and while youre at it make it borrrring,negative
thats what director garry marshall screenwriter gina wendkos and not to be outdone producer whitney houston have done with the grated disney film the princess diaries,negative
you couldnt tell it from the audience though a braintree mass of growing glowing prepubescent girls and the odd parental popcorn perched about their persons who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddyduddy old me,negative
well i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over but that would have been too obvious,negative
too obvious is the least of the problems with marshalls film garry made a couple of other princess movies pretty woman and runaway bride but this ones way without julia roberts so maybe thats its problem,negative
in addition to being predictable as molasses the princess diaries has hardly got a laugh in it its a comedy could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long long stretches and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we havent even seen yet and probably never will except perhaps in the dvd edition,negative
marshall should take virtually all of the blame here since hes been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isnt working,negative
and hardly any of the princess diaries works works alas implies cleverness and theres none of that here either,negative
newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of the filmmakers go out of their way not to call it serbia which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words and now she mia is next in line to rule genovia hence the combo in the print ads,negative
julie andrews with the luminous factor cranked to 11 plays mias grandmother aka queen clarisse renaldi who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating talking and looking like a princess department although mias big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan,negative
does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh,negative
not really,negative
consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets,negative
also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock an evil cheerleader a dorkylooking best friend welcome to the dollhouse s heather matarazzo a sensitive auto and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mias chauffeurdriven limousine at every intersection,negative
a nonanimated grated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts all the good stuff has been exorcised from the finished product,negative
lame labored and lamentable the princess diaries is recommended for eightandahalf year olds of the feminine persuasion only all others would do well to avoid it like potholes the plague and the perfect storm,negative
plot upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself since the schools charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide,negative
critique despite this films interesting premise and dark subject matter this movie sucks because it is unfunny boring and presents us with one of tom everett scotts worst acting performances,negative
add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element many lame and corny jokes a long wait for the setup and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this black comedy if youre gonna create a black comedy dont chicken out in the endsee very bad things 810 for a perfect example and youve got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter,negative
i barely laughed at any gags found the bong element contrived and repetitive and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie if youre gonna make a bad college comedy at least slap in some free ta shots for the kids,negative
this ones not even worth the rental fellas,negative
skip it altogether,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars during auditions for that thing you do tom everett scotts first feature film role director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott couldve passed for hanks 15 years ago,negative
it wasnt until hanks wife rita wilson saw the audition tape and decided he was cute that hanks decided to risk hiring scott,negative
the actor who played scott cooper in this film markpaul gosselaar is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tvs saved by the bell,negative
his parents are dutch and named hans and paula,negative
and who wouldve guessed that this is director alan cohns first shot at directing a feature film,negative
tvs buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in simply irresistible,negative
sarah michelle gellar that neverceasing crusader against neverending evil every tuesday night on the wb network here plays a downonherluck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals,negative
taste test results some vampire slaying though out of place would have really livened this excruciating movie up,negative
simply irresistible is actually quite easy to deny a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on,negative
gellars amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom sean patrick flannery of powder around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the publics in her tiny tribeca eatery,negative
all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993s mexican classic like water for chocolate,negative
several differences one like water didnt have a telekinetic crab and two like water was a good film,negative
simply irresistible on the other hand is about as challenging as an easybake oven,negative
amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish,negative
the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals but its not like youre were going to miss much,negative
in fact take away the few instances of salty language and this has madefordisney channel written all over it,negative
but a majority of simply irresistible s resistibility factor has less to do with the aforementioned overkill than the bland leads tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that theres just no fun rooting for their inevitable happily ever after,negative
nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense so were left with a hohum relationship based on enchanted eclairs its not going to last long people,negative
perhaps sensing this the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley dylan baker and patricia clarkson but they dont go anywhere either,negative
in fact nothing in simply irresistible goes anywhere save for gellar and she doesnt go somewhere so much as you wish shed go somewhere like to a better movie,negative
already proving major talent with relatively few big and smallscreen roles shes the sole reason this overcooked souffle isnt completely fit for the garbage disposal looking smashing in her todd oldhamdesigned duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return,negative
its certainly a dish best not served in its current condition but one can only guess that without gellar simply irresistible would be strictly unwatchable,negative
if youre the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you,negative
indeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative ripoffs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them,negative
its difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film,negative
but at least were warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show,negative
what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie,negative
first the movie gives us an introductory premise,negative
huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared,negative
oooh scary,negative
secondly a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score,negative
third the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams,negative
he operates a sophisticated militarystyle pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy,negative
finally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him,negative
they are also mercenaries that have toughlooking haircuts talk with accents and try to show how macho they are,negative
during their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs,negative
spotting a cruise ship in the distance they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way,negative
little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster,negative
yet they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds,negative
this is nothing more than a bythebook action film,negative
their realization of the situation that theyre in doesnt happen until they are in the bowels of the boat,negative
those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed,negative
the corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scarefests must have,negative
yet despite the predictable nature of this film there are some scary boo moments,negative
but most of it is just outright silly,negative
and this film is unusually gory too,negative
monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains,negative
there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive,negative
he screams horribly as the monsters digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away,negative
additionally it borrows heavily from speed2 alien and a bunch of other recent films,negative
the mercenaries even run into a lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock,negative
to be honest when i left the theatre i just had to laugh at how witless the film was,negative
its moronic fun at best,negative
so if youre hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness then this might just hit the spot,negative
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting entertaining or convincing because of one fundamental reason movies are made by adults and not teenagers,negative
occasionally however films like say anything dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called teenagers,negative
cant hardly wait however does not,negative
instead the team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich found in the teenage genre strip it completely of perception intelligence and wit and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to,negative
cant hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation,negative
the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them theres the average male protagonist preston ethan embry prom queen and cheerleader amanda jennifer lovehewitt football star mike peter facinelli white rapper wannabe kenny seth green computer geek william charlie korsmo and brainy outsider denise lauren ambrose,negative
i couldnt stand any of those characters,negative
whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming yo i gotta have sex tonight,negative
all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film,negative
apparently cant hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that its not funny,negative
in all honesty elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour,negative
and when i say forced i mean it,negative
they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange,negative
this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour,negative
for instance cant hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as i am a sex machine,negative
for some reason elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough eventually it will be funny,negative
if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk now thats funny,negative
this is crap but honestly what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker ing expresidents,negative
especially when their supporting players in clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief lauren bacall as a former first lady and john heard as the dan quayleish vice president,negative
yup youre talkin presold property here and for warner brothers the perfect fit into their nowritual grumpy old men holiday slot,negative
for the nondiscriminating viewer my fellow americans is fine,negative
the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political thriller roadcomedy,negative
they did in mine heaven help us,negative
for the rest of us the movie is immediately tiresome,negative
the tone is terrible and the banter is worse,negative
forget wit lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie,negative
has anyone counted the number of first penis references,negative
sure some of the bits are absurdly funny including a mens room macarena joke the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels and an all dorothy marching band performing over the rainbow at a gay mens march,negative
the get there from here though you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time,negative
judas priest is there a single moment of silence in this film,negative
even the dialogue gets drowned out,negative
what a waste,negative
dont let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare,negative
no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes a vain attempt at that,negative
any moves to glamorise his life which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness,negative
this movie about his life although well written puts too much makeup on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne,negative
oh well lets fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious playwrite who falls in love with a beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night,negative
it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and thats how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama,negative
but i guess my version probably wouldnt draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen,negative
so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul,negative
i think not,negative
as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie,negative
i think not,negative
in many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade,negative
another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over a more polished cate but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you,negative
the ads make hanging up seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters,negative
anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed,negative
all of the movies funny scenes were included in the ad,negative
so what do we get,negative
eve marks meg ryan just put her father lou mozell walter matthau into a hospital,negative
once upon a time lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his nowestranged wife,negative
his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne who gave him a giant bulletshaped trophy,negative
now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly,negative
eve tries to convince her sisters georgia diane keaton and maddy lisa kudrow that their father is dying and needs them,negative
both are slow to show concern,negative
so devoted eve stands vigil over her father who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia while running her own business planning special events and caring for her son jesse james,negative
some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st bernard for eve to care for,negative
the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eves events where georgia is the keynote speaker,negative
theres a superficial resemblance to shakespeares king lear senile king with three daughters one devoted saint and two selfish bitches but the material is apparently drawn from life,negative
sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team,negative
henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays including desk set and theres no business like show business,negative
delias novel the basis for the film is dedicated to henry,negative
surprisingly the script is as thin as an anorexics wet dream,negative
the virtue of a semiautobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available,negative
yet the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters,negative
also the spaces they inhabit seem artificial,negative
eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout no matter how putupon she is we cant feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day,negative
georgia is a famous magazine editor and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile,negative
when we first meet maddy shes fishing at a picturesque mountain stream,negative
i expected to see the credit cinematography by vanity fair,negative
and yes diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrows mother,negative
to her credit though she looks young enough to pull it off,negative
the one redeeming aspect of hanging up is that at its core is a truth about siblings,negative
theres always one on which everyone else in the family relies freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant,negative
my wife is the reliable child in her family for better or worse my brother has the role in mine,negative
being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling but it is a lot less work,negative
if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters mother pat,negative
in a devastating scene eve discovers that her mother doesnt love her,negative
although leachman is best known for comedies like young frankenstein and the mary tyler moore show her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in the last picture show,negative
bottom line everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they dont recognize real life anymore,negative
the red violin is a cold sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached,negative
its a movie that seems almost clinical as it traces the 300plusyears history of the legendary musical instrument of the title,negative
opening in the 17th century the story shows how violinmaker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son,negative
but when tragedy strikes the violin becomes the personification of its makers grief,negative
from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery,negative
again tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph,negative
we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in maos communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz samuel l jackson who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity,negative
the violin becomes morritzs obsession just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it,negative
morritz however is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creators intention,negative
the red violin could have been a touching inspirational story as soaring as a beethoven symphony,negative
however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer,negative
here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact,negative
girard for some unknown reason uses mostly master shots keeping his camera and thus us at a distance,negative
we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin,negative
its resonance its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression,negative
nor are any of the performances memorable,negative
its as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin,negative
the red violin promises much but delivers little,negative
it is dull at times a bit pretentious and a might murky,negative
the movies music soars over its story and performers,negative
and that is its only saving grace,negative
an affluent horse breeders past comes up to haunt him an ages old coverup and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices,negative
thats pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow,negative
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source,negative
the acting in particular i found very good the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie,negative
a few things about the story didnt sit very well with me for example the original scam and coverup heavily involved the character played by sharon stone yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better,negative
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot,negative
the characters aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing,negative
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener,negative
all these people acted their parts admirably as for the part that sharon stone played she played it well but the part was not utilized enough,negative
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie this is one of those occasions,negative
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject i myself wouldnt be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it,negative
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this,negative
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing the subject matter in my opinion wasnt interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it,negative
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself dont like it,negative
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow the acting was good but the story just didnt evolve enough and wasnt captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch,negative
although there is much going for the movie i didnt find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them,negative
i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie,negative
for a good ten years or so super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene,negative
now he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo who launched chows super stardom in the acclaimed a better tomorrow by moving to hollywood,negative
i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them,negative
chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt,negative
his final job requires him to kill a policemans seven year old boy,negative
this he refuses do and runs,negative
however he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job,negative
cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot outs which take place in various locations,negative
some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring,negative
the car wash scene i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked,negative
tut tut,negative
the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie and not on the content,negative
mia sorvino a passport forger is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun,negative
director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chows excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots,negative
chows trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale which in fairness is quite good and theres not even a toothpick in site,negative
and as for making chow shoot like a cop well thats damned unforgiveable,negative
to round up the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow,negative
it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video,negative
this is not what we wanted at all considering john woo was the exec producer,negative
did he have no say so at all,negative
watch the killer again and weep at the difference,negative
review by chris hill,negative
theres room at the top they are telling you still but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill,negative
well there goes another one,negative
sadly this like other movies this year wasnt good,negative
this one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite,negative
from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad and well i guess i was right,negative
with bad excuses for acting a horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction the bachelor is a terribly unfunny movie that doesnt work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance,negative
the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best,negative
the movie is troubled from the start because chris odonnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date,negative
here is the stupid plot chris odonnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years,negative
jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up,negative
he really doesnt realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her what he wants i never did catch,negative
so he proposes in a really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad,negative
he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any,negative
then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars as,negative
long as he marries before the next day at 6 05 pm,negative
now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an unfunny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths,negative
ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs,negative
even the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser arent even good,negative
the plot was a good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old,negative
the choppy dialogue and bad directing dont help things any,negative
even though chris odonnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him,negative
rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout,negative
her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen,negative
brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a bigheaded mogul who after a while became routine and old,negative
one really cant help but think that we have seen this stuff before,negative
its not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness,negative
the bachelor works on no good levels and in fact doesnt work at all,negative
ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career,negative
chris odonnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal,negative
he seems held back and really doesnt get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old,negative
artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and unnerving,negative
why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know,negative
maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success and sometimes i dont agree with other critics on movies even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts,negative
its based on the 1925 silent film seven chances which i am sure is very better than this mess,negative
even though some may think of this as a good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back,negative
besides being a terrible movie the bachelor is well a terrible movie,negative
it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really cant recommend this movie,negative
i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times,negative
the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes,negative
parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time,negative
being one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they i give up on filmmakers,negative
my inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air,negative
sure id seen them all at least once but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv,negative
even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb antifans still have the d i a 50s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous blue boy episode of dragnet,negative
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness think of the d i,negative
as what would happen if sgt,negative
joe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here a nononsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic,negative
in this election year im more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth,negative
the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters,negative
he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up,negative
the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much goes without saying,negative
this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason i was wondering if there would even be a plot,negative
i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants but the d i,negative
gives us more much more,negative
webbs mission is to make a man out of private owens the local screwup,negative
the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself,negative
whether the lace panties part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered,negative
this of course gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life a living hell,negative
for those of you who havent been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching heres a reprint of a typical monologue of his,negative
i cant duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what im talking about,negative
now you listen to me youngster,negative
someday youll wake up fighting on a beach and youll pray to god somebody doesnt get killed because of your foolishness,negative
ive got a headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours youre gonna turn around and ill be standing right there,negative
i couldnt write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d i,negative
nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard days work by going to the local bar where he orders a tomato juice,negative
he meets a woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typicallystimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his archrival another marine d i,negative
webb marches over to the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of a dame do you think you are,negative
bogart he aint,negative
the other d i,negative
gets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses to the girl hes a damn good d i,negative
i guess im just a little jealous,negative
join the club were all jealous of jack webbs way with women which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment a lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display,negative
you expect me to talk to you,negative
in here he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras,negative
the woman goes off to help a customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen,negative
a little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here youre a man arent you,negative
he doesnt reply but you know hes thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small,negative
must be one of those children everyones been talking about,negative
this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions hes responsible for,negative
the movie doesnt focus too closely on webbs romance it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills,negative
after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed a male or female,negative
owens replies a male sir,negative
webb yells to the platoon this aint the one,negative
that such a scene along with the rest of the movie was intended to be taken seriously defies comment,negative
but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century,negative
webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie with the exception of owens were played by actual marines,negative
someone wanting to parody this movie couldnt do a more comical job than webb did,negative
it makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself,negative
theres a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter,negative
webb bursts in the room and shouts what did i tell you about laughing,negative
to which the private replies sir only nineyearold girls laugh sir,negative
and let me tell you i was as happy as a nineyear old girl while watching this movie,negative
call hush stop or my mom will kill,negative
or mommy fearest,negative
or the hand that robs the cradle,negative
call it whatever you want but certainly dont see it unless youre in desperate need of a bad movieinduced chuckle hush scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure,negative
chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent postproduction tinkering it was supposed to open about a year ago the latter of which appears to have given hush a sendoff thats downright infuriating,negative
its too bad that hush is so laughable because the onscreen talent including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange is nothing to laugh at,negative
paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy welltodo familys horse kilronan,negative
jacksons mother martha lange runs kilronan all by herself and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether caught redhanded after a bedroom romp with her husbandtobe,negative
but it seems that marthas friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor shes what youd call someone who loves too much,negative
martha eagerly deviously wants a grandchild and then helen will be expendable as far as shes concerned,negative
if theres one reason to catch hush its lange,negative
she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated injecting martha poorly written though she may be with a little empathy to level out the psychoplaying field,negative
when she delves into marthas dark side predictable cliches chainsmoking staring in mirrors praying in a confessional to a priest who isnt there poking a hole in helens diaphragm so shell become pregnant and she does abound but its moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch,negative
veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jacksons wheelchairbound paternal grandmother,negative
the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable especially paltrow,negative
but can you really blame them,negative
the character relationships in hush hold a certain amount of promise at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity,negative
idiotic situations martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over compliment idiotic dialogue why did you yell,negative
helen yells back at martha and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blankfromhell flicks ever made,negative
you can see through a great deal of marthas actions and lies from their conception why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out,negative
does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town,negative
if any of her potential victims thought acted or behaved like normal people hush would be a really short movie,negative
and then theres the climax and ending which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a laborinducing drug normally used on horses,negative
after a really weird chase scene martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself,negative
i wont spoil what happens next except to say that its contradictory illogical and probably since im no doctor medically impossible,negative
the final scene offers no closure no resolution no confrontation whatsoever,negative
its just there dangling amidst silent displeasure,negative
no one should like this ending regardless of their feelings on the preceding material,negative
perhaps hush s title is a plea to silence its audiences likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater,negative
i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series,negative
if theres a will theres a way and i believe that anything no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon,negative
this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sants universally panned update of psycho i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience but also very onpar with an original,negative
but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad,negative
you see the point of a remake is or at least it should be to iron out the originals flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection,negative
but what if the source material on which the remake is based isnt any good to begin with,negative
that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad,negative
ive only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based and to be honest i didnt like it all that much,negative
it has a concept that and still is interesting a group of corrupt young adults all in their early 20s are given a choice they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed or they can become undercover cops helping the police get into places that they normally wouldnt be able to access,negative
obviously all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen and policewomen,negative
the three main characters here are played by claire danes omar epps and giovanni ribisi,negative
of the three only danes has a real character,negative
ribisis dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs epps slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes,negative
when the squads superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death the three of them sure that their beloved master was framed go off and investigate on their own discovering corrupt cops lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations,negative
all kinds of good stuff,negative
the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments,negative
although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie his man here is really rather amusing when the script gives him a chance,negative
epps straight man is effectively played against ribisis clueless spontaneity,negative
but the rest of the film is dull boring and singularly uninteresting,negative
a drugop action plot is no longer anything new not even with teenage action heroes and the way its executed here its also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful,negative
claire danes character has potential but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained,negative
she could have been a tourdeforce but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role,negative
epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected although their characters arent nearly as rich as danes could have been,negative
the mod squad is a mindnumbing marketing plot of a film and teens will jump all over it,negative
its full of bad dialogue scenes and concepts that make no sense and get this drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time,negative
nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for,negative
claire danes is no longer alluring mainly because shes got a horrible hairdo so that draw is out,negative
there are however cool explosions guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort,negative
do not be fooled,negative
some may call this escapist fare i call it escapeasquicklyasyoucan fare,negative
its tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city,negative
just ask mr furious ben stiller the blue raja hank azaria and the shoveler william h macy,negative
theyre trying to break into the biz but captain amazing greg kinnear the citys hero numero uno hogs all the action,negative
the good captain has his own problems,negative
because hes all but eliminated crime amazings endorsement deals are falling through,negative
the public craves a major slugfest so amazing engineers the parole of his onetime arch enemy casanova frankenstein geoffrey rush,negative
frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations he captures capt amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city,negative
so no one is left to save the day but our wouldbe superheroes but their abilities are more little league than justice league,negative
the raja hurls forks at foes the shoveler hits them with a shovel and mr furious just yells at people stiller is doing essentially the same character he played in a guest appearance on friends,negative
after a painful first strike the guys hold auditions for teammates and add the bowler janeane garofalo who carries her dead fathers skull in her bowling ball invisible boy kel mitchell who can only use his powers when no one is looking at him the spleen paul reubens who blows devastating winds from his rear and the sphinx wes studi a mysterious figure who will teach them to fight,negative
mystery men boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled,negative
in addition to those already mentioned the credits include lena olin as frankensteins evil shrink comedian eddie izzard and the fugees prakazrel michel as discothemed thugs singer tom waits as an inventor of superhero weapons artie lange from mad tv as another thug claire forlani from meet joe black as a waitress mr furious is pursuing louise lasser from mary hartman mary hartman as the blue rajas mother and ricky jay as capt amazings manager,negative
the cast includes four oscarnominated actors,negative
when i saw the list of players early last year i figured the result would be a cantmiss comedy,negative
yet i must report disappointment,negative
the script is probably the worst of 1999,negative
nearly every joke misfires,negative
the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny,negative
for example no one can recognize capt amazing in his secret identity because hes wearing glasses,negative
the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work,negative
the cast tries hard especially hank azaria whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume but the script is just too lame to run,negative
200 cigarettes takes place on new years eve 1981,negative
monica played by martha plimpton is having a huge new years party,negative
everyone in town is trying to get there but some are caught up in other things,negative
this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes,negative
as we meet the characters headed towards the party we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal and not interesting at all,negative
this disappointed me greatly,negative
the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion,negative
lucy played by courtney love is with kevin played by paul rudd,negative
the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship but starts to blossom into something more than that,negative
this subplot is extremely boring and dull and i am getting quite sick of plots like that,negative
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot dealing with kevin,negative
she plays ellie an exgirlfriend of kevins,negative
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalos talent,negative
there was no point to it at all and it was hardly even in the movie,negative
when lucy runs into a bartender played by ben affleck another subplot is formed,negative
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monicas party,negative
at the bar he runs into two more girls,negative
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker but unfortunately due to the terrible acting of both of them i dont even remember their characters names,negative
ben affleck is a good actor but his character doesnt go anywhere so he doesnt have much screen time to give a good performance,negative
featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles and they are part of the reason the film is so bad,negative
christina ricci plays val and gaby hoffman plays stephie,negative
the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost,negative
they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night,negative
this subplot was alright but it was quite annoying with stephies accent,negative
hoffman did an okay job of acting but ricci did good,negative
she was underused considering she is such a wonderful actress,negative
another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy played by goldie hawns daughter and jack played by jay mohr,negative
jack is an actor who doesnt care about the girls he goes out with he just likes dates for one night and the next day he doesnt,negative
kate hudson is a huge klutz,negative
she gets herself into very funny situations that are the funniest parts in the entire movie,negative
they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well,negative
this subplot could have been used more mainly due to hudsons performance,negative
mohr wasnt good but he wasnt bad,negative
he was just alright which i didnt find acceptable,negative
there is not much to say about the performances in the film,negative
none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not,negative
the only performances that i can judge are christina riccis as always good performance kate hudsons funny role courtney loves mediocre performance and paul rudds annoying and overused performance,negative
i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr ben affleck casey affleck gaby hoffman dave chapelle and especially out of janeane garofalo,negative
the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes,negative
martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981,negative
the soundtrack is full of 1980s tunes ranging from i want candy to tainted love,negative
the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s,negative
during the film i often found myself asking the questions is there a reason to this,negative
is there any moral story,negative
is there a point,negative
are any of the events going on in the film necessary,negative
do i care what lucy and kevin are going through,negative
the movie is extremely boring and by the time they reached elevenoclock one hour before midnight i could not wait for the movie to be over,negative
the plot is okay but the subplots make it terrible,negative
maybe if the film was about the party not about the people at the party it could have been a lot better,negative
the bottom line just like a slasher movie this 80s comedy is just one too many,negative
poster boy for codependency needs patching,negative
patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman,negative
mediocrity is a pox on civilization,negative
in our heavily consumer oriented society there is an enormous demand to churn out stuff,negative
what would happen to our economy if we didnt feel the need to have more things,negative
to make us buy more businesses need to produce a ton of product,negative
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality,negative
the film industry is like any other,negative
in order for studios to survive they have to make money,negative
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit,negative
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that less talented people are used,negative
there arent enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary,negative
for some reason its never crossed anyones mind that the real equation is quality films more profit,negative
often mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones,negative
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies,negative
im not suggesting that patch adams was tossed out just to rake in the bucks,negative
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel,negative
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story but its as dull as could be,negative
hunter patch adams robin williams desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis,negative
checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around,negative
patch could be a poster boy for codependency,negative
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesnt focus on his own problems,negative
he decides that he wants to be a physician leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia,negative
as a med student patchs antics at the schools hospital catch the attention of his soon to be archenemy straightlaced dean walcott bob gunton,negative
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although hes one of the top students,negative
he writes in patchs academic file that he shows excessive happiness,negative
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing,negative
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies,negative
then it struck me,negative
it must be based on a true story,negative
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute a free clinic,negative
robin williams is an amazing actor,negative
while he is adept at dramatic roles his forte is overthetop free spirits,negative
thats what makes his failure here so remarkable,negative
patch is exactly the character he should be best at yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat,negative
something holds him back,negative
most of the rest of the cast is twodimensional,negative
for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings its curious that the ones here are cardboard characters,negative
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person,negative
unfortunately hes in the film for only about two minutes,negative
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene,negative
were not left to our own emotional decisions were hit over the head with them,negative
shavedheaded children with cancer an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh a beautiful woman who cant love because of her abusive history,negative
when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy hey lets put on a play,negative
we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains,negative
mode they laugh and roll around while painting each other,negative
there might as well be giant signs flashing feel good now,negative
feel bad now,negative
patch is a good title for the film,negative
it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of,negative
the fulloflife student fights stodgy establishment types,negative
theres a touching death,negative
then theres another,negative
the film doesnt trust us to get it the first time,negative
the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again,negative
worst of all is the final courtroom bit,negative
scarylooking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people,negative
the room is packed with patchs supporters,negative
williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all,negative
it has as much emotion as his earlier statement humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species contains truth,negative
most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk,negative
shadyac also directed the first ace ventura movie,negative
oedekerk directed the second one,negative
need i say more,negative
the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases,negative
the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care,negative
the doctors are not gods theme will resonate with a number of people but its so poorly produced that no one will care,negative
as with any genx mtv movie like last years dead man on campus the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points sex and football,negative
those two items wrapped in a guiltypleasure package are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially but sales will decline for two reasons,negative
first the football sequences are nothing new nor can they be the sports genre isnt mainstream and its been retread to death,negative
second the sex is just bad,negative
despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the allnight stripclub party theres nothing even remotely tantalizing,negative
the acting is mostly mediocre not including the fantastic jon voight,negative
cultivating his usual sliminess voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer,negative
kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes twentytwo conference championships and two state titles in thirty years this year he plans to make it twentythree,negative
unfortunately when his star quarterback lance harbor paul walker goes down for the count hes got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon james van der beek,negative
moxon leads the team through its last four games and then must cope with his newfound stardom the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie amy smart and other temptations that abound in footballcrazy west canaan,negative
most regions of the country are not nearly as footballcrazy as texas and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most,negative
similarly the set design is wrong for a high school setting the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms radio headsets which never seem to work however and instead require coaches to signal plays manually and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer,negative
these elements as well as the heavy drinking and carousing might be more appropriate on a college campus but mtvs core audience is the high school demographic,negative
this focus is further emphasized by the casting james van der beek of tvs dawsons creek is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero although he never manages to do anything with the role,negative
other stars are similarly young and unmemorable,negative
theres not much that goes right about varsity blues and theres not much to like about it either,negative
everything herein has already been done and if it hasnt the movie manages to botch it one way or another,negative
this is certainly missable,negative
mission to mars is one of those annoying movies where in the middle of the movie you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie all five minutes of it,negative
mission does give you payoff but when it does come its too little too late,negative
mission has some good ideas but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery dimeadozen dialogue and spate of good actors wasted in cardboardcutout roles,negative
im sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm,negative
glances dont communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end,negative
the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff building to its climax,negative
a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships marriage friendship unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap,negative
there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know trying is the key word here,negative
the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching but as mentioned by then were so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over,negative
great design good intentions but no cigar,negative
if youre not a die hard scifi fx or jerry oconnell fan his character is the only one who has some semblance of character dont waste your eight bucks on this,negative
and what the hell tim robbins died halfway through the movie in a stupid way too,negative
thats just unforgiveable,negative
the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment,negative
with shes all that and varsity blues behind us and several more set for release later in the year the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance,negative
however you wouldnt know it from the quality of the latest entry jawbreaker,negative
this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center,negative
the most popular and most feared clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma,negative
they have accidentally killed one of their own the teen dream liz purr charlotte roldan choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday,negative
now the three surviving girls must decide what to do,negative
it takes little time at all for the groups leader courtney rose mcgowan to decide to cover it up,negative
the ditzy marcie julie benz is game to go along but the cliques final member julie rebecca gayheart has a guilty conscience,negative
to make things worse another student the hopelessly geeky fern mayo judy evans greer accidentally discovers the truth,negative
the girls cover is surely blown,negative
not so fast,negative
thinking quickly courtney offers fern a onceinalifetime chance,negative
after a quick makeover fern is transformed into vylette the beautiful new girl at school and a fullfledged member of the popular crowd,negative
does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder,negative
or will this finely honed plan crack over time,negative
jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation and failing miserably i might add,negative
it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations but misses three crucial elements sharp dialogue witty characters and the muchneeded humor,negative
it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being darkly humorous if it wasnt shackled to its deadweight plot,negative
the films most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo,negative
at this point jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths,negative
but then all of a sudden the innovation stops,negative
the film becomes mired in the murderandcoverup plotting which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film,negative
in the film rose mcgowan fares the best,negative
as the manipulative clique leader she truly dominates every scene shes in not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this however,negative
its a character crying out for a better movie or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact,negative
jawbreaker doesnt quite know how to handle its semilikable characters fern and julie,negative
either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows,negative
the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters,negative
as their motives become murky and unclear the film finally falls to the point that it doesnt really matter who wins or loses since all sides have become equally detestable,negative
detestable is a good word to describe the film jawbreaker,negative
its certain that like the murder weapon described in the films title jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience,negative
underwater science fiction stays submerged,negative
sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman,negative
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents,negative
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered,negative
psychologist norman goodman dustin hoffman is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash,negative
when he arrives at the site he discovers that there is no plane but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years,negative
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship,negative
his group as outlined in his report consists of beth halperin sharon stone a biochemist harry adams samuel l jackson a mathematician and ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist,negative
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blowoff project for goodman who did it for the money and named his thencolleagues to the team,negative
after all he explains who reads government documents,negative
lead by harold barnes peter coyote a top secret federal operative the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel,negative
once there they stroll over knock on the door and explore the stilloperational ufo,negative
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere,negative
when adams enters the sphere the weirdness unfolds,negative
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer,negative
my name is jerry,negative
i am happy flashes across the screen,negative
this is unsettling for the psychologist,negative
what happens if jerry gets mad he asks,negative
barnes is more pragmatic he needs a last name because he cant put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry,negative
then the situation turns bad,negative
deadly beasts appear from nowhere,negative
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel,negative
lethal sea snakes attack goodman,negative
a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading 20 000 leagues under the sea,negative
the suspicious scientists turn against each other,negative
this has all the makings of a firstrate thinking mans science fiction film,negative
however even the finest ingredients dont go very far in the hands of a chief who doesnt seem to care about his product,negative
director barry levinson has churned out a mishmosh that doesnt engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes,negative
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification,negative
its much like speedreading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances,negative
it doesnt get any better when the action scenes begin,negative
while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles the people are still flat,negative
oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them,negative
after adams experiences the interior of the sphere no one bothers to ask him what happened,negative
their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited,negative
even goodman and halperins illconceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing,negative
her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing,negative
theres a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending but here they are far too obvious,negative
when an emergency minisub is explained you know whats going to happen,negative
the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting,negative
chapter headings that divide the movie have no function,negative
the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos,negative
much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow,negative
although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable a great deal of it isnt,negative
even a science fiction film must be internally consistent,negative
theres too much here that doesnt make sense,negative
are the manifestations real,negative
the jellyfish kill queen latifa in a throwaway role and the squid nearly destroys the outpost but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect,negative
a scene in the sub suggests that its illusion but earlier episodes indicate that its not,negative
not everything has to be explained to death but there are major questions that the film never answers,negative
where the ship came from is clarified but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to,negative
even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll,negative
the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale,negative
after prerelease audience testing the actors were called back to reshoot the ending,negative
its difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse,negative
following the recent tradition of lengthy films this weighs in at over two very long hours,negative
the weak scenes could have been cut but then there wouldnt have been much left,negative
the movie was supposedly held up by effects work but theres nothing special on the screen,negative
we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm,negative
stealing from alien the abyss and the disastrous event horizon this film has learned nothing from them,negative
remarkably levinson and hoffmans other currently showing film is wag the dog a smart and entertaining piece of work,negative
this one could have been titled the same sans one word,negative
jet li busted onto the american action movie scene when he stole the show in 1998s lethal weapon 4 with his wicked looks his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma,negative
it only took another two years for megaproducer joel silver to set him up in an allamerican movie primed to take over some of the empty actionhero seats left by alleged cokehead van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal,negative
would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts namely chow yunfat and jackie chan,negative
lets find out,negative
plot rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another when members of their respective families start turning up dead,negative
thats when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brothers death and to exact some of his own style of revenge,negative
critique three words not enough action,negative
simple enough,negative
not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay bad actors crappy dialogue and ohso many overthetop melodramatic moments,negative
and a romance angle,negative
why one must ask why,negative
i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences and jet well the poor dude was barely in the movie,negative
and i thought this was supposed to be his big break,negative
how bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kungfu fighting chops slap him in a few more scenes and give him more chances to practice his abilities,negative
what a letdown,negative
even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up empty shell of a film,negative
in fact i am sure that more time was spent gathering the hits for the soundtrack of this film than were on the socalled screenplay,negative
i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time,negative
the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldnt matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines,negative
but no save lindo and aaliyah who werent too shabby i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly,negative
and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15year old looking guy acting like hes the overlord of a drug ring,negative
what a mess,negative
then again i dont want it to seem like im complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway not the story,negative
well i guess thats what disappointed me the most out of this film,negative
there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving,negative
also as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt,negative
it should be seamless fellas not necessarily against the laws of gravity,negative
the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow but that simple creative touch couldnt save the rest of this films uninteresting plot movements,negative
im disappointed for jet li that this film didnt give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes,negative
hopefully the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor,negative
for now i just hope that for his sake the films title isnt a premonition of the movies ultimate fate at the boxoffice,negative
renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jeanclaude van damme on the action stars 1997 pairing with dennis rodman doubleteam and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick stylish and somewhat diverting action timekiller,negative
tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels knockoff but this time around style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous and at worst incomprehensible nor hide a host of truly lousy performances,negative
writer steven e desouzas fairly straightforward plotline isnt as outre as doubleteams strange yarn involving a secret think but it makes about as much sense which is little,negative
van damme plays marcus ray a hong kongbased sales rep for a jeans company who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchipsized bombs in hk product exports to the u s dolls electronic equipment and yes jeans,negative
its all part of some type of ransom scheme but all i remember isand i kid you notgraphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world bombs detonating and an hatwearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter,negative
which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout knockoff,negative
while all of van dammes films have its share of unintentional laughs mostly due to the stiff acting skills of the physically agile van damme knockoff delivers more than usual though not as many as van dammes embarrassing directorial effort 1996s thequest,negative
a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza i smoked that badass like a roman candle,negative
and entrepreneurship babycakes,negative
standing out among my favorites,negative
but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of knockoffs laughs,negative
van damme is true to laughable form perhaps even worse than usual,negative
early scenes actually require him to make funny with costar rob schneider improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcuss business partner and the sight and sound of the stillheavilyaccented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way,negative
even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug,negative
paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneiders cia superior and lela rochon playing an investigator for the jeans company spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode,negative
in rochons defense though her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs exquisite bone structure and perky bosoms the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage,negative
tsui picks up where he left off visually in doubleteam juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work,negative
here though tsuis visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise,negative
for each nifty trick tsui pulls off such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices there are others that are completely superfluous,negative
this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context,negative
for instance one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box,negative
as he puts his hand in the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen,negative
its undoubtedly an interesting visual but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something,negative
the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences but surprisingly those in knockoff leave much to be desired,negative
tsui does what he can to make something of them employing freeze frames blurred motion and unconventional camera angles but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza,negative
there isnt anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic mine fight in doubleteam let alone anything remotely close to tsuis legendary hong kong works but thats a given going in,negative
if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woos stateside success he would do best to break free from van damme,negative
before its too late,negative
if he continues his involvement with bgrade movies such as knockoff the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish,negative
that is if it hasnt already disappeared entirely after this fiasco,negative
the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence,negative
its not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it doesnt make a shred of sense,negative
and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film,negative
james foley knows a lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor,negative
but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train,negative
at least we have chow yunfat in the lead role,negative
chow plays nick chen a chinatown cop,negative
hes a good cop as the first few scenes establish and hes very familiar with chinatown,negative
thats probably why the powersthatbe decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg,negative
nick and danny begin by stepping on each others toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other ones life,negative
what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me,negative
im fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann,negative
im also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff,negative
im not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way,negative
theres also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father brian cox but it doesnt have much to do with the main story,negative
one of the problems as i said is that the movie doesnt make any sense,negative
i dont blame this entirely on foley because hes obviously a good director,negative
im more inclined to point my finger at robert puccis script which doesnt seem to be in tune to the way normal people act,negative
one scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because hes angry about his new white partner,negative
hes shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me,negative
in addition the film takes a bite into racerelated issues and never develops them at all,negative
there are a lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent,negative
theres also a considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents,negative
the plot itself never straightens out,negative
im not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated with them or what they do as a group,negative
the corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences,negative
the sequences arent bad but theyre not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen,negative
on that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen,negative
one too many id imagine,negative
foleys strength is clearly in characterization and he does a pretty good job here,negative
the scenes between nick and danny are very good and i actually got a feel for their characters a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together,negative
chow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is a pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep,negative
wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but hes still fun to watch,negative
i also liked the subplot involving dannys father brian coxs performance is powerful and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny,negative
but the film ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overlyfamiliar action scenes,negative
a complicated plot can be successful but the story needs to make sense when its over,negative
the corruptor never manages to make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally theres nothing left to hold on to,negative
summer movies are by nature dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money,negative
wild wild west the latest will smith affair follows much the same formula except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies,negative
will smith plays jim west a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses,negative
he is called by president grant kline to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing,negative
west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon kline again and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind named dr loveless branagh with a zany moustache,negative
before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair ill give it a chance with the positives,negative
theres a nice credit sequence the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye and the special effects are decent enough,negative
theres also a pleasant soundtrack,negative
buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes,negative
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest which is always nice to see,negative
apart from these factors though nothing else in wild wild west works,negative
firstly theres little chemistry between smith and kline who appears to be in it purely for the money,negative
one would expect zingers passing between the two none arise,negative
both of them plod through the below standard plot knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end,negative
not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment although he is over the top the material doesnt present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy,negative
therefore he just comes across as loud as obnoxious,negative
the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek who is given so little screen time its embarrassing,negative
she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body and be ogled at by kline and smith,negative
her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script and there is no sense of realism about the character,negative
the humour in the film is also very off,negative
will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black here not even smith could save the humour on display,negative
the script largely boils down to insults that arent very funny and oneliners that barely raise a smirk,negative
its also somewhat racist although it doesnt intend to be with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching and actually says slavery is good to save himself,negative
its not a funny scene and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably,negative
the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man in this case kline in a dress is automatically unfunny it isnt but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness,negative
theres also problems with the plot,negative
jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying and rely purely on luck rather than audience pleasing skill,negative
plot elements are introduced into the film and then thrown away just as quickly,negative
the main piece of the story a 80 foot mechanical steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive but theres no particular reason why it should be built,negative
why not loveless build a great big tank instead of an ungainly fragile piece of machinery thats just begging to be blown up,negative
director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them with some nice camera tricks but even this is missing from this stilted affair,negative
wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing but not much of it is evident making this film drag out even more,negative
its a sad thing when four credited screenwriters a talented director and a willing star cant make a film work and eventually wild wild west collapses under its sexist mildly racist unfunny weight,negative
for his directoral debut gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects,negative
but while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writerdirector the audience is left in the dark,negative
the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him,negative
he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars,negative
then he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their fiveyearold daughter,negative
raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valeries brother billy charlie creedmiles of stealing,negative
raymond then proceed to beat and bite him to a bloody wreck,negative
but these are the least of billys problems,negative
billy is a heroin addict on the downturn and it doesnt seem that hell last much longer,negative
billy and valeries mother janet laila morse is raymonds nemesis,negative
she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it,negative
she merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments,negative
if this description seems bleak i havent told the half of it,negative
this is not a cheery movie and most of the time its downright depressing,negative
while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end its not quite worth it,negative
there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose,negative
take for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy,negative
the film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything,negative
granted there are a few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us,negative
the actors do a fine job particularly in the central roles,negative
the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into,negative
the bad thing about an actor turned director is that theres no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices,negative
a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience,negative
oldman got it about half right,negative
there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of scream queen in the early 80s,negative
two of them were halloween movies but the other two prom night and terror train were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween,negative
the same god im scared theres some guy in a mask coming after me routine she did in john carpenters classic jamie lee copies here with none of the urgency or suspense,negative
terror train takes place on where else a train charted by some premed students finishing their first four years of higher education,negative
most of them wont make it to med school though and its obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains i wish to hell theyd put a radio on that train,negative
the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone even jamie lee,negative
from the beginning hes talking his head off he tells one of his coworkers think on this whens the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station,negative
as if it makes any kind of sense and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles,negative
of course the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it,negative
i forgot to mention the prologue,negative
its a party three years earlier with the same group of students,negative
two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge promising him hes going to get laid,negative
they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in noticing a form on the bed,negative
she says kiss me kenny and he kisses the body on the bed which happens to be a cadaver,negative
oh my god they killed kenny,negative
you bastards,negative
its a sick trick and one jamie lee wasnt let in on,negative
she still hasnt forgiven the guy as they board the terror train you asshole you cant have a good time without hurting somebody,negative
the killing starts before the train even leaves the station,negative
since its new years everyones wearing disguises a convenient plot device weve seen before and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no ones looking,negative
at least one of the characters says its a groucho mask when the killer dons it and steps aboard it looks like gene shalit who by the way would make a great killer in a slasher movie,negative
speaking of weirdlooking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene one of terror trains most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield as the magician who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music,negative
then theres his greatest trick getting laid with hair that looks like that,negative
for all its attempts at visual style and substance terror train is more lionel than amtrak more prom night than halloween and nothing really worth watching,negative
only diehard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield if he truly has any fans should even attempt to watch it,negative
and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse,negative
i mean when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station anyway,negative
terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car,negative
the disney sticktowhatyoudobest rule states that disneys animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at liveaction kids entertainment they will fail miserably,negative
this goes double for occasions when they try to make a liveaction adaptation of a popular cartoon remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations,negative
im still trying to forget,negative
that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget an insulting despicable and worst of all expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable childrens film,negative
it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes,negative
its films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects,negative
just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet his career takes a nosedive to hell with his role as john brown a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him,negative
he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush dr brenda bradford joely fisher,negative
but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer,negative
john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr brendas father,negative
dr brenda has been working on a gadget project which would make a halfman halfmachine superpoliceman to fight crime,negative
feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject realizing his dream of becoming a policeman,negative
now when he says go go gadget insert name of gizmo here he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks bang up bandits and mangle murderers,negative
in the meantime the evil claw rupert everett the man responsible for the murder of the good doctors father is building a gadget of his own a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john browns worst nemesis,negative
claw has plans of world domination which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile voice of d l,negative
hughley to save humanity from his wrath,negative
state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this 90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere,negative
had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect,negative
what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal all of the expensive amounts to nothing,negative
part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie,negative
can kids really admire a hero so goodytwoshoes that he screams hey,negative
you ran a stop sign,negative
while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle,negative
i think that todays children will respond better to somebody dashing someone ultracool,negative
they probably receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt,negative
in addition to the more complex complaints above theres also the simple stuff inspector gadget is boring formulaic and achingly implausible,negative
theres no feeling that the director really cares about his story more than any other film ive seen this year this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line,negative
theres a popular commercial for sprite but thats irrelevant running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects,negative
it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious thank god movie called death slug,negative
each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tiein slug taco,negative
slug on a stick,negative
at the end one of them asks what about the movie,negative
another answers well we dont have a script yet but we can bang one out by friday,negative
they probably could have replaced death slug with inspector gadget,negative
this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script,negative
its no coincidence that most good childrens entertainment these days comes from animation,negative
animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work,negative
these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless sloppy and impersonal,negative
the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products,negative
1999 eugene novikov137,negative
sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking,negative
take this film naked killer among its ingredients are heavy doses of violence rape sequences straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls coarse language,negative
but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended,negative
one word penis,negative
thats it,negative
in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is penis,negative
it really restores youre faith in the system huh,negative
anyway thats just a side point,negative
when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip cool controversial thriller,negative
what they forgot to mention was that it isnt very good,negative
the plot involves male cop tinam simon yam investigating a series of brutal murders,negative
while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty chingmy yau who after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father falls in with professional killer sister cindy svenwara madoka,negative
realising kitty has potential cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity,negative
however in the course of his investigation tinam who believed kitty had disappeared runs into her again but isnt quite sure if its her,negative
to complicate matters the actual serial killlers princess and baby who a former students of cindy and have been told to kill their old master and her new student,negative
from then the action ensues,negative
all in all this is not a well done movie,negative
the script is awful the direction all over the place the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor,negative
however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain,negative
the shoot out in the car park is almost woolike in adrenaline,negative
the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different,negative
let me put this way if you like action get something else if you like strong women in movies get something else if you have do decide between this and black cat for your hong kong female action dont get either,negative
even for curiosity value it just isnt worth it,negative
lets face it if ever the was a movie that became popular on its subject alone this is it,negative
be warned,negative
brit love story in the offing,negative
effeminate mildmannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite,negative
he is only just saved by prentice who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average streetwise punkinthemaking,negative
the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school,negative
they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas,negative
in that time prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable if brash and bullheaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets motorcycles and punk rock music,negative
karl on the other hand has grown up to become kim a drabby insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company,negative
chance brings the two together and love such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy is what this skewed little story is largely about,negative
if at this point you think youre going to get any cheap laughs with that genderbending theme see the birdcage to wong foo priscilla queen of the desert you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you lowlife deadbeat,negative
kim is a postoperative transsexual thank you very much,negative
a newborn woman for all purposes with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy,negative
personally give me those cheap laughs any day,negative
id rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft hearted transsexual love story,negative
different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it,negative
by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentices relation ship or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them prentice for example doesnt seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fightpicking beerdrinking macho kind of guy and kim for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story the film manages to lobotomise itself,negative
lightweight comedy as its doomed to be it couldve still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple,negative
but this doesnt either since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintoshs kim foyle and as either sex hes just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like,negative
prentice does though and thats never explained,negative
but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice the guy who never grew up and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks concert he should win that too that i guess theres no reason to explain why hes so screwed up,negative
if oddly enough you grow to like this show youll be wanting your happy ending and the film wont fail you there either,negative
snide underling at kims office gets her comeuppance,negative
misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his comeuppance,negative
the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kims apartment,negative
kims sister and her impotent sargetype husband kiss and make up after a tiff tv movie subplot with incidental juxtaposition,negative
and best of all kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers making prentice ride pilion,negative
awwww,negative
terrific closure,negative
happy ending,negative
but just what is it thats differnt for girls anyway,negative
if you figure that one out let me know,negative
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
book should have remained in shadows,negative
book of shadows blair witch 2,negative
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman,negative
certain things in our lives are inevitable,negative
death sorrow love heartbreak pain joy,negative
we expect these events,negative
we know theyre going to happen and some we even look forward to,negative
its part of the human condition,negative
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society,negative
as we near the fall election several of them are hitting us in the face,negative
politicians exaggerate their own importance,negative
our side is always right theirs is always wrong,negative
in the end voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares,negative
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money there will be a sequel,negative
even if the original story doesnt merit one,negative
even if the first film is complete in itself,negative
even if success is a fluke,negative
the blair witch project was made with a budget of 1 75 and exploded on the screen raking in huge profits,negative
the concept was brilliant,negative
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real,negative
the film itself was even more convincing,negative
the movie must be authentic,negative
why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen,negative
the first film caught lightning in a bottle,negative
the sequel proves you cant pour that old lightning into a new bottle,negative
you have to give this effort some credit,negative
it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids,negative
it would have been easy but of course it wouldnt have worked,negative
instead book of shadows acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release,negative
its a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel,negative
unfortunately it doesnt work either,negative
five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film,negative
weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives,negative
even weirder stuff happens,negative
some people die theres blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense,negative
while supposedly doing serious research the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation,negative
then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud very obnoxious heavy metal music,negative
its a bad plan,negative
the cast shows some early promise,negative
a couple is doing research on a blair witch book,negative
the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado,negative
a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief,negative
the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick the cute wiccan chick,negative
the first films unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods,negative
this time these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors,negative
theres not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason,negative
although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea its ruined by poor execution,negative
the followup to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie,negative
theyre trapped in an old big weird house,negative
they stupidly separate into various rooms,negative
there are strange noises they see scary apparitions and people disappear,negative
ever see this movie,negative
seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better,negative
the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore,negative
for a storyline filled with surprises its oddly predicable,negative
the blair witch project was a rare triumph of style over substance,negative
the book of shadows is a triumph of tedium over promise,negative
of course i knew this going in,negative
why is it that whenever a tvstar makes a movie its always a romantic comedy and then they say on entertainment tonight or something that they were attracted to the characters,negative
they were really original,negative
original let me give you a runthrough of picture perfect character a kate jennifer aniston from tvs friends a smart beautiful professional woman wants two things she cant have a new jobtitle and the love of her coworker kevin bacon,negative
her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls,negative
what does she do,negative
she invents a fiance,negative
then when everyone wants to meet him she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner and pick a fight with her at the end thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor defenceless female,negative
he of course goes along with it,negative
gee i wonder if they get together in the end,negative
ive seen more original stuff on the wb,negative
and better stuff too,negative
picture perfect also makes the mistake of being wayyyyy too long at 100 minutes and expecting us to like anistons character who comes off as a cold spoiled bitch,negative
the camera zooms in incredibly close,negative
it focuses on the closed eyes of a person presumed dead,negative
all of a sudden with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse his eyelids open,negative
the camera zooms in incredibly close,negative
it focuses on one of the characters desperately running for her life,negative
then with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse she bumps into the killer,negative
the camera zooms in incredibly close,negative
it focuses on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate,negative
all of a sudden with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse the doors swing open to reveal whats inside,negative
closeup thrillshots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear which is a pretty good sign that youre not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned,negative
rather you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that theyre in that you stop caring about who lives who dies and where the story goes,negative
instead you become more interested in how the characters get killed off,negative
the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray two couples and dear friends to one another,negative
during the summer just after high school graduation they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway,negative
suddenly without warning their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision,negative
fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again,negative
a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change,negative
relationships fizzle future dreams crumble and attitudes change,negative
but they can not forget what they did,negative
and apparently neither can someone else,negative
someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message i know what you did last summer,negative
the letterwriter a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens,negative
its now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before its too late,negative
while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects too much of its impact had to be generated with extreme closeups while the level of suspense was choppy at best,negative
there is so much more that this movie could have been but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills,negative
it could have been a clever whodunit but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders,negative
it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film,negative
it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime youre alone and you see shadowy figures moving about you dont walk towards them yelling hello,negative
once you yell hello you can expect an extreme closeup a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse,negative
its difficult to be in suspense when you know whats about to happen,negative
the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume but im not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks,negative
the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it,negative
nostalgia for the 70s continues as we see a revival of one of the decades greatest achievements the marijuana comedy,negative
however half baked doesnt quite run with all its brain cells and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more,negative
the plot follows the misadventures of four neerdowell stoners,negative
theres the groups unofficial leader thurgood david chappelle scarface guillermo diaz brian jim breuer and kenny harland williams,negative
kenny gets into trouble when while on a munchie run feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse,negative
when the animal keels over he finds himself accused of killing a police officer and facing a 1 000 000 bail,negative
his friends promise to raise money for a 10 bail bond but have no idea how,negative
that is until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor,negative
soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson clarence williams iii,negative
for a comedy the film is pretty humorless,negative
not that it doesnt try its,negative
just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat,negative
the four leads are nearly all playing the same character,negative
only williams stands out while still performing on the level of his humorfree comedy rocket man but that is because hes imprisoned throughout most of the film giving a much needed change of pace but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another,negative
to help out the film is packed full of cameos,negative
steven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another,negative
none of them work beyond the simple hey thats level,negative
in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle,negative
not as his bland pothead lead but in his second role as a potobsessed rapper sir smokealot,negative
granted its pretty much a onejoke role and there arent a ton of laughs but this film needs every one it can scrape up,negative
to top it off and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film thurgood is given a love interest mary jane rachel true,negative
her role is that of the public service announcement to inform us why doing drugs including pot is wrong,negative
her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the your film promotes the use of drugs camp,negative
the film would have been better off by sticking with the rebel tone it so eagerly tries to claim,negative
yet in the end it doesnt really matter,negative
watching the film clean and sober you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is,negative
senseless r marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life,negative
alas moments are simply that moments which are not enough to lift this above its onejoke premise,negative
granted that one joke is initially amusing,negative
when wayanss darryl witherspoon an economics major at stratford university hits some dire financial straits he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses,negative
after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm,negative
at this point the film sounds more like senseful than senseless but through some turns of the plot darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once essentially leaving himyessenseless,negative
this sets up some showcase moments for wayanss gift for physical comedy especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely hilariously limp,negative
but these gags and the gag behind the entire movie quickly grows stale,negative
once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses instead of exploring any new comic territory director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness,negative
wayans approaches each goround with gusto but by this point hes simply treading water for the rest of the films unfunny duration,negative
senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didnt strive to be anything more than a comic trifle,negative
however the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity,negative
darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cashstrapped family and this serious angle seems to come from an entirely different movie,negative
unlike wayanss last starring vehicle the surprisingly effective and serious the 6th man the emotional content of senseless is forced and unconvincing,negative
any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzlesdarryls romance with janice tamara taylor a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself does not generate sparks of any kind,negative
once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros comes to an end the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising bigscreen future ahead of him,negative
but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless his film career could go the way of his oncepromising older brother damon who is now set to make his comebackon television,negative
capsule lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness,negative
potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring,negative
claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze just to break the ice,negative
its a perfect example of what my wife calls an s f e,negative
movie where s f e,negative
means so f ing earnest,negative
movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing,negative
claire is one strained speech after another written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk,negative
claire takes two women claire and noel both writers and throws them together in the same cabin at a womenonly writers retreat,negative
claire wrights light comedy while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior,negative
obviously the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie thats all they do talk,negative
the movie sets up its microscopic plot with beatadeadhorseintoglue obviousness,negative
the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie a selfprofessed lesbian and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian claire looks like shes been hit with a sockful of wet sand,negative
the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance and claire looks out over the water reflectively,negative
ugh,negative
the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads,negative
all of this of course leads up to a scene of complete inevitability claire and noel in a scene that should have come an hour earlier because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about whats just happened,negative
we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone only how they felt about things that didnt even happen yet,negative
the problem with claire,negative
is not lesbianism as such but the leaden way its handled,negative
why is it that any serious a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie thats unwatchably boring,negative
the way this movie deals with lesbianism we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids,negative
many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better more engaging more creative more intellectually and artistically interesting,negative
look at john sayles lianna or the interesting and littleseen desert bloom both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire,negative
what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants,negative
ever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking,negative
these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous,negative
if its not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect,negative
hackers is guilty of all of these crimes,negative
to anyone familiar with computers the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you cant take it anymore,negative
those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web the internet movie database are probably aware of the section for movies entitled goofs,negative
this is the section for mistakes in the movies,negative
well imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed generally illinformed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology,negative
and truthfully this is onehundred percent correct,negative
the plot obviously centers around computer hacking,negative
more specifically it follows the exploits of dade murphy a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller,negative
miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting because if it were not for that who knows where his career would be now after hackers,negative
the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems,negative
he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old,negative
the film then picks up at that point an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer,negative
dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn angelina jolie cereal killer matthew lillard lord nikon laurence mason and the phantom phreak renoly santiago who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi,negative
oh and as a little subplot dade also tries to woo acid burn the only female hacker in the film,negative
really i cant think of much more to say about the films plot aside from what ive said,negative
its just a bunch of computer geeks no obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi,negative
thanks to this movie the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do,negative
this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list,negative
to sum it up hackers is a terrible computer film,negative
if youre looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world i suggest sneakers,negative
although at times it too may seem a little far fetched it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users,negative
hopefully this film didnt influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time,negative
this is your definitive hollywood movie extremely predictable following the basic formula a horrible ending overzealous writing meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wiseass character of which weve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly wasnt used enough here im afraid the film would have been completely unbearable,negative
in this film ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend,negative
while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her,negative
over money how original,negative
while in jail she works out exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition,negative
now she has learned about a law titled double jeopardy stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works,negative
now her po parole officer and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims,negative
skipping over to the acting the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress no offense she has been good simon birch and even very good to great kiss the girls at times in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better,negative
but shes terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying doesnt really add to the movie at all just takes away,negative
as id said jones was fine although he did not have much to work with,negative
he was much more of a supporting character,negative
which is fine and he handled it well especially considering the material he had to work with,negative
i feel this film had alot going for it,negative
originality not being an issue,negative
the acting was the only thing as i said keeping it alive,negative
the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better,negative
the action scenes were well made however sometimes out of place,negative
i was just left unsatisfied in the long run,negative
so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely overthought the plot has certainly been done before generally speaking the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones who if he had some more screentime could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating in my book anyway,negative
keep this in mind if youre in the mood for a good action film rent the fugitive,negative
d,negative
i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world,negative
and i wish that filmmakers would use commandments as a blueprint on how not to do it,negative
daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soulsearching in this tale of seth warner aidan quinn a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires countrywestern lyrics his pregnant wife drowns his home is destroyed by a tornado he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning,negative
convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant seth decides to break his and sets out to turn every thou shalt not of the ten commandments into a thou shalt and vice versa,negative
his wifes sister rachel friends courteney cox wants to help seth rachels selfish husband harry anthony lapaglia who tends to break a few commandments of his own thinks seth is a lunatic,negative
thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion,negative
taplitz isnt interested in treating seths tragedies as genuinely tragic making it impossible to sympathize with him,negative
composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds turning seths sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark quinns performance as seth is all wildeyed fervor without any genuine pain,negative
the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought with one through five dispatched in a fiveminute montage,negative
the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a highconcept movie plot,negative
its not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth,negative
corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seths false witness,negative
only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve,negative
even she cant force taplitz to decide whose story this is or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite,negative
by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience,negative
commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith and the loss thereof at all seriously,negative
i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad there would be broken furniture traces of smack and cocaine on the floor and a dead prostitute in the bathroom,negative
i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad there might be the same elements present,negative
coincidence,negative
poor kyle a meek looking jon favreau he is about to marry his radiant fiancee laura cameron diaz,negative
but before he exchanges his vows he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout,negative
but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get,negative
the prostitute has met a horrible though accidental death and drugs are everywhere,negative
the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time,negative
a surprisingly calm robert boyd christian slater who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where shell never be found,negative
although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases when they return from their trip guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends,negative
one is adam daniel stern he grows increasingly agitated,negative
whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way his blood pressure increases,negative
or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family,negative
another is michael who was actually responsible for her death,negative
he tries to bury his feelings but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well,negative
boyd is the doer of the group,negative
seemingly suffering from a long psychosis when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks,negative
kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to lauras demanding expectations,negative
then theres moore leland orser who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face,negative
the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy but it presents things in a manner that just arent funny,negative
drugs mutilation and killing your own friends isnt something to be laughed at,negative
as a straight psychological drama i could see how it might have worked as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimessick ways,negative
but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours,negative
if you do like this movie i dont think that i want to know you,negative
i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the smart play,negative
and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a weddingneeding fiancee,negative
but her talents are essentially wasted here,negative
its obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone,negative
but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless,negative
do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film,negative
perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semioffensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with a condescending attitude,negative
his shtick was marked by crassness,negative
in this movie for example when his girlfriend says that shes kicking him out because hes been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months he tries to calm the situation by saying maybe youll feel better after we have some dirty sex,negative
this kind of humor can only go so far but certainly cant go the distance in a fulllength feature,negative
dirty work is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically,negative
emotionally theyve never outgrown their pubescent years which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback,negative
although having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people,negative
if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart,negative
mitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with 50 000 in a period of two weeks so that sams dad jack warden can have a heart operation,negative
their idea is to start a revengeforhire business where theyll do your dirty work,negative
in the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot,negative
their presence is established but when a lessthanhonorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge,negative
by default dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material,negative
except for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call,negative
already weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction,negative
but whats really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor,negative
relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he says after getting beat up note to self theres always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like were just watching an elongated rehash of his notsoglorious days on saturday night live,negative
much like the television show for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits,negative
the rest of the story is just dead space,negative
gordie boggs arquette aptly cast as a moron as he is one and his best friend sean dawkins scott caan,negative
the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king a terribly casted oliver platt as he is everything they are not,negative
they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil ruthless promoter titus sinclair a wasted palitaliano in a role originally meant for reallife wcw president eric bischoff whose name was written all over the role,negative
gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him but a drunken ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry darryl and darryl,negative
they sneak him back onto wcw tv after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcws next payperview against his rival diamond dallas page,negative
if he wins king gets his title and his career back plus one million dollars,negative
wcw president eric bischoff knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw,negative
he was then fired and rehired two months ago but by the time hed left they had already been contracted to do the film and bischoff could not play sinclair which in itself is for the best as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor,negative
the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans,negative
he thinks of them as young dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real,negative
that is why he doesnt take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a payperview,negative
i have news for you eric no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isnt for show unless they are four years old,negative
this is 2000 you know not 1985,negative
bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic rockystyle film which it probably should have been,negative
professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light,negative
anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows documenting wwf owner vince mcmahons doublecrossing of bret hart will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble that it is basically a ripoff of that films storyline with the poor mans wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect,negative
you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince but any selfrespecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart,negative
all of these aspects of the film needless to say seriously offended me as a wrestling fan,negative
another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan,negative
wouldnt it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclairs insistance,negative
i hate that cliche,negative
the world wrestling federation would have made a better film,negative
they are the promotion everyone cares about they are winning the ratings they have better wrestlers and they take their fans into consideration and dont treat fans like morons,negative
so vince how about a movie,negative
jeanclaude van damme movies tend to be if nothing else a lot of mindless fun,negative
his latest film knock off skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is well simply mindless,negative
you cant really blame van damme,negative
no one i suspect has ever expected the muscles from brussels to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray,negative
and even his sidekick costar saturday night live alumnus rob makin copies schneider does whats expected of him although neither appear to want the role of straight man,negative
no the problem with the film is its direction,negative
the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible,negative
and it goes downhill from there,negative
five hundred characters it seems are introduced within the first fifteen minutes,negative
van damme doesnt land his first kick until after thirtytoo late for most action fansand by the time the hour mark has rolled around your jaw will be on your cup holder and youll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess,negative
director hark tsui whose previous film was the van rodman teamed double team films at such a frenetic pace that its hard to know whats going on whos on whose side and what the point of all this is,negative
faster than you can yell fruit stand,negative
were watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme,negative
when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a fourfoot eel while enthusing move your beautiful big ass the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre,negative
every now and again knock off will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishesinventive camera shots and angles wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below revealing cutins within the framebut they all happen too quickly and within such a furious frame of reference that theyre wasted,negative
if only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute,negative
if youre interested in the plot youre better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the onscreen shenanigans jeanclaude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with nanobombs hidden in cabbage patch knockoffs,negative
maybe,negative
with paul sorvino,negative
a more accurate summary would be jeanclaude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large blatant cocacola product placements,negative
the fact that the film is staged during hong kongs last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesnt figure in at all,negative
perhaps knock off s most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score,negative
some of you might remember the mael brothers as the 80s synth pop duo sparks their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action kimono my house indeed,negative
like the cheap jeans and pumma sneakers manufactured in hong kong van dammes latest is a real phony,negative
toward the bottom of the 80s action movie barrel lies action jackson the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes,negative
this carl apollo creed weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs evil establishment crook and relies on all the 80s trappings from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer,negative
somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs,negative
weathers is action jackson a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques,negative
speaking of one past criminal apprehension jacksons superior yells you tore his arm off,negative
jackson replies he had a spare,negative
jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane craig t nelson and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson,negative
after hearing what jackson thinks of him stone says i take it youre not one of dellaplanes friends,negative
not unless they changed the definition jackson glowers,negative
and of course it turns out stone is mrs dellaplane,negative
faux pas jackson,negative
not everything is happy in motown people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa,negative
its all up to jackson to stop it and his only lead lies in vanity not his own,negative
wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson,negative
she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplanes nightclub,negative
after singing one particularly sultry number for him she saunters over and complains i expected a standing ovation,negative
he responds youre getting one and its damn clever because hes sitting down at the time,negative
prince wouldnt even let out an innuendo that lame and hes the king of the horndogs,negative
or at least the prince,negative
its a testament to the 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie,negative
action jackson is another variation on the unlikely partners buddy action flick with jackson lugging junkie vanity around,negative
this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade and with the dialogue theyre given theres not much room for improvement,negative
my favorite is when vanity feeling the effects of drug withdrawal says i feel like my teeth are hollow my gums are made of dry rubber and someones trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head,negative
jacksons response is i think i felt that way once,negative
they called it love,negative
youll understand when i say watch this at your own risk,negative
serving the world for nearly 125th of a century,negative
with his successful books and movies michael crichton is doing well,negative
with early successes with westworld 1973 and coma 1978 and recent films such as jurassic park 1993 his films have been entertaining,negative
however he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere,negative
this 100 million mess by good director barry levison disclosure is dull long winded and a huge disappointment,negative
considering the huge budget the all star cast and a story by crichton sphere is majorly disappointing,negative
the film opens with norman goodman hoffman a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors,negative
however when he arrives he his told by supervisor barnes peter coyote that he is actually investigating an spacecraft,negative
along with goodman is mathematician harry adams jackson biologist beth halperin stone and ted fielding liev schrieber,negative
they investigate the spaceship find a massive sphere inside meet an alien intelligence called jerry and basically weird crap happens,negative
unfortunately something went wrong along the way with sphere,negative
the film starts off entertaining enough but throughout this very long movie it just gets sillier and sillier,negative
the film jaunts along from scene to scene never fully explaining what is going on,negative
the actors and directing dont help either,negative
hoffman is on autopilot and almost seems embarrassed throughout the movie churning out dull lines and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie,negative
stone is useless displaying no emotion and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman,negative
the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson whos funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere,negative
but hes hardly in it and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone,negative
the same goes for peter coyote who hams it up as the officer but is then killed off halfway through,negative
the director barry levinson who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure 1994 messes up with the drama and the action,negative
the drama scenes are quite frankly boring and the action scenes suffer from overkill with levison throwing the camera all over the place much like the godawful speed 2 1997,negative
the writing doesnt help much either,negative
although crichton is great with plots hes terrible with dialogue and practically every line in sphere is a dud,negative
the speech is too simple i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent,negative
practically every line is just stating the obvious,negative
none of it is smart,negative
also where the hell did the budget go,negative
the sphere itself is impressive and theres a few nice special effect shots but where the 100 million went is anyones guess,negative
theres a giant squid attack in the picture but not once does the audience see the squid even though the film has a massive budget,negative
i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid and if handled correctly it probably would,negative
but the whole scene is done badly and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid,negative
finally the film has no idea what genre to be,negative
levison cant handle his own plot,negative
it leaps from hokey scifi to horror and finally the horizon psychological thriller,negative
and of course the film is very much like the abyss 1988 although in its defense crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released and is far superior to this rubbish,negative
its not all that bad though,negative
the plot is all right theres a few jump scenes although nothing very scary and theres the occasionally interesting bit,negative
but overall sphere is a big waste of some fine talent a lot of money and a potentially good movie,negative
not really worth seeing,negative
overall rating review by david wilcock,negative
the summer of 00 wasnt a very good one for devout cinephiles,negative
it offered no blair witches or sixth senses the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient xmen adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update,negative
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season that batterycharging at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o shit that moseys into multiplexes time of year when all those oscar contenders read quality films compete for audiences,negative
alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season,negative
its also indie director neil labutes first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture and im sad to report its a resounding failure at least on this web site a mess thats as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labutes previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic,negative
i went in expecting something decent for betty was gleefully praised its screenplay even winning an award at cannes but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment,negative
are critics so desperate for something unique that theyre blind to how derivative the particular brand of uniqueness betty dolls out is,negative
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written and he seems unsure of how to handle the material,negative
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men enchanting like the wizard of oz of which this film makes several allusions to and heartwarming like stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation,negative
its labutes half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesnt even seem to have half that heart in it,negative
nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict betty brilliantly played by renee zellweger who witnesses the killing of her husband del aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife by two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock,negative
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities,negative
shes blocked out her husbands death and thinks shes a character in her favorite soap a reason to love,negative
betty sets out on the road to la with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk searching for her soap boyfriend dr david ravell greg kinnear while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit,negative
the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men slipped a bit but not much with his sophomore effort your friends and neighbors then fell straight on his ass with bash a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime,negative
the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist only labutes persistence in wallowing in the horrid things average people do to each other usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are,negative
in the play paul rudd as an obnoxious jock delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim boys will be boys,negative
another character schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby,negative
what was once so powerful about labutes work the casual nonchalant cruelty and selfishness often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree had become so over the top it was borderline comic,negative
obviously at this point labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further but nurse betty isnt it,negative
he clearly has little passion for what hes doing here instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks one of the hit men is a huge soap fan and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadnt managed to transcend that tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience,negative
nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down as the two are made to enact softboiled tarantinoesque dialogue,negative
they evince little chemistry with rock constantly in over the top rant mode acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man an occupation thats represented far too frequently in movies nowadays,negative
i think rock is a great comic yet he hasnt been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies whenever he acts and no matter the part its like hes doing the damn chris rock show,negative
surprisingly at least considering her work in me myself and irene renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance building on her baby faced apple pie looks,negative
that wideopen face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirtyyearold body,negative
its the best work shes ever done,negative
freeman is effective as always though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it,negative
the actor plays the role in his usual calm collected manner though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and bettys suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality,negative
thats interesting but the movie doesnt do anything with it other than crash land the subtheme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle,negative
the film has good moments many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear especially his confrontation with zellweger an almost soothing lyrical score and you know a movies in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it but nothing jells its parts good or bad are so disparate as to be opposing,negative
the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film a mainstream female forrest gump or an oddball art film but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke,negative
bettys screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence without which betty wouldnt make any progress in the film,negative
nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter like how betty becomes a nurse in the film a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victims wound because she happened to see how on tv which leads to her being offered a room with the victims girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear a little too tidy dontcha think,negative
betty has an interesting theme though it doesnt even seem aware of this,negative
the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother with more on the way,negative
this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ironically reallife survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light,negative
instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the 80s than the 00s the film simply uses bettys delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation,negative
the following review contains spoilers,negative
please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie,negative
chuck dowling the jacksonville film journal,negative
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997s batman and robin,negative
apparently no one heard my words,negative
oh how i wish you had heard them,negative
oh how i wish someone had stopped him,negative
because hes done it again,negative
the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale,negative
in fact it was everything that 8mm is not,negative
in the opening minutes of 8mm we see private detective tom welles nicolas cage working on a case for a prestigious member of the u s government,negative
keep this fact in mind cage is trusted with an important case which he solves,negative
he returns home to his wife and new daughter and even finds time to rake his yard keep that in mind too its important as well,negative
hes hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery,negative
after her husbands death she comes across a film in his private safe,negative
it appears to be snuff film a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera,negative
the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film,negative
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film,negative
the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless,negative
welles is actually selected for the case by the old womans lawyer anthony heald an actor who always plays the same type of character that being a bad guy,negative
when you first see him your first instinct is that hes behind the whole thing,negative
the choice of casting does the film in,negative
then as welles begins his investigation at times we will see a shadowy figure following him,negative
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer or someone sent by the lawyer because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet,negative
so your first instinct has now been confirmed,negative
then when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced in one of those ridiculous since were going to kill you anyway why not tell you the whole thing moments,negative
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case hes told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended,negative
huh,negative
also when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing his main goal is to get the film back,negative
so why did he give it up in the first place,negative
the lawyer had the film the whole time then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film,negative
its totally absurd,negative
and this is the screenwriter of seven,negative
late in the film theres a confrontation between all the main characters and after a struggle one of the characters guns ends up underneath a car,negative
cage who has been handcuffed to a bed is rapidly trying to get to his gun which is on a table,negative
james gandolfinis character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of suspense,negative
you see the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car hes trying to reach it from and so instead of going around the car to the other side where he can easily reach it he just keeps stretching,negative
go around to the other side of the car,negative
this goes on for minutes,negative
then after cage gets his gun gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car,negative
boy schumacher is really really getting on my nerves,negative
i think the final straw would be when cage returns home devastated by everything that hes seen on this case and then is no longer able to rake his lawn,negative
we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard,negative
other things that bugged me about 8mm one would be the music if you can call it that,negative
whenever the score starts up it sounds like techno music and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it,negative
awful decision there joel,negative
another is cages performance,negative
at this point hes capable of a wide range of performances either good or bad,negative
for 8mm he delivers a very wooden one and only shines when hes interacting with joaquin phoenix who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case,negative
youre capable of much better mr cage,negative
now as for you mr schumacher,negative
im starting to doubt if youre capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema,negative
r,negative
shagadellic groovy baby,negative
smashing,negative
adorn the 14 page ad for this movie tabbed as the 1 comedy in america as of may 8th,negative
did we attend the same movie,negative
at 87 minutes it seemed overlong like a snl skit on steroids and at any length it seemed unfunny,negative
yes the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills and yes the concept dealing with a 60s secret icon played by myers awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy dr,negative
evil also played by myers in the present day had a great deal of potential,negative
fun costumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor,negative
dont get me wrong i like a good bubbles in the bathtub joke as much as the next person but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money,negative
but the way things work these days in the movie business all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it,negative
i do give this film stars because of the sets costumes and sadly unmet potential,negative
depending on who you ask the original sin was either the eating of the apple the act of disobedience against god or the act of betrayal,negative
but in case you didnt know this dont bother remembering it,negative
the words original sin never come up in the movie of the same name let alone the concept of it,negative
the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba circa 1900,negative
regardless of its senseless title original sin does actually have a plot albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war based on the book waltz across darkness,negative
boy antionio banderas places personal ad sometime around 1900 searching for a wife,negative
since this is a century ago we narrowly dodge a remake of green card only to find that the girl jolie faked her photo and is actually beautiful,negative
skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes getting the question out of the way yes we get to see angelina jolies breasts again the girl turns out to be a con artist swindles boy for his money and heads for the hills,negative
original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller,negative
we see boy go whorechasing saying he wants to find girl and kill her,negative
but as soon as boy actually finds girl instead of following what might have been a promising or at least not completely fucking boring thriller the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the complex since milk money,negative
girl toys with the idea of reforming her congirl past all the while avoiding the other man a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place,negative
add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect and acting roughly the caliber of a b b gun and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year,negative
dont even bother with original sin but if you do go be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal,negative
just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block its much worse than a sin,negative
this is sacrilege,negative
its probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre the matrix existenz would collide with the even more popular serialkiller genre kiss the girls se7en,negative
the result should have been more interesting than the cell,negative
as the movie opens therapist catharine deane jennifer lopez treats a catatonic boy colton james by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique thats never fully explained,negative
after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert catharine has no success to report,negative
meanwhile killer carl stargher vincent donofrio has claimed another victim,negative
his particular hobby is to kidnap young women keep them in a glass cell overnight and drown them,negative
he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning,negative
although carls been doing this for awhile hes recently become sloppy and fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn is closing in fast,negative
not fast enough though to keep carl from sticking another woman tara subkoff in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma,negative
from the videos in carls house peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction,negative
to save the kidnapped girl peter has to find the cell before the end of the day and comatose carls not talking,negative
so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carls mind and find out where the cell is in time,negative
the focus of the cell in on the ornate interior of carls mind but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computergenerated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality,negative
for the most part its style without substance,negative
in his own mind carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes ming the merciless as well as a frightened boy jake thomas abused by his father,negative
all in all the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place and i kept wishing i could fastforward to the next development,negative
singh is best known for directing music videos particularly rems losing my religion and the cell seems very much like a really long really slow mtv video with the sound deleted,negative
singer lopez seems to think shes in a video as well she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting,negative
the premise had great promise,negative
the computergenerated world within carls mind could have been a bizarre surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic,negative
the first room catharine enters in carls head shows this promise,negative
she finds a horse standing in center of the room suddenly sheets of sharpedged glass fall into the horse dividing it into segments,negative
the panes of glass separate pulling apart the pieces of the stillliving horse,negative
this scene is twisted disturbing and thoughtprovoking because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder,negative
another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath,negative
their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharines own psyche,negative
like sidney lumets the offence or michael manns manhunter the cell could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator,negative
however catharines character is hardly developed at all and lopez has no depth to offer the role,negative
bottom line dont get trapped in this one,negative
movies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents,negative
the script was written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas hed rehash a lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drugdealing pirates to provide for a few highlevel action sequences and explosions,negative
there are good scripts out there that highprofile actors can make see the truman show for instance,negative
six days seven nights is simply a waste,negative
lets see,negative
we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island,negative
so how do we do that,negative
well well make her a feisty magazine editor and well make him a crusty old pilot,negative
but wait she has to have a fianc e that can be david schwimmer,negative
but wait if she has a fianc e how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone,negative
i know,negative
theyll get to their vacation spot and then shell get called back,negative
yessssss,negative
so theyll crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minutes,negative
shucks,negative
oh ive got it,negative
well throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo and then he can feel guilty,negative
then when anne heche kisses harrison ford they have to kiss because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie it will be a vindicated action because her fianc e will already have cheated on her,negative
then for no obvious reason theyll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them,negative
oh yes,negative
i feel so good about this story,negative
instead of using characterization to propel the events it will be completely random and yet totally predictable,negative
imagine that,negative
dont get me wrong six days seven nights is not a boring picture ford and heche both do a great job,negative
the sparks fly between them and so most of brownings inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors sheer force of talent,negative
almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen and i found myself laughing pretty hard,negative
schwimmer is also funny and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get,negative
and reitman who has made some good films at least tries to make things exciting,negative
even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences,negative
its just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces,negative
the picture feels like its been hacked to pieces i wouldnt be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely,negative
the ones that are here are as bad as they come i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships and id just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream why did you pick this awful script,negative
the film is outright stupid but some of the elements are subtly horrifying,negative
for instance take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo and then feels really guilty,negative
this is a serious problem in real life but six days seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford,negative
in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story,negative
this is summer movie season but that doesnt mean our movies have to be dumb,negative
1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters,negative
when i was in line for six days seven nights i heard the woman in front of me ask for two tickets to that new harrison ford movie,negative
why didnt she know the name of the film,negative
i suppose she just didnt care,negative
what bothers me even more is that the people who make these bigbudget pictures dont realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves,negative
good actors should sign to good scripts and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash they least they could do is assume that wed like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents,negative
plot token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film trio from the studio after they complete the final cut without him,negative
he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision,negative
critique wow,negative
i really cant remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels,negative
the comedy in this film is pathetic obvious and dated oj simpson jokes galore,negative
the plot is uninteresting boring and bad,negative
the structure of the film is annoying repetitive and pretentious,negative
the acting is pretty bad especially jackie chan who cant act to save his life,negative
the cameos are lame and seem forced and the ending blows chunks,negative
all in all this movie believes itself to be a clever humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood but comes across as a boring stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite,negative
i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans but this one bites the big one,negative
see it if you like to watch really bad movies otherwise skip it because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it,negative
luckily for us all this mess only lasts about 80 minutes and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a leadfaced detective,negative
by the way is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldnt have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over,negative
who knows who cares this satire sucks the bag,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars ironically the original director of this film arthur hiller also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dgas alan smithee moniker,negative
this was after the films production company cinergi pictures preferred the cut made by joe eszterhas to his,negative
the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis,negative
eszterhas announced through the media during postproduction that cinergi pictures didnt have the money to pay for soundtrack,negative
he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him,negative
he received 9 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists listened to all that was sent at least a couple of tracks from each record and compiled the soundtrack,negative
this film practically swept the razzie awards in 1999 given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year with no less than the worst picture award the worst screenplay joe eszterhas the worst supporting actor joe eszterhas the worst new star joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer and the worst original song i wanna be mike ovitz,negative
as written by joe eszterhas,negative
some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others almost as gifted have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable,negative
as was amply evident after basic instinct sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon,negative
rejecting her natural abilities she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type,negative
gloria is her latest disaster,negative
babe ruth didnt quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity and neither should stone reject what she does best,negative
janeane garofalo for example is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stones part in basic instinct neither is stone any less talented because she couldnt do garofalos comedic roles,negative
gloria directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes was not screened in advance for critics almost always a sign that the studio isnt behind the picture,negative
after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened it is clear why they held it from the press,negative
it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed,negative
as the story opens an angry gloria stone is being released from prison after 3 years confinement,negative
shes got a bad attitude and a big mouth,negative
she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast,negative
an annoying child actor named jeanluke figueroa plays a soontobe orphan named nicky,negative
just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for glorias exboyfriend kevin jeremy northam nickys dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevins operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice,negative
be a man his father lectures him sternly,negative
dont trust nobody,negative
not no broads,negative
nobody,negative
most of the films leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements,negative
add in the movies almost nonexistent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones,negative
lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting,negative
they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse,negative
say youre my baby kevin coos demandingly,negative
im not gonna gloria pouts back,negative
the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites,negative
the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared no matter how many people are after him with guns trying to kill him,negative
and in one key scene the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied,negative
gloria who keeps saying how she hates kids takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys,negative
think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends,negative
if you dont know the answer you may be just the right viewer for this film,negative
you have to say this for stone she can keep a straight face,negative
when explaining life to a 7yearold kid she says with utter seriousness you got a lot of love making to make you got a lot of boozing to do,negative
gloria runs 1 48,negative
it is rated r for profanity violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers,negative
in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this frenchcanadian coproduction by max fischer,negative
the movie is set in paris where its hero struggling american author david mirkine judd nelson at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity suffers a terrible writers bloc,negative
he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle laurence treill,negative
unfortunately she hangs out in jet set circles which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous,negative
her connection with powerful david caravan pierce brosnan would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events,negative
although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller drama would probably be more appropriate genre label,negative
pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments,negative
low budget also becomes painfully visible and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film,negative
unfortunately this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed,negative
instead they would have to settle with pointless slow scenes involving nelson brosnan and laurence treills attempts of serious acting,negative
all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someones precious time,negative
there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs,negative
one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film,negative
two is never greenlight a scifi film starring john travolta,negative
to wit we present the disaster that is battlefield earth,negative
a sciencefiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild battlefield earth should be shown only at maximumsecurity prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior,negative
scifi is always a tricky beast tight script a good director an ensemble cast of decent actors and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs,negative
battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes,negative
heres the plot,negative
the year is 3000,negative
mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group,negative
a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the demons who dwell in the cities below,negative
the psychlos are stripmining the earth for its resources and terel played by travolta is the head of security for the base located in denver,negative
a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler played with dramatic flair by barry pepper ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the demons,negative
he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base,negative
after several attempts at escape johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terels involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end,negative
jonnie assumed leader of the mining slave group then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use,negative
then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry the bill of rights how to use a machine gun and how to fly a harrier jet,negative
the whole mess concludes with a big loud obnoxious gunandplane battle that had me praying for the end credits,negative
roger christian the director of this lumbering beast must have rented dune blade runner planet of the apes independence day stargate beastmaster the airwolf episodes the v miniseries the matrix and the omega man,negative
and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth,negative
christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie,negative
and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe really,negative
the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit,negative
travoltas acting hasnt been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect,negative
jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like you can have your freedom if you fight,negative
then theres the script the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and take back the planet would be a difficult task to achieve,negative
why,negative
because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt for no particular reason beside the fact that humans are stupid,negative
terel may be right you know,negative
humans made this movie,negative
she was the femme in la femme nikita,negative
he was the baldwin in backdraft sliver and fair game with cindy crawford,negative
together anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make shattered image the biggest piece of hooey since the thriller the specialist,negative
the film poses the question what if the life youre living now is really a dream and your dreams reality,negative
its either about a woman whos haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that shes a hired assassin or its about a hired assassin whos haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that shes honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica,negative
it doesnt much matter and believe me by the time shattered image runs its painful and pedestrian course you wont care,negative
these two lives with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig black emotionless eyes and black leather clothing in the seattlebased assassin scenes and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is its now twice as boring as it might have been,negative
its not that complicated plots cant be entertaining,negative
of course it helps if you have interesting characters crisp dialogue and a modicum of style,negative
shattered image isnt complex its just stupid,negative
and boring,negative
parillaud and baldwin who arent exactly shakespearean material to begin with are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines,negative
lines like,negative
you dont beg you insist,negative
i like that in a woman,negative
thats parillauds character talking,negative
to her cat,negative
and,negative
youre not the reason i couldnt care less about you,negative
huh,negative
and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film,negative
if you give me a couple of minutes you know ill charm the pants off you,negative
i dont have that kind of time,negative
talking of pants parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say point of no return,negative
we have come to expect this from billy baldwin but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first,negative
but theres nothing to learn,negative
karen is as interesting as a cereal box a someonesouttogetme crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone the stranger who sends her flowers maybe even her husband himself is her wouldbe killer,negative
siouxsie is the chromium cool toughasnails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the films meaningless stock title,negative
baldwin seems more interested in parillauds nest egg so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot than he does in her,negative
each time graham greene shows up he gets killed,negative
barbet schroeder reversal of fortune coproduced and should be ashamed of himself,negative
every now and again its fun to watch a really bad movie,negative
and every now and again as shattered image makes agonizingly clear it isnt,negative
apparantly money talks,negative
and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so,negative
ive always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess whether in language violence sex or what have you,negative
i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard and money talks definitely does,negative
its not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly and i mean constantly but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged,negative
perhaps if one character were foul mouthed but in this film everybody swears nearly every other word,negative
money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker,negative
franklin is your typical conman and ends up with more than one person out to get him,negative
when the plot finally gets underway theres no less than three people or groups that want him dead or alive,negative
the frenchman whos somewhat responsible for franklins escape from a prisonerpacked bus a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder,negative
franklins only hope james russell charlie sheen an investigative reporter for the local news whos out to prove himself a worthy journalist,negative
james offers to help clear franklins name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week,negative
both of these elements are completely lost along the way however and never do reappear,negative
as expected the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way,negative
there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film and so many developments are either nonrelevant or just plain forgotten about,negative
money talks is a paintbynumbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience,negative
frivilous dialogue a predictable flat storyline and twodimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money,negative
nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre frankenweenie beetlejuice batman edward scissorhands ed wood mars attacks,negative
yet none of them have been horror films,negative
sleepy hollow is his first attempt to actually scare people,negative
i greeted the prospect with high anticipation burtons whole career seemed to be leading up to this,negative
i left disappointed,negative
andrew kevin walkers screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story the legend of sleepy hollow,negative
in the movie ichabod crane johnny depp is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors,negative
ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders,negative
several of the towns leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman,negative
although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning,negative
he also discovers that the killings are not random that the victims are tied together by a secret,negative
along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching literally young woman christina ricci and the son of one of the murder victims marc pickering,negative
my reaction hohum,negative
the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting,negative
that in itself is forgivable hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages,negative
however burtons attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy,negative
it might be his background in his previous movies goofy was the goal,negative
along the same lines it doesnt help that creature designer and producer kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongueincheek tales from the crypt tv series,negative
a witchs eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbits a tree spurts blood like its in a monty python sketch and the headless horseman,negative
well hes a guy without a head,negative
on a horse boo,negative
the performances are also awful,negative
although hes impressed me with his work in other films depp doesnt seem to know what to do with ichabod and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction thats supposed to pass for an 18th century accent,negative
ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic which guarantees that we wont sympathize with her character,negative
the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish,negative
the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee martin landau and christopher walken,negative
i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppolas projected series of gothic adaptations a series that produced only bram stokers dracula and mary shelleys frankenstein,negative
coppola is an executive producer for sleepy hollow and the script reflects his interest in early forms of moving pictures particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion,negative
theres a bird on one side of the card a cage on the other,negative
when the card is flipped rapidly the bird appears to be caged,negative
bottom line the hollow isnt the only thing thats sleepy,negative
i dont expect much from eddie murphy these days,negative
for the past four years the gods of cinemaor the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerateshave allowed him to make one bad movie after another,negative
such films as metro doctor dolittle holy man life and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washedup hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures,negative
the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film nutty professor ii the klumps,negative
the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places,negative
sherman has just invented a new youth drink that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time,negative
janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor and for the most ridiculous reasons,negative
with love on his mind sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego buddy love from the first professor who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers,negative
with some convoluted mumbojumbo about dna extraction sherman extracts the buddy love link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handydandy lab beaker,negative
but one night the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated,negative
because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy,negative
then the klump family all played by eddie murphy step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex flabby breasts a slew of fart and dick jokes and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes,negative
and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster,negative
the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene,negative
pure and simple the klumps is a failure,negative
its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes,negative
any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process,negative
its more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade american pie have their names stamped to this trash,negative
hey guys quick note keep this movie off of your resumes,negative
the characterization of shermans family the klumps is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema,negative
everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough,negative
the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts,negative
the father is gruff is fired from a bluecollar job is sexually inadequate and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings,negative
the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone,negative
the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood,negative
sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to,negative
but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy,negative
the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct,negative
and you got the feeling that these crass people couldnt act like this all the time,negative
the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic,negative
after a while their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story,negative
its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line,negative
even the best effects cant seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days,negative
now that i think about it the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make,negative
people will be lined up around the block for it,negative
the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002,negative
eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles but hell play every character in the movie,negative
i just cant wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself,negative
in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures,negative
of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person,negative
what may be a disastrous situation for one may be seen as a challenge to another,negative
as deepak chopra is known to say its not the ride its the rider,negative
unfortunately clearthinking is not always the reaction to problems,negative
wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor michael douglas is a man with troubles,negative
hes sunk his money in illegal financial activities and its blown up in his face,negative
in a matter of days he will lose it all,negative
his wife emily gwyneth paltrow is a highlyplaced un interpreter and is not happy with her life either,negative
her marriage is cold and unfulfilling,negative
unknown to her her new lover david shaw viggo mortensen is not only a painter but an excon with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money,negative
emily is a prime target shes worth over 100 million,negative
stevens solution to his predicament is to offer david half a million to kill his wife,negative
the artist accepts and the movie is underway,negative
drawing from frederick knotts play and loosely based on hitchcocks dial m for murder this is alltoo typical of summer releases,negative
all style and no substance,negative
and theres really not much style,negative
director andrew davis the accomplished witness and bestforgotten other films has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn,negative
douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films,negative
mortensen showed promise in the past,negative
here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces,negative
the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman,negative
hes only onscreen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears,negative
the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense,negative
surprises are important,negative
in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen,negative
and nothing ever does,negative
nearly every event is telegraphed in advance,negative
closeup on this object or that action and its easy to guess whats going to happen,negative
as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile,negative
its a hopeless quest,negative
the story doesnt make much sense,negative
stevens wife is loaded,negative
even with unfriendly relations youd think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her,negative
when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice,negative
if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife would your first choice be her lover,negative
no matter how sleazy he is i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity,negative
why would steven plan the murder as a breakin in their apartment,negative
why not just take her out as she was walking to davids loft in a bad neighborhood,negative
while deciding among the numerous summer films you might do well to skip this one,negative
youll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel,negative
what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life,negative
you get martin lawrence in a coma the comedian thought he was getting fat so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat ending up in a coma,negative
so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies,negative
you get an audience in a coma,negative
in big mommas house lawrence plays a fbi agent whos a master of disguises,negative
when a naughty naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend the very sexy nia long,negative
the only thing worth looking at in this movie she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt big momma ella mitchell,negative
the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail,negative
however big momma is called away on an emergency,negative
sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal lawrence goes undercover as big momma,negative
and let the comedy begin,negative
big mommas house is the definition of a gimmick movie if there ever was one,negative
the plot can basically be summed up as martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman,negative
and even that description is too wordy,negative
you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it and all sorts of clich d humorous situations pointing to it,negative
fat woman plays basketball,negative
fat woman takes a dump,negative
fat woman kung fu,negative
well they left one off the board,negative
movie critic slips into coma,negative
paul giamatti private parts the negotiator plays lawrences partner and as much as i enjoy his work even he cant inject life into this lifeless comedy,negative
hell the greatest performers on the planet couldnt make this material work,negative
its just that awful,negative
before the remake of psycho appears weve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film dial m for murder,negative
as usual hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing,negative
the film opens with emily paltrow and david viggo mortensen having fun in an loft apartment,negative
the problem is paltrow is married to stephen douglas who is not too happy when he discovers this affair,negative
if i was paltrow though id definitely go with mortensen,negative
less wrinkles,negative
anyhow stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition hell pay him to kill his lovely wife,negative
mortensen agrees but the murder goes awry and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses,negative
unfortunately the film dosent progress very fast,negative
in fact it moves like a tortoise with arthritis read very very slow,negative
the plot moves nowhere fast and only becomes exciting in very short bursts,negative
not too good for a thriller,negative
also the performances apart from douglas are below par,negative
paltrow showing immense talent in se7en 1995 and sliding doors 1997 is strangely stilted even unconvincing in this movie,negative
mortensen is a little bit better coming across as a younger douglas but his role isnt meaty enough to show all his talent,negative
which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film which is does,negative
however i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking drinking womanizer with a creepy underside,negative
also popping up in the film is david suchet playing a shifty looking detective,negative
again its not a character were seeing on the screen its david suchet,negative
the director who bought us the fugitive piles on all the flash techniques such as zoomins quick cuts etc the lighting is also interesting,negative
however looks cant save this film from the depths of mediocre and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway,negative
the screenplay is o k but theres some hackneyed subplot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street again and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched,negative
the characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel,negative
with a combination of no tension drama or decent characters a perfect murder is a failure all round and an incredible disappointment,negative
there are a few bright moments but they are far and few between,negative
the last thing a thriller should be is boring and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas you wouldnt be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder,negative
overall rating,negative
review by david wilcock 1998,negative
you know for kids norville barnes,negative
the best thing about lake placid is that its only 80 minutes long and when its over youre glad that you didnt waste more than an hour and a half of your time,negative
its nothing more than a bad ripoff of jaws and i think thats being kind,negative
it was written by david e kelly ally mcbeal as a horrorcomedy but fails at both miserably,negative
i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once,negative
the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in anaconda,negative
the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine,negative
that brings the local sheriff brendan gleeson and a fishandgame warden bill pulman to investigate,negative
also a paleontologist bridget fonda from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric lover oliver platt flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast,negative
soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it,negative
theres also an eccentric old lady betty white who lives by the lake and has a few secrets,negative
as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor h20 dont go for a serious approach towards the material but they also dont have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either,negative
the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting theyre all basically idiots,negative
if they had any brains the croc wouldnt have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldnt have put themselves in half of the situations that they did,negative
but then again if they were smart there wouldnt be a movie,negative
basically lake placid is best undiscovered,negative
theres a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book screenwriting made easy,negative
this is funny the first time just cause it is but funnier as the film goes on since its totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it outlined it and then wrote this film,negative
its like they took the subgenre of the disaster pic which can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them the stupid eccentric characters,negative
yes the poseidon adventure is crap but its fun cause of all the stupid eccentric characters,negative
and earthquake my god,negative
earthquake has got to be one of the worst movies of all time but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold,negative
volcano takes a semiintriguing yet stupendously inane plot a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops only,negative
its in dare i say it,negative
l a and then puts no stupid stereotypical eccentric characters in it,negative
theyre just stupid,negative
and the actors are all good ones,negative
tommy lee jones is great an oscar winner and a member of the men in black my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer,negative
anne heche is a good indy actress,negative
don cheadle stole the disappointing devil in a blue dress from denzels feet,negative
and gabys one of the few good teenage actors,negative
but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at whats going on,negative
they do their best god bless them but theyre all lost in the fake magma only don cheadle gets an interesting part and hes the greatest part of the film,negative
theres no real suspense here cause you dont care about anyone,negative
i actually was rooting for gabys character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldnt have to keep saving her he did it like thirty times,negative
and there are no interesting sites in l a that we see get destroyed,negative
part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever,negative
in independence day the best part other than judd hirsch was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens,negative
that was cool,negative
watching really fakelooking magma plow down the street is not,negative
okay so the films not devoid of merit,negative
as i already stated don cheadle was great and the cast does their best,negative
and theres this really moronic scene which looks cool,negative
john carrol lynch norm from fargo goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it,negative
he has one guy whos wounded and could make it,negative
he could throw the guy and jump and still survive,negative
but no,negative
he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava,negative
heres the cool sight he melts,negative
heres the dumb part of it he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting,negative
cool sight,negative
no logic,negative
but cool sight,negative
the volcano erupts twice and for some reason the film ends there,negative
they arent worried about it eruting again they just go home to their toppled homes,negative
but to tell the truth i was glad they didnt go on,negative
i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended,negative
my god it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film,negative
i havent seen dantes peak but ive heard its a masterpiece compared to this,negative
if you want to see a cool disaster flick thats inane but interesting rent the towering inferno with steve mcqueen paul newman and the schweppervescent o j,negative
simpson he saves a cat,negative
if you want to waste your time watching a boring stupid disaster flick literally it almost grossed half of its budget see this,negative
but i warned you,negative
chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception instead of a speeding bus we now have an ice cream truck,negative
the truck is driven by arlo cuba gooding jr and mason skeet ulrich who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder,negative
this particular weapon nicknamed elvis must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees or else the shockwave will gooiffy everything in a mile radius,negative
that would be pretty nasty,negative
the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene as dr richard long david paymer conducts a test on an isolated tropical island,negative
long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance,negative
the commanding officer general brynner peter firth is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops,negative
upon his release the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down snatching elvis and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder,negative
protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ulrich and a feisty ice cream delivery man gooding jr who must elude brynners men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder,negative
all the while of course they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees,negative
this proves to be tricky,negative
among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a treecovered mountainside in a boat and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle,negative
they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing,negative
to put it simply ill use a clever pun chill factor should be put on ice,negative
director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie,negative
when there is some occasional action the audience seems oddly detached from it,negative
perhaps thats because weve already waded through a pool of clich s and boring dialogue all material thats been used before and with a lot more spice,negative
take the villains for example,negative
they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen,negative
they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint and act in very predictable ways,negative
the tagteam of gooding jr and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is,negative
frankly im not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man,negative
i suppose its better than him dressed like a giant hot dog selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner,negative
gooding displays one single emotion in this movie which is frequently on display in lines like im gonna get on yo ass like last years underwear and the incessant sputtering of oh sh t,negative
this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets,negative
but where gooding was once an exciting actor he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous,negative
at least hes a bit more captivating than ulrich who has all the films worst dialogue but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character,negative
the supporting cast which includes every personality you expect to pop up is also wasted,negative
to be fair there are a few brief moments of serviceable action,negative
and i did chuckle a few times,negative
one example is when ulrich an employee at darlenes diner is at the counter when brynner walks through the door,negative
you own this place,negative
the general asks,negative
yeah ulrich says,negative
they call me darlene,negative
these little tidbits of humor are mainly welcome in this weak disappointing wreckage of an action film,negative
as a speed clone it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps god forbid even some decent writing,negative
sadly i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been,negative
lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s,negative
yes thats right he cowrote raiders of the lost ark 910 the empire strikes back 8 510 and return of the jedi 810,negative
now with this film it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing,negative
and guess what,negative
he succeeds once again,negative
plot a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an openarmed swarm of people with problems,negative
it isnt long before he befriends the smalltown billionaire folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients,negative
critique this film is not a comedy,negative
it is a drama,negative
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer you would think that this film secures its base in humor but unfortunately for us it does not,negative
it is a serious film seriously flawed if you ask me but i digress which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake but overall just sits there,negative
now on to my review,negative
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst and certified it all with many a predictable ending,negative
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture but whatever it was he,negative
missed,negative
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puffpiece which on a good day might be described as predictably digestible,negative
its no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy,negative
it sucks as a drama and bored my movie cohort right to sleep,negative
ive given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks,negative
first of all i couldnt help but think about how much the lead actor loren dean looked like a young charles grodin,negative
he even acted like him save for the dry sardonic wit,negative
this kept me interested in watching him at least,negative
number two and this one is really shallow seemed to be geared that way as well there were quite a few titshots as they would say back in high school,negative
and god help me if i cant get enough of those in an aimless drama,negative
and three and this one surprised me the most actor ted dansons cameo yes he will always be sam malone to us real fans was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person,negative
a different asshole but a different person nonetheless,negative
if ever you rent this movie one day promise you wont throw away your hardearned money at the theaters,negative
wait for his scene because its actually pretty good,negative
other than that drab drab drab and drab,negative
even jason lee a personal favorite of mine was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while,negative
well at least he finally came out and did some real skateboarding in this movie,negative
oh yeah and i guess thats the fourth point in my rating,negative
anyway if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist this,negative
films your bag,negative
otherwise skip it and see analyze this 810 again now,negative
theres a great shrink movie,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars threes company fans alert,negative
terri from the tv show also known as actress priscilla barnes plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film,negative
the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage so stay tuned kids,negative
also it is to note that the actress was once named penthouse pet of the month in march of 1976,negative
she was known as one joann witty back then,negative
shes originally from jersey,negative
who the hell is loren dean the dude who plays mumford in this film,negative
you got me but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name,negative
jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971,negative
he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats 610 and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp hes been in every kevin smith film except for clerks 8 510,negative
listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince make a reference to the lost ark which is obviously an injoke considering that it is the of this film lawrence kasdan who cowrote raiders of the lost ark 910,negative
kasdan also played the part of dr green in 1997s as good as it gets 810,negative
ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdans 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt,negative
can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares suspense or even eerie elements,negative
i think not but thats what children of the corn 666 issacs return wants us to believe,negative
the sixth installment in the horrible worn out series is by far the worst to date,negative
unlike the other five chapters children of the corn 666 is a confusing brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror but either way none of these movies are the least bit scary,negative
the film follows hannah natalie ramsey a teen looking for her mother in gatlin nebraska on the eve of her 21st birthday,negative
what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder,negative
thats about all thats understandable in the film as after we learn this much issac john franklin who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter now an older strange man is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy,negative
and this is supposed to make sense,negative
really,negative
from the start the film is unclear of where its going not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film,negative
the film runs at a short 78 minutes but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours as the bleak slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 issacs return excruciatingly boring,negative
plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklins unbelievably horrible script as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion,negative
everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 issacs return namely writers john franklin and tim sulka along with director kari skogland should crawl under a rock and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash,negative
the bottom line horrible horrible horrible,negative
another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat,negative
and whats with that title,negative
the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film,negative
lets pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series,negative
one of the worst horror films in years,negative
were back in blade runner territory with this one conceptual artist robert longos vision of a william gibsoninspired future where information is the commodity to kill for,negative
front and center is johnny keanu reeves a cybercourier who smuggles data via a wetwired implant,negative
hes ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his longterm memory restored but first he has to finish one last dangerous job,negative
the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed,negative
hes walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins icet and dina meyer,negative
dolph lundgrens street preacher is in an acting category all its own,negative
without a believable performance between them all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere which is pretty good in places,negative
the vr sequences are way cool but the physical fxsuch as miniatures and mattesleave a lot to be desired,negative
watch out for those bad bluescreens,negative
we wouldnt mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better,negative
too bad the debut director isnt very strong in this de partment,negative
his big finale is a sloppy silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long which is way past the time that most of our wet wired processors have already shut down,negative
bottom line yatf yet another tortured future,negative
skip it,negative
humanities quest for knowledge never ends,negative
so a team of scientists and filmmakers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe,negative
the party consists of anthropologist steven cale eric stoltz and the camera team consisting of terri flores jennifer lopez danny rich ice cube gary dixon owen wilson denise kahlberg kari wuhrer and warren westridge jonathan hyde,negative
early on their journey they meet paul sarone jon voight whose boat is stuck on the shore,negative
they agree to give him a ride to the next village,negative
he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe,negative
very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo,negative
we dont have to wait too long for the giant snake,negative
she just had a panther hors doevre and now is looking for the main course,negative
our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard,negative
no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell,negative
our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp,negative
enjoy,negative
so much for the first attempt to catch her,negative
but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole,negative
our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake,negative
too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition,negative
one by one she goes after the others,negative
eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure,negative
the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned,negative
however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring,negative
whenever the leading lady shows up were in for a laugh,negative
the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an aweinspiring monster,negative
her attacks always follow the same plan one last hypnotic look shes looking at you kid then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down,negative
mostly we dont see the act of devouring,negative
but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part,negative
whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes,negative
maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real,negative
the animatronics are somewhat more believable,negative
but that didnt work for the strangling scenes,negative
dont go see the movie for the,negative
they are everything but uptodate,negative
the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team,negative
we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work,negative
a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation,negative
the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling anyway,negative
what kind of audience is the target group for this movie,negative
hard to say,negative
this cant be a serious horror movie or can it,negative
see for yourself,negative
if youre debating whether or not to see breakfastofchampions ask yourself one simple question do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie,negative
the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolphs chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the crosssection of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight,negative
everyone elseand im hoping thats most peoplewould be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess,negative
actually though the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle which focuses dwayne hoover bruce willis the owner of dwayne hoovers exit 11 motor village in midland city,negative
not only is he a huge success as a businessman hes also something of a celebrity his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials,negative
with a nice home and family to boot dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happyyet hes not,negative
his wife celia barbara hershey is perpetually in a pillinduced haze his son george lukas haas is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name bunny,negative
not only that the environmental protection agency is on dwaynes ass over a building development project,negative
its enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdownthat is if he doesnt succeed in blowing his brains out first,negative
meanwhile midland city is about to host a fine arts festival and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout albert finney a writer who is far from the renowned author the festivals organizer buck henry was led to believein fact hes a penniless hack who writes secondrate scifi that appears in porn magazines,negative
his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of lifes answers,negative
the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews but ironically i have barely scratched the surface,negative
i havent yet mentioned wayne hoobler omar epps an excon with an obsessive admiration for the similarlynamed dwayne,negative
then theres the matter of francine glenne headly dwaynes devoted secretary,negative
not to mention dwaynes employee and old friend harry lesabre nolte the one with the secret penchant for crossdressing,negative
and so on,negative
the film is essentially dwaynes story but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is,negative
rudolph does arrive at a point more on that later but its blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material,negative
the surreal visual style complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwaynes ears is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad,negative
the actors are called on to act accordingly resulting in some of the worst most overdone work all of them have ever turned in,negative
willis fares best of allbut thats because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience,negative
with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious and rudolph tries to make a statement,negative
unlike americanbeauty a film that breakfast resembles in more than a few ways to its great detriment there isnt any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift,negative
as such the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned and the film attempts to no avail to reach a profundity that it doesnt deserve,negative
vonneguts original novel is considered a classic but it had been called unfilmablethe same that was said of hunter s thompsons fearandloathinginlasvegas which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam,negative
with the similar failure of breakfastofchampions will hollywood ever learn that books labeled unfilmable inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable,negative
likely not,negative
if youve been following william fichtners career and theres absolutely no reason why you should have you might have noticed that hes played some rather similar roles over the years,negative
like sully in the perfect storm tough gruff and a little bit scary,negative
or law in albino alligator tough gruff and little bit scarier,negative
or colonel william sharp in armageddon or dwayne engelman in strange days or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of pearl harbor as the abusive father of dannyhere is an actor who gravitates towards tough gruff hardhitting roles,negative
which is why his performance in whats the worst that could happen,negative
is such a shock such a delight,negative
in the film fichtner plays a blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dogloving detective,negative
as alex tardio fichtners performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it,negative
it borders on offensive but doesnt really manage it,negative
and it borders on clich d stereotype but doesnt quite succumb to that definition either,negative
in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming fichtner isnt perfectyou can see him struggling a little at times concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personalbut hes pretty damned good and silly and without question the best thing in the film,negative
in fact had it not been for fitchners sudden and bizarre appearance and his jarring screen presence thereafter i would have walked out for whats the worst that could happen,negative
is mesmerizing in its awfulness a poorly written haphazardly edited and totally unfunny yes it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible,negative
moviegoing experience,negative
fichtners performance doesnt exactly save the film and its not like im recommending whats the worst that could happen,negative
solely on the strength of the actors dramatic turnaround but his contributions do raise the films rating from no stars to oneandahalf,negative
thumbs up to fichtner then and thumbs downway way downto everyone else involved in this sorry mess a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesnt even warrant discussion,negative
breakdown is an moderately entertaining if underwhelming thriller,negative
kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor taking the scenic route to california through redneck country,negative
however while in the middle of nowhere their jeep decides to break down leaving them stranded,negative
a friendly truck driver warren walsh offers to give them a lift to town,negative
although jeff rejects the offer he wants to stay with his car amy agrees hops into warrens lorry and promptly disappears,negative
jeff wonders where the hell she is and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife,negative
although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance 1972 and the vanishing 1993 plot wise the latter two are far superior character and script wise,negative
kurt russell is o k as jeff although he can seemingly only pull of one expression which is angry,negative
throughout the whole film he looks angry or just pissed off,negative
quinlan is o k again but again she can only pull off one expression which is looking dorky,negative
throughout the whole film she looks dorky,negative
j t walsh who sadly recently passed away is fine as warren who we soon find out is a kidnapper although his actual character is pretty weak and not really menacing enough,negative
the supporting cast do their best aswell with rex linn as a doubting sheriff and the other kidnappers,negative
the story written by firsttimer jonathan mostow who also directs is o k if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid,negative
some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy,negative
there are some flaws with the plot also as the characters do the complete opposite to logical presumably to keep the story exciting and also the fact that the story just isnt strong enough to sustain the audiences attention,negative
the picture moves along very slowly also,negative
it almost threatens to drop dead,negative
the picture does pick up towards the end but by then its too late,negative
mostow directs the action sequences well enough however,negative
the film doesnt really come to a satisfying conclusion either,negative
the ending tries to be bleak but just comes off annoying,negative
breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director,negative
instead it just turns out to be merely average,negative
a missed opportunity,negative
overall rating review by david wilcock,negative
from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which im guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it hasnt worked since the 75 million dollar movie has yet to break 5 million,negative
to each its own however since monkey bone is not only a bad movie all together but technically wellmade,negative
a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects,negative
stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone a crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder,negative
when stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in a freak car accident youll see stu goes into a coma and while in his coma stu travels to im guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life,negative
people are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them,negative
when stu spots monkey bone whom he really cant stand he tries to keep him under control,negative
making a new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life,negative
when monkey bone and stu steal a pass monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stus body,negative
now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or,negative
something like that,negative
rather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story,negative
what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development,negative
for instance we really dont get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care,negative
kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her but we are not given a chance to know her,negative
the cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body,negative
bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast,negative
dave foley isnt given enough to do as well as will graces megan mullally who can be funny,negative
the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust,negative
the special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes,negative
some of them are believable and some unbelievable for,negative
monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really dont realize that he is animated but,negative
on occasion it sneaks up on you,negative
the direction by henry selick is good but at times he doesnt know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff,negative
its too bad really monkey bone could have been a real good movie but with its heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role,negative
for those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one,negative
shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen,negative
it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies,negative
that is however not to say it is a good film a quality production or anything of the sort,negative
shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work,negative
the finest sign of this may be the plot in looking back there seems to be little more than a thin predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books,negative
philip henslowe geoffrey rush owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london,negative
it is at the peak of the royal theatre era and queen elizabeth the recently damed judi dench by appropriately enough queen elizabeth ii is very much a fan,negative
however to directly quote the film he has cash flow problems,negative
through a long set of events it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts,negative
so mr henslowe employs the young playwright william shakespeare joseph fiennes to pen a comedic production,negative
however the young writer has a severe case of writers block and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well,negative
he has the title in mind romeo and ethel the pirates daughter even that joke loses steam after a while but cant seem to put words to paper,negative
then as only hollywood could have it through a long set of twisted events he meets viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow and falls madly in love thus curing his writers block,negative
there are many other little issues that mr henslowe encounters but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing,negative
the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to its author,negative
ironically that couldnt be truer here,negative
the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors,negative
one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love,negative
so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a characters name in the credits,negative
the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeths theatres,negative
joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though,negative
he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad,negative
gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well,negative
however the supporting cast does almost save the day,negative
geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking,negative
they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links,negative
you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting no armageddon doesnt qualify as real acting,negative
and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well,negative
but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film so it remains plagued by poor performances,negative
when all is said and done shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained,negative
however as the film so kindly pointed out entertainment may be fun but it isnt necessarily quality,negative
and this certainly isnt quality,negative
perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work,negative
simply put it is farfetched poorly crafted but very entertaining,negative
after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball,negative
fiercely unoriginal director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him,negative
there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind,negative
the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars,negative
the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13,negative
interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 a space odyssey,negative
instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie de palma stops right there refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart,negative
mission to mars takes its first wobbly steps at a prelaunch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done,negative
during these surface scans of the characters we learn that jim mcconnell sinise has lost his wife,negative
its a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety,negative
the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability,negative
there is no contentiousness no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time,negative
maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff but in that movie the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects,negative
its the year 2020 and this is nasas first manned excursion to the red planet,negative
a crew led by luke graham cheadle arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly which they investigate with tragic results,negative
graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth,negative
in response earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell woody blake robbins wife terri fisher nielsen and phil ohlmyer oconnell,negative
obstacles are put in the crews way and and they matterof factly go about solving them,negative
i should say mcconnell goes about solving them,negative
time and again mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind which wouldnt be so bad if the rest of the crew didnt come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable,negative
mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crews mission and life is in mortal danger,negative
on a team of professionals she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link,negative
women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male characters personality trait,negative
by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush,negative
there is an adage in film to show dont tell,negative
mission to mars does both,negative
repeatedly,negative
characters obsessively explain the obvious explain their actions as they are doing them explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them,negative
the films conclusion is momumentally derivative anticlimatic and unsatisying,negative
as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film,negative
the best i could come up with is preteen age boys but in this media saturated era this films components would have been old hat even for them,negative
i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good modern day bmovie,negative
the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material,negative
i felt no such earnestness,negative
i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on,negative
im big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor and in addition i think chris farleys onedge extreme acting was a riot,negative
so naturally when the trailer for almost heroes hit theaters i almost jumped up and down,negative
a soda in hand the lights dimming i was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough,negative
i was ready to be just amazed for this to be among farleys best in spite of david spades absence,negative
i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran,negative
sadly none of this came to pass,negative
the humor is spotty at best with good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between,negative
perry and farley have no chemistry the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade for its his type of humor and not at all what perry is associated with,negative
and the movie tries to be smart a subject best left alone when its a farley flick,negative
the movie is a major dissapointment with only a few scenes worth a first look let alone a second,negative
perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie and not surprisingly the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley,negative
and farleys classic humor is widespread too,negative
almost heroes almost works but misses the wagontrain by quite a longshot,negative
guys lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark huh,negative
stick to tommy boy and well all be friends,negative
you think that these people only exist in the movies but trust me theyre as real as life,negative
i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual persons brain with microwaves,negative
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections,negative
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted,negative
these people had what are known as conspiracy theories ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public,negative
a little imagination goes a long way,negative
in richard donners conspiracy theory jerry fletcher mel gibson is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything,negative
his latest that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous to us but is all in a days work for him,negative
he combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goingson behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions,negative
upstanding citizen that he is he tries to convince alice sutton julia roberts of the justice department that the president must be warned,negative
lucky gal alice who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since,negative
what she doesnt know is that jerrys interest in her is far more than well professional,negative
he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment,negative
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerrys ideas and his limitedcirculation conspiracy theory newsletter he finds himself in danger and in real need of alices help,negative
one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an actionthriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action nor a significant number of thrills,negative
part of this is a result of the films slow pace,negative
it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over with the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement,negative
at over two hours this film could have been significantly condensed and had its running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour but even then the action scenes would not be able to save the film,negative
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces were treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite black elements black helicopter men in black action suits and body armor black vehicles you know the drill,negative
they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time,negative
big deal weve seen it all before,negative
watching the film i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination but i was out of luck,negative
now when i say it took forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice i completely mean what one person is relative to the other and not romantic involvement,negative
oh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring,negative
you see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies also directed by donner than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory,negative
the two just dont click and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether like finding out hes been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced,negative
the script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it then took it and forced it upon us,negative
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable to the point that i almost stopped listening,negative
even gibsons usual gift for ad lib couldnt punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest although one of jerrys theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing,negative
unfortunately much of whats discussed in the film is not inherently important to whats going on but instead filler that starts out with potential but ends up just being extraneous because its never followed through,negative
for example jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station,negative
he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break hence the water in a subway station and that the coroner should check the mans lungs for chlorine,negative
this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him,negative
you know what happens then,negative
nothing zip nada,negative
no followup whatsoever so whats the significance,negative
okay heres another one,negative
a couple of well known real life assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j d salinger novel the catcher in the rye,negative
jerry also has a bunch of copies,negative
whenever he goes into a bookstore he has to buy one,negative
leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin were never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin,negative
not when we find out about his salinger collection not when he goes to the bookstore not later on when we get the answer to our first question,negative
the point becomes totally extraneous,negative
oh did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film,negative
yeah he plays this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be a bad guy,negative
thats about it,negative
for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has hes nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory,negative
you can just lump him in with the supporting players with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi,negative
this guy was really likable and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time,negative
okay heres my theory,negative
this really started out as a great film but some of its jokes were actually true,negative
the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security and this was what was left over,negative
robin hood men in tights is another melbrooksproduced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein,negative
mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit,negative
unfortunately robin hood men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles none of the fun acting of young frankenstein is devoid of the charm of spaceballs and is even lacking the good solid dialogue of history of the world,negative
it is in short one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks or anybody else produce,negative
the plot borrows heavily from the wellreceived kevin costner movie of last year robin hood prince of thieves,negative
this is not surprising in and of itself and could have been used to great comic effect mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie,negative
mel brooks does not take advantage of this however and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air none of which connect and none of which are explained later on,negative
the movies scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice,negative
cary elwes of princess bride fame plays robin of loxley a man who was captured in the crusades fighting with king richard,negative
he escapes and joining with a man named achoo i am sure you can see the obvious joke fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard which has been captured by evil prince john played by funny comic richard lewis,negative
he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham,negative
a good adventure plot that is sadly unused,negative
elwes and lewis are both excellent comics but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating,negative
neither actor has any good words to work with and the lines simply arent funny nor believable,negative
perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone,negative
this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas that i really felt like leaving the theatre,negative
much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout and some left the theatre,negative
chuckles were few and far between and they mostly dealt with visual jokes such as an old beaten up horse from rentawreck then from any dialogue whatsoever,negative
scenes that could have been classics such as the archery contest are ruined by poor acting,negative
perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive,negative
the basic plot that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian is not witty nor funny,negative
mel brooks as a circumcisiongiving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience not all jewish either,negative
the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails,negative
the addition of a blind man who stumbles around falling off cliffs walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential but is also made terribly offensive,negative
the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard,negative
he is well worth waiting for if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue excruciating visual humor old puns ancient jokes and bad acting,negative
if you cant dont even bother watching this miserable film,negative
the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending,negative
watching one of these movies everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise,negative
when the film ends there is a moment of confusion then recollection then some more confusion then possibly a second viewing for clarification,negative
this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more,negative
good surprises make movies fun to watch,negative
then there are the bad twists,negative
you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie im talking about you reindeer games or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid,negative
screwed perfectly suits the latter description,negative
what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on,negative
by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs,negative
larry flynt scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing,negative
whoops,negative
screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments,negative
norm macdonald stars as willard filmore a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich old insidious boss miss crock elaine stritch,negative
when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day willard is convinced by his best friend rusty dave chapelle to kidnap crocks beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars,negative
too excited to pay any attention the hapless losers plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home,negative
now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends realizing they can make even more money decide to stage the fake kidnapping,negative
of course everything that could go wrong does,negative
the first fortyfive minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad,negative
but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear,negative
the more idiotic these characters get the more reckless the script becomes,negative
at one point i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters no you idiot,negative
im not just talking about willard and rusty who were extremely annoying im also talking about the cops in this film,negative
a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys headed by murder ones daniel benzali were just too clueless to forgive,negative
they give real cops bad names,negative
also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days,negative
looking almost identical to his penguin in batman returns every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief,negative
he just didnt belong in this movie,negative
macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was gross out humor is certainly not his forte,negative
if youre a fan of norm macdonalds other chaotic comedy dirty work you might actually love this nearsequel,negative
otherwise dont get screwed out of your hardearned money,negative
in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america,negative
i guess i was expecting some sort of political question,negative
instead i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind,negative
in america do wives and their mothersinlaw get along well,negative
he assured me in china that they did but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked,negative
even in china people seem to have problems relating to in laws,negative
perhaps some of lifes most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage,negative
a man trying to relate to his new prospective inlaws and viceversa could be the basis of a very strong comedy,negative
meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact however,negative
greg focker played by ben stiller has been dating and in love with pam byrnes teri polo for ten months and is now ready to propose to her,negative
he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbies family and to attend her sisters wedding,negative
from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes robert deniro and blythe danner,negative
through no fault of his own the airline has lost gregs luggage,negative
and he has to ask to borrow clothing,negative
it is the beginning of a game of oneupmanship in which greg is nearly always onedown,negative
as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes,negative
greg is playing a game he does not understand in a league he is new to,negative
but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his fatherinlaw,negative
this film had potential in its tale of oneupmanship,negative
it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiarone that has not been done overly frequently in films,negative
but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived,negative
too many coincidences in the story work against greg,negative
the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky,negative
certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him,negative
there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy,negative
certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written,negative
the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniros performance,negative
deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can,negative
the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities,negative
but we do not really see much of that digging,negative
ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen,negative
it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen,negative
but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that,negative
randy newman has written a playful score,negative
in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before,negative
there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s,negative
presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebodys imagination,negative
humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment,negative
but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me,negative
i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
when critics attack seemingly wellintentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry emails sometimes even mock death threats from those who i suppose like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment,negative
even politicians,negative
tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on goodhearted films while praising filth like pulp fiction,negative
these fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with tend to forget that a film critics job is to review the movie not the message however sweet and endearing that message may be,negative
thusly patch adams isnt a bad film because its about a doctor who cares for his patients its a bad film because its a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation,negative
similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place though i even doubt that stay tuned an explanation is forthcoming its still an unpleasantly maudlin mess,negative
the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world,negative
12 year old trevor haley joel osmet a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother helen hunt comes up with the notion to pay it forward this entails a person doing one good deed call it an uber favor for three others then telling them to do the same for three others and before long were all living in a frank capra movie,negative
meanwhile in a parallel story a weasely reporter jay mohr tracks the movement which has apparently begun to grow,negative
pay it forward has odd ideas about tone at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core,negative
its as if director mimi leder didnt have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended and compromised out of fear that her film wasnt gutsy enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for,negative
so the picture adds grit a child molester propositions trevor a homeless man returns to heroin after being saved a character is knifed while doing a good deed etc though it seems shallow incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isnt quite sure if its ready to buy into its own utopian blather,negative
pay it forward offers crowd pleasing elements for general audiences jay mohrs umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball angie dickinsons earthy alcoholic bag woman and the jivetalking black hoodlum with a heart of gold coming on the heals of the black godlike inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich,negative
hurray for hollywood who actually calls the mohr character a nigga and says things like can you feel me,negative
leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment,negative
maybe spikes flick wasnt so misguided after all,negative
these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that youll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings,negative
while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience,negative
its a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration with the main players all previous oscar winners or nominees given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns,negative
one scene in which a slightly deglamed helen hunt deglamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama hunts hair is also natty and badly bleached verbally castigates spacey feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip,negative
spacey of course responds in his cultured monotone that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance,negative
maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating though how can he not even when hes emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference,negative
the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender,negative
in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke and with said hand still on said mouth she actually begins convulsing dry heaving really then and im not making this up she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol,negative
the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blowups its all very theatrical especially hunts performance which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar,negative
pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldnt get academy awards,negative
the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists,negative
even haley joel osemt the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections,negative
his acting has become broader less intimate its as if we can make out the little munchkins thoughts boy this outta floor em,negative
naturally osmet is made to play one of those onlyinthemovies children a martyrfigure who cleans up after his mother lectures her on the ills of drinking and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher,negative
never mind that the two couldnt be more dissimilar his mother is trailer trash dopey and the teacher is one of those dennis millerey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary,negative
nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trapish cornball antics,negative
but oh how we love bright articulate selfsacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life,negative
theyre so adorable,negative
of course the blame cant all be hoisted onto the actors though with the exception of the little kid they probably should have known better instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er then went on to make two awful genre films in a row,negative
the first being the peacemaker a witless postcold war george clooney vehicle and deep impact one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earths possible demise by a crazed meteorite,negative
the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich s and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out apparently present for an invisible audience,negative
deep impact has more in common with pay it forward its a movie that treats earths impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days,negative
the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching,negative
in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal see my movie isnt as na ve as you might think she seems to be saying,negative
no its just horribly confused,negative
where do i begin,negative
okay how about with this starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time,negative
in fact it might even be the worst major release film to come out in years,negative
or even a decade,negative
this is bad beyond belief,negative
i would not suggest paying money to see this,negative
theres a good chance youll regret it,negative
if you see it for free you could still want to walk out,negative
go right ahead,negative
the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of buenos aires,negative
here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious easyto despise withapassion characters that have love triangles love rectangles and love hexagons screwing up their life,negative
before long they all go off and join the military primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined,negative
they train,negative
they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever,negative
after an hour of making the audience scream in agony they start fighting bugs,negative
the big bugs look nice even though their design is only okay,negative
unfortunately the fights are boring since we want all of the characters dead anyway,negative
cue more agony,negative
then some characters have sex,negative
then some more die,negative
who cares,negative
cue more agony,negative
the movie ends the audience runs out to their cars vomits over the pavement and attempts to drive home,negative
unfortunately after that torture they cant think straight dont pay attention to the road and many are in ugly car wrecks,negative
you remember how batman robin was bad,negative
well batman robin kicked this movies sorry butt people,negative
starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie,negative
it does not succeed as a drama,negative
it does not succeed as a war movie,negative
it does not succeed as a comedy,negative
it does not succeed as a satire,negative
it does not succeed as a parody,negative
it succeeds as being horrible,negative
terrible,negative
gutwrenchingly bad,negative
i wanted to run away from that movie every minute,negative
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better,negative
so i stayed,negative
it never got better,negative
frequently it did the impossible and got worse,negative
the movie as written acted directed and basically just feels as a whole like its about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4 the whole thing feels like a movie that only threeyearolds could enjoy,negative
except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore and pointless nudity,negative
its written for little children but children should definitely not go anywhere near it,negative
of course i recommend the same for everyone,negative
dont go anywhere near it,negative
verhoevens got a streak going now,negative
his last movie was showgirls,negative
he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming,negative
showgirls was a failure but it appears that though itll be lucky to make near its budget this movie will still do okay grosswise,negative
is it really all bad,negative
well no,negative
troopers has about four or five lines of humorous scenes that are actually funny mostly from the do you want to know more,negative
commercials that pop up throughout the story promoting the joys of the joining the troopers,negative
so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour 59 minutes and 30 seconds of miserable torture,negative
im totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie,negative
but i do admit it,negative
so if youre willing to possibly put yourself through torture go ahead and see it and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it,negative
i dont know how anyone or any thing could love this movie but hey to each his own,negative
feel free to give it a shot,negative
of course in the interest of saving your souls i dont recommend it,negative
but guess what,negative
alien resurrection comes out november 26th and having already seen some of it and having read the script i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away,negative
though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split itll be difficult to find someone that wont like alien resurrection when theyve seen it,negative
this is possibly the years best intense action film or at least one of the best,negative
if you really want to see alien warfare thats played out intelligently and seriously see alien resurrection,negative
please avoid this,negative
something is fishy in the state of universal,negative
about ten years back with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior postapocalypse nittygritty survival yarns became popular at the movies,negative
weve always had movies of this nature on the beach the end of the world damnation alley the ultimate warrior and so on,negative
to date the most smoothly done were straightforward haircuts of the classic western plot like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization usually one in possession of some critical resource like water feed range or a mining claim,negative
most of these grew out of venerable but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane,negative
my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn which was fairly well made on a small budget,negative
now we have waterworld which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter,negative
well shes not a widow and the kid isnt her daughter but you get the idea,negative
the lady is helen played by the stunning jean tripplehorn who isnt given a chance to be stunning or even interesting by the mediocre and unimaginative script,negative
the child enola played by tina majorino is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie she outshines her material all the way through,negative
in simple the scene is earth hundreds of years from now,negative
the polar ice caps have melted and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet,negative
the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies and survive by trade theft or piracy,negative
somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries and its inhabitants called smokers are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials so the bad guys have outboard engines and fastmoving boats airplanes and jet skis,negative
enola found at sea as a young girl has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back,negative
we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical dryland the place where trees crops and animals grow and what plot there is hinges on who has enola,negative
the psycho ruler of the smokers the deacon is trying to get her and find his way to dryland,negative
played with typical selflampooning rugchewing histrionics by dennis hopper deacon is the only thing in the movie thats close to amusing,negative
his performance is almost laughable but there just isnt enough there to be funny,negative
the star and a coproducer is kevin costner,negative
hes playing an unnamed lone denizen of the sea a man called the mariner who turns out to be a gilled waterbreathing mutant with webbed feet,negative
very little is done with this,negative
the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted much of the earths surface would still be above water and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown,negative
canned meat does not last for centuries ammunition does not fire after its more than a few decades old and so on and so on,negative
im quite fond of tina majorinos previous work very impressed by jean tripplehorns past accomplishments and still speechless over costners dances with wolves,negative
but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it,negative
this movie cost one hundred and eightytwo million dollars and theres nothing in it we havent seen before done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey,negative
at 125 minutes of material this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make,negative
the budget of this movie could have given us over thirty movies it could have paid for six years of a primetime sf tv series with expensive fx work or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx,negative
in sum this movie is beneath contempt,negative
it has nothing new to offer it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation,negative
if you have to go see it see it on a fourdollar matinee,negative
otherwise youll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface for weeks,negative
contrary to popular belief not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece,negative
some of them arent even good,negative
some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful un indien dans la ville presented as little indian big city and remade into that crap tim allen flick jungle2jungle and this,negative
what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick,negative
french twist the cool american title not the real one which was gazon maudit literally meaning twisted ground or something like that deals with a married couple with kids and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them,negative
loli and alain chabat victoria abril and alain chabat are not exactly happily married,negative
always on business trips alain chabat more than once cheats on her and she eventually finds out,negative
and one day she meets a butch mechanic marijo the co josiane balasko and they two kinda hit it off,negative
so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious sleeping with marijo,negative
but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo but shes also realizes shes still in love with alain chabat,negative
so of course she does the obvious from that she decides to keep them both,negative
shell be and sleep with each of them for 3 days each then on sunday shell rest by herself,negative
after all she needs it if shes gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel,negative
the film goes on for over an hour and a half through stupidity after stupidity moronic twist after moronic twist and soon theres the little ironic,negative
ending,negative
i know its a completely different culture and im quite familiar with the french and their cinema but this is just bad,negative
none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in fargo a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience,negative
whats shocking is this was not only one of frances biggest hits but it was nominated for a lot of cesars french equivalent of oscars,negative
the writing and directing is really the big problem with it,negative
josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role but her little sex comedy isnt very humerous entertaining or even deep at all,negative
even woody allens notverygood a midsummer nights sex comedy is intelligent wellwritten and possesses some depth,negative
this is shallow unfunny and pretty annoying to watch,negative
the film moves at the pace of a snail and is damnnear painful to watch,negative
thank god for the fast forward button,negative
the acting however isnt bad at all,negative
the actors do the best they can with the bad material and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script and the fact that shes stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids,negative
and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband,negative
but french twist is just pretty lame,negative
its not overly horrible and has a couple very very very brief moments,negative
but its just a really crap film and an example of an illadvised distribution of a foreign film,negative
onesided doom and gloom documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible,negative
orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he along with bestselling author hal lindsey discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent well for 1976 anyway events,negative
the film is dated badly as many things that are supposed to happen in the future never do,negative
for example the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth,negative
were still here,negative
the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kickoff the apocalypse,negative
were still here,negative
some of the more ludicrous moments come when its alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist,negative
also theres ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like,negative
if its anything like its depicted as here then its going to be incredibly boring,negative
the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video,negative
it contains the film in standard form aspect ratio of 1 33 1 although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed,negative
also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release chariots of the gods,negative
audio is mono dolby digital and the video is fair to good for a film like this,negative
i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me,negative
certainly i never expected a remastered print,negative
curiously the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case,negative
but theyre menu screens,negative
so who really cares,negative
pg,negative
when the haunting arrived in theaters all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects,negative
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department i dont think that they are completely to blame for this movies failure,negative
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and it was about as scary as a dust bunny,negative
so special effects or not if the story isnt the least bit scary you arent going to end up with a very frightening movie,negative
the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern,negative
dern is always great and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie,negative
as i sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects i kept wishing that this movie was about derns caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast,negative
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie,negative
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear,negative
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion,negative
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia,negative
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goingson,negative
catherine zetajones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects,negative
like the original taylors character is the star of the movie,negative
but since she doesnt quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms zetajones their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original,negative
and lets face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zetajones,negative
ill admit that i would have never seen this thing if she werent in it,negative
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets,negative
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients,negative
there really isnt much of a story here,negative
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with,negative
and the special effects are great,negative
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere,negative
in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shots quota,negative
at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary funny maybe,negative
but not scary,negative
then we have the set,negative
when i first saw the house i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it,negative
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route,negative
this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves,negative
what part did these rooms play in the story,negative
absolutely none,negative
they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie,negative
then we have the actors,negative
lili taylor has never been one of my favorites,negative
and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she comes in around the average or slightly below mark,negative
i have no idea why liam neeson took this role,negative
he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus,negative
his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him,negative
i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman,negative
zetajones was cast because she is too hot for words,negative
the fact that her character is bisexual is just icing on the cake,negative
all catherine has to do in this movie is look good,negative
fortunately that is something she does very well,negative
while she does have a fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eyecandy,negative
its too bad someone of her talents wasted them here,negative
any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role,negative
the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999s horror movies the blair witch project,negative
the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares,negative
both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film,negative
if the story sucks its all downhill from there,negative
my advice,negative
if you are looking for special effects go rent star wars,negative
if its scares you want rent halloween,negative
either way its probably in your best interests to skip the haunting,negative
this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st,negative
elsewhere for several years and i had understood that the had written for the show on occasion also,negative
i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations nor were they satisfactory,negative
if i had to list a reason why,negative
but that would be getting ahead of myself besides its not immediately clear as there are so many problems with the film,negative
adam arkin plays a gradeschool teacher who is sardonic cynical and somewhat abrasive but a good teacher,negative
he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court,negative
one day he meets a drifter david morse who plays jack morrison on st,negative
elsewhere in the park and inveigles him in a game of oneonone basketball,negative
morse turns out to be good and a friendship slowly develops between the two as their respective professions progress on the screenarkins teaching and morses selling of paper flowers to passing motorists,negative
so far my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack,negative
good music to be sure but it doesnt replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the storyit makes the film somewhat minimalistic a technique i rarely admire,negative
suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morses introduction to a fellow teacher of arkins a woman arkin has long admired from afar but it too reticent to approach,negative
it appears that she begins to admire morse who enjoys here attentions but isnt sure what to do about itshe doesnt realize that he is a drifter and knows nothing about his past and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else,negative
until then i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film,negative
the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a fullfledged failure,negative
the woman at least to me appeared to be fairly shallow i didnt realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse,negative
somehow this is made to appear as if it is arkins fault and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that hes gotten such a find of girlfriend,negative
frankly dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make punching her in the mouth not the least,negative
after this the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural,negative
if i had to summarize a major gripe its that this is a story spread too thin that creates semilikable characters at the outset and then suddenly jerks them into being 16yearolds at the last moment,negative
it might be truetolife with some people but that doesnt mean i have to like it,negative
i dont,negative
avoid,negative
an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer,negative
you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder its hollywood existence,negative
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film i picture a room full of monkeys,negative
the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves,negative
all of the monkeys combine their efforts hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clarks office,negative
the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clarks desk while flailing his arms and shrieking,negative
the director appears to be deep in thought until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims i love it,negative
the writing behind this project is embarrassing,negative
for your amusement i will explain the plot,negative
dr kinder kathleen turner and dr heep christopher lloyd are two of the coldhearted executives at the baby geniuses institute where peculiar studies are going on,negative
as the story goes there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ages 2 and under know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences,negative
when they move past this phase they become like any other drooling toddler,negative
kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies namely little sylvester sly for short who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission impossible team,negative
there is so much crap derived from this premise despite the fact its virtually identical to the plot in look whos talking,negative
a far superior film in any league,negative
you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene,negative
sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kungfu tactics,negative
question its obvious the babies are supersmart but why are they able to fight like jackie chan,negative
the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers,negative
its a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes familiar home alone formula,negative
i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90s knowledge quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors,negative
the effects in baby geniuses similar to the talking animals in babe are pathetic the editing is a disaster and the jokes are never funny,negative
the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are cute,negative
i suppose they are,negative
i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute,negative
other instances though i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script,negative
there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever their entire existence is based on punch lines,negative
peter macnicol and kim cattrall as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvesters twin are both miscast,negative
then again i dont suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid,negative
meanwhile dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench hahaha,negative
i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs,negative
instead of watching this i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling,negative
or perhaps you would consider going diving in sharkinfested waters,negative
anything to avoid this painful movie,negative
the final line in the film spoken by the bratty sylvester is if they think im doing the sequel for less than 20 mill theyre nuts,negative
sequel,negative
please have mercy,negative
the following review contains spoilers,negative
its just,negative
the way,negative
we are,negative
a rapist matt frewer responds to supergirls helen slater query as to why shes being attacked an example of the mindnumbingly bad dialogue in supergirl,negative
ill admit it,negative
i love superman iii,negative
i know its hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor but i still think its a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise,negative
supergirl a spinoff film of sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind doesnt even rival superman iii in terms of quality let alone superman or superman ii,negative
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time,negative
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in inner space go about their daily lives,negative
ok,negative
what,negative
so these are exiles from krypton which blew up right,negative
were they living there before krypton exploded,negative
how do you get to inner space,negative
this whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world,negative
how do they know where superman went,negative
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet,negative
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me,negative
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron,negative
one day the founder of argo city zaltar peter o toole gives the omegahedron to supermans cousin kara helen slater for use as inspiration in her art,negative
kara uses it to create a buglike thing which immediately crashes through the layer of whatever that protects the city,negative
in the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians to death,negative
in three days time or something,negative
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world,negative
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minorleague witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook,negative
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans and she sets out to achieve world domination,negative
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth and that shes arrived as supergirl complete with appropriate costume,negative
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives,negative
ok,negative
huh,negative
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake,negative
attention movie explain yourself,negative
im sorry i can only suspend disbelief so much,negative
i cant buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to,negative
knowing that she needs a secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into a school girl outfit complete with a different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school,negative
shes given her dorm assignment and who happens to be her roommate,negative
lois lanes sister lucy,negative
ok coincidence is one thing folks but were getting really contrived now,negative
what follows are some generic allgirls school hijinks,negative
complete with evil bully girls mean for no reason of course and even a shower scene,negative
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks,negative
at this point im rapidly wondering why im bothering with this nonsense,negative
there is some credit to give to the film however,negative
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its prey is very well done,negative
also its commendable to see genders reversed in the film whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools,negative
hart bochner die hard is particularly fun as karas love interest a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the films more ridiculous moments when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some menacing bumper cars,negative
then there were numerous little things that bothered me,negative
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment,negative
its all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires,negative
instead of having her look like shes flying the filmmakers wanted her to be graceful so she poses a lot and does ballettype maneuvers,negative
also who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth,negative
a pair of truck who immediately attack her and then meet a wacky demise,negative
there is also some rampant product placement in the film most notably for popeyes tylenol and aw root beer with the latter actually putting its logo on the tshirt of one of the rapists,negative
finally just one word monsters,negative
faye dunaway and peter otoole ham it up unmercifully however when otoole overacts hes entertaining and when dunaway does it shes annoying her character actually says the line seize them,negative
at one point,negative
dunaways henchmen played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beattys otis character from the first two superman movies,negative
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent naive character shes written to be as shes able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable,negative
believability aside though its still annoying,negative
now despite all this negativity and im not alone here supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested but excited about its release on dvd,negative
they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd to the delight of many people including myself,negative
yet im still unclear as to why since this movie is so awful,negative
the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u s theaters,negative
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 35 1 is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and has been remastered in full thx glory,negative
extras on the disc include a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent 50minute documentary from 1984 called supergirlthe making of a feature dig that workout montage 5 trailers 3 tv spots talent bios indepth storyboards accompanied by score from the movie and assorted still galleries,negative
the transfer on this international version is incredible,negative
youd think you were watching a new release,negative
images are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts,negative
only some special effects sequences show the wear of time and there just isnt much that can be done about that unless youre obsessive like george lucas,negative
the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places however youll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films golanglobus production,negative
the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries,negative
bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that theres no dead air on the track,negative
bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation,negative
although at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he doesnt get that response,negative
we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track most notably the almost appearance in the film by christopher reeve,negative
great detail is given about supermans proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out,negative
as it stands superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission,negative
for the sake of brevity i wont even get into that one,negative
szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed to stand on its own replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense,negative
bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office,negative
again for the sake of brevity i wont even get into that one,negative
anchor bay has also released a limited edition only 50 000 copies pressed twodisc set,negative
disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release,negative
disc two features the never before seen directors cut of the film which runs 138 minutes long,negative
the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which dont add much of note except for a few moments which lengthen peter otooles screen time particularly during his latter appearances,negative
the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono but fans of the film wont care,negative
one question though,negative
shouldnt the directors commentary be on the directors cut of the film,negative
id never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd,negative
i was nine when it was released to theaters and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it,negative
so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect,negative
i knew the film wasnt beloved and i never had any interest in it before but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc,negative
as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong,negative
come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo,negative
so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started,negative
at the end of the film supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron and flies back to argo city,negative
ugh i give up,negative
im surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once not twice but three times to review these discs,negative
supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package but a very lousy movie,negative
pg,negative
capsule a wild jungle woman and an 11story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc,negative
this is a laughable 1977 rip off of king kong 1976 itself a ripoff,negative
production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter,negative
high 2 4 to 4,negative
directed by ho menghua,negative
this film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the festival,negative
an earthquake uncovers an 11story tall gorilla in the himalayas,negative
a hunter chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape,negative
evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of,negative
gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible,negative
nice miniature effects however,negative
has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chichi the leopard,negative
several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim,negative
actual location shooting in mysore,negative
ape shown badly matted behind temple,negative
combining of images usually pretty bad,negative
incompetent matching of film stocks,negative
stock footage frequently used,negative
gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good,negative
i love movies,negative
i really do,negative
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas 1990 or raiders of the lost ark 1981 a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent skill and entertainment that is on display,negative
even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 13 1994 or ghostbusters ii 1988 while not exactly brilliantly well made are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value,negative
then theres my favourite martian the exact opposite of what a movie should be a hurried poorly written and acted movie with one goal to make money,negative
disney ever since the lion king 1994 have lost their magic touch but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk,negative
christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t v reporters tim ohara car daniels and soon tim finds the martian in his home trying to recover and fix his spaceship,negative
along with his zoot spacesuit voiced by wayne knight must fix his spaceship before it explodes and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public firstly by ohara but later by rival t v presenter brace channing hurley by calling himself tims uncle martin,negative
laughter is supposed to arise from the comical events but never does,negative
many bad films have good intentions but my favourite martian doesnt appear to try to provide any entertainment,negative
filled to the brim with wham bang special effects my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy,negative
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie ive never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now,negative
jeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless,negative
his performance is incredibly lazy although his paperthin character doesnt deserve more than the performance he gives,negative
darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever but her role is somewhat erm limited,negative
hurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like a twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating godawful performance in a moving picture,negative
way to go liz,negative
for the supporting cast disney manage to assemble every character actor out there during the film i was going he was the guy in ah er,negative
before finally giving up and switching off,negative
another major setback is the staple comedy sidekick,negative
unfortunately the writers sherri stoner and deanna oliver if anyone cares forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be funny,negative
instead they deliver zoot the martians deeply unfunny sidekick,negative
although meant to be a manic character no doubt every line that comes out of his neck is a dud,negative
a real dud,negative
citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester,negative
even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character not one child even bothered to smirk,negative
its a nice special effect though,negative
another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves,negative
or rather the lack of them,negative
my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour it goes past the bowl down the pipe and into the sewer,negative
now toilet humour can be funny as dumb and dumber 1994 humorously showed,negative
but here characters farting belching and almost getting crapped on literally is not amusing,negative
its insulting,negative
theres one good gag right before the credits but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued,negative
either that or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldnt mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes,negative
yes men at work,negative
yowza,negative
the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more,negative
there are thousands of brilliant films out there that cant get distribution yet trash like this gets released nationwide with ease,negative
thankfully as soon as it makes its money it will never be seen again and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie down the toilet,negative
did i do something bad,negative
i must have because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment,negative
heres the plot,negative
ricky jeff goldblum is producer of the goodbuy network one of those 24hour home shopping channels,negative
the new boss robert loggia plans to can rickys behind if he doesnt turn the previous months flat sales numbers around and to add to his problems ricky also has to work with kate kelly preston the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him,negative
kate and ricky dont get along and dont have any great ideas until they meet g eddie murphy a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything,negative
his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good and its this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the networks success,negative
the first problem is a flaw in the plot,negative
sure g makes people feel good,negative
sure were told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item no matter how wealthy they might be and ill even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what theyve bought,negative
but hey thats after theyve bought it,negative
why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera,negative
far from trying to sell the product g instead blathers on about how you dont even need the thing,negative
someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place,negative
you might say that people feel good about what theyve bought so they come back and by more but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable im not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind,negative
the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible,negative
another problem is in the humor,negative
you know if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy,negative
whoa partner are you in for a surprise,negative
holy man is not funny,negative
murphy the one asset youd think this movie has remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense,negative
then again maybe you dont is seriously reigned in,negative
the script gives him almost nothing to work with and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldnt be left as window dressing,negative
theres only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose and it lasts for three shouted words which seem totally out of place as a result,negative
pathetic,negative
in all there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture and theyre not even that great,negative
as a side note there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine and james brown introducing a medicalert device that shouts help me,negative
just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of a button but these never cause your personal laughometer to rise above the level of mild bemusement,negative
well you ask surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor,negative
think again buckwheat,negative
jeff goldblum disappoints,negative
kelly preston is flat but not like that,negative
robert loggia in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast cant do anything with it,negative
the script is part of the problem but these actors dont even look like they believe in the move theyre making,negative
they look a lot like theyre bored,negative
just like the audience,negative
so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy and the acting is like the siberian steppes,negative
a film that drags more than a dropped anchor,negative
but wait,negative
as if these problems dont make the film slow enough the screenplays pacing makes the movie even slower,negative
it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movies premise then more time as the film wades through a tortuous and seemingly mandatory romance between ricky and kate and a subplot involving a conniving pr man eric mccormack who wants to discredit g and take over rickys job as producer,negative
when the pr guys plan is foiled the film is climaxes were treated to that little epilogue and then we can all go home right,negative
wrong,negative
the movie goes on for another half hour,negative
continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man,negative
the only thing holy about holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming holy that movie was awful,negative
this one is for the truly pious,negative
i had an epiphany today,negative
it occurred to me while i was watching house on haunted hill,negative
it is as follows if a trailer makes the film its advertising look like a trashy stupid movie well guess what,negative
chances are there is truth in advertising,negative
too bad i didnt trust my own instincts when somethingortheother possessed me to see this movie,negative
i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of sleepy hollow,negative
that and dogma started too late in the afternoon for my schedule,negative
an hour of angel or buffy is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face,negative
i wish id seen it when it was halloween,negative
at least i would have been forgiving,negative
hey tis the season,negative
the movie was scary albeit very confusing dizzying and nauseating at first but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasnt going anywhere,negative
now i truly appreciate films like scream halloween or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic,negative
thats what spooks people out the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know,negative
there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with,negative
sure utterly unpredictable is good too but thats different from utterly nonsensical,negative
hohh house on haunted hill on the other hand,negative
well lets just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they ohsocleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago,negative
riiiiight,negative
yknow that just sends chills down my spine,negative
yeah,negative
just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil,negative
ooooooo,negative
hint blood and guts only work a few times,negative
sooner or later people start to tell themselves that its just ketchup and props and youve got to come up with something better than that,negative
there were just too many things in this movie that weve all seen before from the inevitable plot developments of strangers unwittingly trapped together strangers turning against each other the evil manifesting itself the dead coming back for a last scare,negative
each was more predictable than the last,negative
why didnt these fools just stay together in one place anyways,negative
sheesh,negative
was i grossed out,negative
yes,negative
did i get spooked a few times,negative
yes,negative
but why,negative
i get really disturbed when there is no why,negative
when there werent random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect which wasnt that good either trust me and the scare the film was filled with drab laughable dialogue,negative
the characters were incredibly flat and cliched,negative
not to mention downright annoying,negative
youve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives of course theyre dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night,negative
jeez i thought no one fell for those you may already be a winner things anymore,negative
and of course all three gals are babes,negative
i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of shine ended up in this movie,negative
keep that up geoff and youll qualify for the next batman venture,negative
the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because well he just cracks me up,negative
and famke jansen sp,negative
because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan,negative
pierce brosnan hey i willingly endured dantes peak three times for him,negative
all right i concede,negative
there were a couple of things i enjoyed,negative
that perverted little amusement park at the beginning,negative
i probably wont ride a rollercoaster for a while,negative
and the machine they used to drive geoffreys character mad see i dont even remember their names,negative
the machine not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it,negative
i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie,negative
it wouldnt have redeemed the film but at least it would have made me feel better,negative
but no they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending,negative
thank god they didnt add a kiss at the end or i would have puked,negative
god there is no hope,negative
it seems like im reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now,negative
scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground againthe serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the relentless department,negative
i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend its citizen hook,negative
jennifer lovehewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie jameswho apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by waking,negative
up,negative
she lives in fear of ben willis the vengeful fishermanvictim of a hit and run by julie and her pals,negative
paranoid and beat she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla norwood winner of the local radio stations 4th of july getaway giveaway,negative
bikiniready julie invites boyfriend ray prinze jr whoand heres the movies biggest mysteryturns her down but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before takeoff,negative
until he gets a roadside visit from captain hellliner himself that is,negative
unaware of this and feeling shunned julie goes on vacation anyway with karla karlas boyfriend pfeiffer and will matthew settle a real boynextdoor type whos sweet on julie,negative
to make a long story shorti cant believe it took a paragraph to describe the setup for this gratuitous sequelthe trip is a disaster,negative
not only is it storm season not only is the desk clerk the frighteners jeffrey combs a jerk not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis onebyone but the karaoke machine isnt working properly,negative
you think killing is hard,negative
try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynors i will survive now contains the lyric i still know what you did last summer,negative
all is not lostray is on his way to save the day and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co,negative
this picture is really about breasts two of them,negative
julie like a good horror heroine never does up her shirt to the collar always wears white in the rain and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan,negative
based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie i cant imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to mehe gets jennifer lovehewitt and my generation got heather langenkamp,negative
lucky bastard,negative
i didnt like i know what you did last summer and i cant say i liked this continuation any more or less,negative
the pacing in both films is languidhow is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development,negative
i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one though and at least it explains away williss random selection of victims,negative
i dont think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer,negative
director cannon judge dredd is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative oneif there is a part three what on earth would they call it and the fun denouement suggests there will be heres my suggestion hire a filmmaker with flair someone who can really energize this stillborn seriessomeone who wont rely on so many shock notes,negative
and let that person run wild with the camera,negative
aside if blandy sic must appear in the next one try to keep the number of times she says baby to a minimum,negative
thanks in advance,negative
they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movies poster no sequel,negative
scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor and it is not because the wayans brothers shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera dont try,negative
what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof,negative
the first movie an outrageous lowbrow savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer succeeded because of its takenoprisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue familiar and popular,negative
in scary movie 2 the filmmakers take on the haunted houseghost story format which if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series,negative
scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn,negative
of course split pea soup is the punch line an overabundant amount which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive,negative
but this precredit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project,negative
some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original but they lack that takenoprisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque,negative
scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball and the films what lies beneath and hannibal features that only faired adequately at the box office john woos mission impossible 2 and charlies angels,negative
it is as if the wayans and their team of writers at least seven are credited just threw ideas in a blender and hoped theyd coalesce,negative
they dont,negative
while the pace of the original left you breathless the sequel moves with the speed of an 18wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road,negative
you can almost hear the reels panting,negative
scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original but it falls very short,negative
its a dissatisfying spectacle a very weak sister of a very good movie,negative
the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is,negative
come on silent bob,negative
were going to hollywood,negative
starring jason mewes kevin smith will ferrell shannon elizabeth seann william scott chris rock jason lee ben affleck,negative
directed by kevin smith,negative
rated r,negative
jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior,negative
kevin smith coming off the wonderful challenging dogma fills it with subroad trip grossout jokes and expects us to buy it because hes just ohsoironic,negative
but when a movie is so selfaware it becomes about nothing but itself we can hardly be expected to pay for admission,negative
jay and silent bob two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot have appeared in almost all of smiths movies but if im not mistaken have not starred in one until now,negative
they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood,negative
this presents two problems a they havent received a penny in royalties and b nerds on the internet whats the internet,negative
are talking trash about them,negative
what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made,negative
on the way theyre hitchhiking because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus,negative
they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animalrights group but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlies angelsstyle outfits,negative
of course they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film,negative
will ferrell who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey,negative
the movie will probably please only smiths diehard undiscerning fans everyone else will be critical of this mindbogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past,negative
any appeal the movie has will come from the in jokes most of which i think i understood but the movie is in to the point of absurdity,negative
there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness,negative
once jay and silent bob get to hollywood the movie abruptly switches gears from grossout comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire,negative
countless hot movie stars and personalities make an appearance from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such lowbrow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer,negative
get it,negative
theyre so desperate for another movie they ran out of ideas and used a monkey,negative
a monkey,negative
as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of most of the really good lines are throwaways while the big painstaking gags mostly fall flat,negative
one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by when asked to comment on the clitoris dont ask jay responds the female clitoris,negative
kevin smith is a talented writer though i agree that his films would be better off if hed let a real director take the helm and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film,negative
unfortunately its also shapeless pointless and largely unfunny,negative
smiths verbal trampoline as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker,negative
this was supposed to be the movie that didnt offend anyone but its offensive because its terrible,negative
by phil curtolo madonna antonio banderas jonathan price in an alan parker film with music from andrew lloyd weber and lyrics by tim rice evita,negative
now i have to admit the trailer for this rockoperaturnedmajor motion picture is almost breathtaking for some,negative
the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to,negative
so why wouldnt the movie be wonderful to see,negative
simple a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane,negative
the story of eva duarte madonna evita is full of drama thats trapped inside by all the notes and chords,negative
she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker then goes into the field of acting and finally meets juan peron price the soontobe first president of argentina,negative
they fall in love and eventually marry,negative
sounds pretty good doesnt it,negative
well the story gets better as eva goes on the rainbow tour across europe trying to win respect,negative
eva duarte was a wonderful lady,negative
however all of the dramapacked moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood,negative
i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy because i was right,negative
they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar,negative
although it did come off as dull the beautiful cinematography is eyecatching as was madonnas performance,negative
as the spiritual leader of argentina madonna would have definitely been an oscarcontender had she spoken a single line,negative
but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film,negative
dont get me wrong and dont look at my grade,negative
i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen,negative
if youre going to pay to see a movie you want to see a movie,negative
now i have to admit its a lot cheaper to pay 5 than 200 plus to see the play but thats what did me in,negative
all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie,negative
now you may be saying what kind of critic is he,negative
and youre right,negative
as a critic i should have given the movie a chance,negative
but as a 17year old quentin tarantino fan it was way too hard,negative
in the continuation of warner brothers franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow,negative
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film,negative
avika goldsmans screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another,negative
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as the client is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke,negative
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another,negative
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstones batgirl who just happens to be alfreds niece,negative
the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought,negative
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment,negative
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live,negative
now the logic of that little subplot escapes me,negative
if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth,negative
this is indeed a cold hearted man,negative
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory,negative
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal,negative
she joins with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them,negative
the characters have no logic,negative
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films,negative
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any,negative
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him,negative
to say that his performance is workmanlike is to be generous,negative
his best performances are still on e r,negative
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruces latent homosexuality,negative
there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidmans psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred,negative
and even that relationship is very reserved,negative
robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series,negative
now hes just a spoiled kid,negative
in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batmans partner and friend,negative
now robin is suffering from ego deficiency,negative
robins attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of 15,negative
his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense,negative
chris odonnell once considered a rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance,negative
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking,negative
the less said about alicia silverstones performance the better,negative
this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film,negative
she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it,negative
this brings us to the villains,negative
arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday,negative
the most rediculous scene is during mr freezes imprisonment,negative
the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film,negative
its almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member,negative
umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status,negative
her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette 1978,negative
the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough,negative
these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film,negative
without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel,negative
mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video,negative
every villain even the minor ones have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume,negative
with this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to its tv incarnation,negative
the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows,negative
gwaaaas and clangs associated with the old series,negative
you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film,negative
the special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film,negative
and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing,negative
every set from ivys lair the batcave to freezes hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come,negative
there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film,negative
everything is set for maximum exposure,negative
the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have,negative
there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured,negative
joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair,negative
camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series,negative
master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had,negative
mr schumacher is a good director,negative
one just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that,negative
but batman and robin comes off as a mated made for tv movie,negative
the film has no style of individuality,negative
it is the cinematic equivalent to jello pretty to look at but empty,negative
it is unfortunate that this film even with its surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warners thought tim burton would do with the franchise,negative
kill it,negative
joel schumachers batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately,negative
boring,negative
stars,negative
even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material as this subpar submarine comedy proves,negative
down periscope stars kelsey frasier grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officers james coburn plan to get him out of the navy,negative
like any lame emsemble comedy the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out the fat guy who eats all the time the beautiful woman who doesnt belong there lauren holly the secondincommand who does everything by the book rob schneider the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out harry dean stanton and so on,negative
then comes the transparent plotline,negative
first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard,negative
after the ship is fixed up come the early drills where everyone seems completely inept like the electrician who cant connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone,negative
finally and this covers the final hour of the movie grammer has to lead his men and holly to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise,negative
and he has to be a clever rebel to do it in scenes that stretch all levels of believability,negative
first theyre singing louie louie like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off then thirty minutes later theyre making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off,negative
the whole while evil captain coburn is overacting underwater cursing grammer as most people watching the movie probably are too,negative
its all predictable without any original humor to redeem it,negative
the jokes are right out of mchales navy and other cutrate sitcoms of the past,negative
theres one scene where schneider looks through the ships pantry in disgust holds one food can up and announces this expired in 1966,negative
i yelled back at the screen so did these jokes,negative
i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it,negative
my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and around the start of the second hour i started writing my will,negative
the blame cant really be placed on the stars though,negative
kelsey grammer is good in this he just doesnt have anything to work with,negative
his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had welcome aboard tatooed on his penis,negative
grammer probably did something even worse got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about,negative
same for holley save the penis part who is likeable in down periscope just because shes so gorgeous,negative
as for schneider whose character is downright annoying there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas although hes still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the snl ship,negative
my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy okay its police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster,negative
judging from the video box most other movie critics agree with me,negative
the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channels jim ferguson,negative
i guess even jeff craig from 60 second preview who said tank girl kicks butt,negative
without ever seeing it didnt like this,negative
i seem to have glued myself,negative
to myself,negative
starring jason biggs seann william scott chris klein thomas ian nichols allyson hannigan shannon elizabeth natasha lyonne tara reid mena suvari eugene levy jennifer coolidge,negative
directed by j b rogers,negative
rated r,negative
american pie 2 reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives,negative
jim jason biggs is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance oz chris klein is still the sweetest guy on the block having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studyingabroad girlfriend stifler seann william scott is still a horny stoner kevin thomas ian nichols still has no personality and finch eddie kaye thomas still longs for stiflers mom,negative
have i missed anyone,negative
so obviously not much has changed,negative
this is not a problem provided that the movie boasts the rapidfire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original,negative
but american pie 2 is the very definition of sequelitis,negative
its coarser yes and it pushes the envelope even more but its heart isnt in it,negative
its easy cash to capitalize off the first films success but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original,negative
part of the reason why the film doesnt work i think is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was a comingofage stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness,negative
here everything has been cheapened,negative
they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking they have no motivation except for sex sex beer and sex,negative
thats not to say that you cant make a decent comedy from that premise but it is one of american pie 2s undoings,negative
missing too is the sweetness that permeated american pie the thiscouldbeyou quality of the main players,negative
here the characters are too aware of themselves as popculture icons and theyre even more onenote,negative
stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim oz and kevin are forced to make awkward selfdiscoveries at arbitrary moments none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see,negative
and then theres the soontobenotorious scene where jim superglues himself to himself which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the films ailments one that also permeated say it isnt so director j b rodgers debut,negative
theres a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation and american pie 2 is on the wrong side of it,negative
its hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them,negative
i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie,negative
if theres one redeeming factor to american pie 2 its the inimitable eugene levy as jims dad who pops in on jim as hes about to score and utters lines like your mother and i have been known to get frisky,negative
not so much anymore but,negative
and then when the girls parents walk in blurts out this must be your daughter,negative
i didnt get her name but hopefully my son did,negative
if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levys performance,negative
this is an unworthy sequel to a grossfest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy,negative
the boxoffice of this onw should keep the genre going strong which is disappointing,negative
the genre needs a hiatus filmmakers are getting lazy,negative
capsule liebes meets tod,negative
this was a film about sex and death,negative
a morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies,negative
this film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and death but imparts no insights,negative
to make matter worse this print was poorly subtitled into english from french,negative
0 4 to 4,negative
an attractive 18yearold dies on a disco floor and gets sent to a morgue,negative
one of the attendants ben jeanmarc barr is so attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia,negative
we see him crawling away after a shock,negative
in the middle of sex the dead teen has come back to life,negative
the morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his collection of kinks,negative
he was already part of a group that gets together for sex,negative
the revived teen teresa elodie bouchez joins them,negative
moral dilemma of teresas father,negative
ben has abused his daughters body but in doing so has saved her life,negative
part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins in the sexual hijinx,negative
also involved is a man in the final stages of dying of aids a close friend of the morgue attendant,negative
he does not get involved in the orgies,negative
the subtitles of our print were white often on a white background making them often hard to read but i dont think there was a whole lot of meaning there that was lost,negative
the title means dont let me die on a sunday,negative
among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early 1990s woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty star of the bgrade action films of the previous decade,negative
those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star,negative
as director ginty did very little to improve that impression,negative
the protagonist of the movie is jack played by jeff fahey yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford played by bo derek,negative
however she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer,negative
one stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder,negative
however his good friend walter j hill robert mitchum happens to be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end,negative
belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots,negative
unfortunately this film isnt comedy and any laugh is unintentional,negative
the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them,negative
the actors that play them dont help either,negative
that is especially the case with jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison,negative
his partner bo derek on the other hand shows that she didnt age enough to cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents,negative
ginty on the other hand tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer,negative
according to the publicity material with this movie the directors hope to restore good oldfashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness,negative
hmm,negative
you never know they just might be on to something,negative
what with the rise of geek chic lounge music and seventies fashion the evercontrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own,negative
but then i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it,negative
its cheesy all right but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch,negative
thats a shame because in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more,negative
woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise roy munson,negative
the movie opens in the fifties with roys dad dishing out the readers wisdom in scoopfuls shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever,negative
the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken,negative
its thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good he gives the wry derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy,negative
mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roys hand,negative
then its fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand,negative
hes hopeless until he meets ishmael randy quaid an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege,negative
so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno picking up pretty hustler claudia vanessa angel on the way,negative
with the exit of bill murray the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go and thats,negative
dumb and dumber,negative
yes indeed kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour peter and bobby farrelly the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle,negative
so prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands distended nipples ridiculous hair and bull semen,negative
get set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking striptease and unchristian neighboursocking,negative
now dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with cheap humour and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy,negative
the trouble is that these jokes arent bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction,negative
it lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack never quite getting it all together,negative
some gags fall flat from a lack of buildup while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply dont do anything,negative
why the long unfunny fight in the car park,negative
why two of these,negative
why does that guy wear mascara or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it,negative
the film is full of these halfthoughtthrough ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying wouldnt that be funny,negative
well no actually,negative
the actors dont do the movie much favours either,negative
woody harrelson comes off okay plausibly acting dumb smart cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham and vanessa angel has no talent like schwarzenegger she seems more convincing playing a computercreation than a human take the tv series weird science please,negative
even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movies climax,negative
all in all a fairly useless attempt at comedy and a certified nohoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance,negative
well have to look to a reinspired john waters or perhaps somebody from down under strictly bowling anyone for the definitive bowling comedy,negative
the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
running time approximately 1hr 40mins,negative
reviewed by jack choo,negative
rating,negative
the movie starts with a rather se7enish opening sequence rather cool and sets the mood for things to come,negative
the story propels the audience into a neoreality somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red,negative
existenz is actually the name of a new virtualreality game,negative
supposedly vr games are highly popular as is considered a legaldrug in this neoreality,negative
leigh is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate gameexperience in the form of existenz,negative
players are required to have bioports embedded in their spine which plugs to a gamepod in order to enjoy the immersive experience,negative
during a secretive betatestingcumteaser meeting for this new game an assassination attempt on life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard law,negative
is more of a realists than anything else afraid that hell lose reality if he begin to play these games but requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt,negative
as they soon discover they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected,negative
existenz has all the cronenberggore that is expected of him,negative
even so this film is nowhere near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners,negative
not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly,negative
existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90s version of videodrome even so it is a poor followup,negative
while in most of his famed films his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot,negative
in existenz the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of overindulgence than anything else,negative
jennifer jason leigh and jude law both commendable actors looked aloof and missdirected throughout the entire film,negative
the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the bgrade category,negative
it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tightbudget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film the opening sequence though probably formed a considerable portion of the budget,negative
which is actually quite good,negative
existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times,negative
10 years ago it would have been another classic for cronenberg,negative
cronenberg fans however those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you,negative
after the huge success of the exorcist in 1973 a sequel was inevitable and sadly like most horror fims that make money the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel that makes absolutely no sense at all and to me was extremely pointless wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely,negative
needless dumb sequel flopped in the box office and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time to which i agree with,negative
to start the story it is four years later and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be now a priest played by richard burton is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again maybe she was good or something,negative
now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regans body before it is too late,negative
some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is linda blair she had no need to revive her character and she is really terrible in this film she brings it down to a lull and in places it seems like it just stops in its place and doesnt go anywhere,negative
louise fletcher is alright for what its worth but she could have done a lot better than this,negative
the direction by john boorman is that of a confused stylish nature that i really couldnt figure out,negative
in fact i had no idea what was going on in this film the script was jumbled the plot was jumbled and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad,negative
for those exorcist fans who havent seen this one i recommend renting it,negative
i actually gave this one a high rating if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction but nothing else,negative
im not saying i like the film now so dont start going anywhere,negative
bad bad bad movie,negative
i would appreciate it if you didnt do that again,negative
starring jet li bridget fonda tch ky karyo burt kwouk,negative
directed by chris nahon,negative
rated r,negative
its no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another,negative
when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission there is no problem with this as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners,negative
when they arent well were in bad shape,negative
kiss of the dragon jet lis second consecutive american misfire plays like one big miscalculation and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment,negative
now before i start getting emails angrily touting the genius of jet li let me explain myself,negative
li is as spectacular as ever here and i dont think anyone would ever dare call his martialartsstar skills into question,negative
the problem isnt with him its with the movies tone,negative
the much touted fightscenes here are filmed with such unflinching unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch,negative
theyre joyless perfuctory lis rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton,negative
but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side,negative
the plot isnt relevant but if youre curious its some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer li sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police tcheky karyo who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever,negative
oh yeah and lis character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain kill at the touch of a needle,negative
kiss of the dragon is the name of an acupuncture maneuver in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victims neck somehow redirecting all of the bodys bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately,negative
theres a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute whose daughter is being held hostage for some reason by the villain,negative
this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen even worse than the one in pearl harbor,negative
theres no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it its only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boymeetsgirl subplot,negative
kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson whose screenplay the messenger the story of joan of arc for all of that films flaws was at least thoughtful,negative
i dont know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic,negative
i suppose you could call this mainstream but ill choose the bizarre any time of the day,negative
if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling you need a story to justify watching them,negative
the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy,negative
no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks,negative
at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer but that was before i saw the film,negative
now my view has completely changed,negative
its time to embrace for impact because this is a very bumpy ride,negative
the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including jason nesmith tim allen alexander dane alan rickman gwen demarco sigourney weaver signing autographs at a convention,negative
they meet fans who dress up in costumes fans who worship the ground they walk on and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris robin sachs,negative
of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties and meet the ugly aliens themselves,negative
thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians,negative
the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode in fact its worse,negative
i dont even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof because quite frankly its just not funny,negative
all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series,negative
one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space because no extra on the tv show ever lives as proven in the star trek series,negative
creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea but not when they are used to death,negative
a person can only take so much,negative
we do not need to be tortured especially when you have to pay for it,negative
its pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful,negative
its not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him but a few laughs would have been helpful,negative
speaking of acting 2 fine talents were wasted as well,negative
sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage well at least it worked,negative
its pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage,negative
it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is,negative
alan rickman however was not so lucky,negative
after his last hit dogma he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess,negative
its just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away,negative
when the film couldnt get any worse thankfully some nice special effects pop up,negative
like many big blockbusters armageddon the haunting to name a few they rely heavily on effects to help boost the films box office results,negative
times it works but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk,negative
when will it stop,negative
i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash,negative
it may look fine and dandy but we need to at least have a story,negative
is that too much to ask,negative
obviously it is,negative
when galaxy quest finally ends it literally crash lands,negative
aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic its an embarrassment to the cast and its embarrassing to the science fiction genre,negative
its not the least bit fun nor was it entertaining,negative
the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond,negative
tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers all searching for deeper meaning,negative
however they wont find much meaning in the real blonde and not enough real humor either,negative
joe matthew modine is a struggling actor or he claims to be one even though he has no credits under his belt,negative
his girlfriend mary catherine keener has no pretensions about her career shes a makeup artist working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair marlo thomas and supermodel of the month sahara bridgette wilson,negative
sahara who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid has an onagain offagain relationship with joes best friend bob maxwell caulfield,negative
however bob has gotten his biggest break yet a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly daryl hannah who may be that illusive woman hes always pursued a real blonde,negative
there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde but not enough,negative
the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background such as saharas perfume ads depression its not just a state of mind,negative
but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel,negative
and unfortunately the films forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic,negative
take for example the films framing device of an old lady and her dog,negative
the story serves absolutely no purpose makes little sense and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie,negative
matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film but theyre stuck in the most boring plotlines,negative
modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley who appears as another struggling actor,negative
keeners character has a stronger edge but the insult selfdefense class taught by denis leary no less she is stuck in makes little sense,negative
the movies running time is under two hours but it seems like it is well over it,negative
theres just not enough humor to speed things along and not enough meaning to propel any drama,negative
if theres one thing i just cant stand its a film that oozes with sentimentality,negative
heres a note to all film makers films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves,negative
swelling saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless,negative
alas my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up,negative
what reminded me was that i wasnt choked up or even the slightest bit moved for that matter,negative
my giant is a forced contrived and conspicuously uncute i detest the word cute but ive chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a cute film here,negative
it takes a premise that might have been interesting i liked the preview and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience,negative
maybe it will work for some people,negative
it didnt work for me,negative
billy crystal plays sam cayman an agent who at the beginning of the film is in romania,negative
hes in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film,negative
the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired get in a car accident and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall,negative
his name is max gheorghe muresan and sam thinks hed be a great movie star because of his size,negative
subplots are as follows sam has a son and a wife kathleen quinlan and hes never around for them so they move to chicago,negative
max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins,negative
sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money and so their various subplots can all be resolved,negative
sam is broke,negative
max is dying,negative
pass the kleenex,negative
my giant as a comedy is only moderately funny,negative
it has its moments the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself,negative
in one great scene sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal of course his son doesnt believe that hes actually speaking to seagal and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect,negative
crystal is always entertaining and he has a few good lines here some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely often however hes countered by a slew of jokes that arent funny and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes,negative
muresan is kind of fun to watch but he just cant act very well,negative
quinlan on the other hand is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents,negative
she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff,negative
here the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent,negative
all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that for much of its running time is simply mediocre,negative
as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings,negative
sams multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family,negative
later it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sams reunion with his family,negative
and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing but i had a few morality problems with it and i apologize for being vague,negative
its icky,negative
it drips with gooey wannabe human emotions,negative
my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film,negative
more importantly it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is,negative
instead its a complicated overlong and underengaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears,negative
and since it left me feeling completely unmoved i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world,negative
capsule silly and inane adaptation of gibsons short story which is nowhere in sight,negative
gibsons script only adds insult to injury,negative
johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie,negative
i say awesomely because its one thing to fail but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged,negative
keanur reeves who is terrible stars as johnny an information courier who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head,negative
he is given one last job whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words run which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal,negative
one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories but its only followed up on in a token fashion,negative
for his trouble johnny gets chased by the yakuza who seem to be the new bad guys in all the hightech thrillers,negative
whats funny is that if you watch gangster movies made in japan there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics but of course theres no room in this movie for any of that,negative
the yakuza are simply used to point guns wave swords flaunt tattoos and grimace menacingly,negative
i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies bound by honor sugar hill and american me come to mind when asians remain perpetually stereotyped,negative
but thats another essay,negative
anyway johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark,negative
why newark,negative
maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york thats why,negative
there he meets an assortment of odd characters icet dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos,negative
the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture,negative
it turns out what else that the data in johnnys head could save a lot of people but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesnt kill him,negative
handled right this could have been absorbing but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity,negative
the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other better movies blade runner and brazil come to mind,negative
everything looks rundown and scummy everyone dresses like theyre punk rockers and videophones are commonplace,negative
snore,negative
the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively untechnical fellow would think it would look and behave like,negative
a hacker of johnnys caliber would be blasting away with one commandline function after another instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms but of course thats not cinematic,negative
whatever,negative
what went wrong with this movie,negative
gibson wrote his own screenplay which i guess is part of the problem what works as a short story doesnt work in a movie,negative
his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesnt advance it convulses,negative
from the script on out it was probably all downhill,negative
renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless theres no fun in kicking a wounded dog is there,negative
synopsis a small town thug convinces a dimwitted highschool student to spy on his girlfriend who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night,negative
while this is going on the thug the father the boyfriend and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter,negative
comments to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement,negative
im not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter,negative
suspense,negative
family drama,negative
humor,negative
erotica,negative
elements of each of these genres exist in the film yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them,negative
instead the babysitter is a dull lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers,negative
i suppose this film could have been watchable if it werent for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing,negative
alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer the babysitter,negative
her character has absolutely no depth at all and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters fantasies,negative
everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends,negative
the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds,negative
the father played by j t,negative
walsh fantasizes about the babysitter the mother fantasizes about her husbands best friend,negative
none of these fantasy sequences trust me are things that need to be seen but we see them anyway complete with cheesy makeout saxophone music,negative
the thug in the meantime proves that hes evil through his annoying habit of smashing halfempty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason,negative
the most absurd character however is the babysitters boyfriend who seems catatonically braindead,negative
the thug in a manipulative iagolike manner though he doesnt really need to try hard manages to talk the boyfriend into bingedrinking smoking grass running away from cops and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes,negative
incredible,negative
of course the boyfriends original plan for the evening was try not to laugh to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j d salinger,negative
if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful then it fails,negative
there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film and nearly all of them come at the final minute,negative
by that time however the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them,negative
no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception,negative
if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous then it also fails,negative
i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed at times to be played for laughs,negative
if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic then once again it fails,negative
the characters are onedimensional and uninteresting,negative
finally if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning then it fails as well,negative
the dream sequences arent erotic they are too brief and outside of one very short scene contain no nudity,negative
i cant completely trash this movie,negative
the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight,negative
the other 79 minutes though are a drag,negative
silverstones character at the end of the movie turns to her boyfriend and asks what were you thinking,negative
i asked myself the same question having spent 99 cents renting this turkey,negative
you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing and,negative
its not a comedy,negative
and what a strange career path for director chuck russell,negative
he starts his career off with a decent take on the nightmare on elm street series with his debut as director on installment number three,negative
he follows that up with the blob the very next year but waits another six years to do his next piece a little film called the mask starring jim carrey and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that,negative
so then he thought let me wait another five years get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes,negative
strange dude and one crappy flick,negative
plot a sixyear old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god,negative
a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side while the girls aunt wants to well,negative
save her from those damn devil worshippers,negative
enter one occult expert agent plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying and youve just about got the gist of things here,negative
critique with plot holes the size of my ass this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ridden plot with wasted talent cheezy effects bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot,negative
whats good about this movie,negative
well rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway childrens supreme with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around,negative
the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesnt really do all that much,negative
and believe it or not i was actually enjoying some of the films first half hour which starts off with some promise but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist basinger just drown the films entire basis of believability,negative
for some reason it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes is,negative
a dumb one,negative
add that to the entire police force of incompetents save for jimmy smits whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move,negative
at least change the clothes jimmy zero scares zero thrills and even less actual drama and youve got yourself a pretty bad movie,negative
and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie,negative
did they owe the director a favor or something,negative
together they barely have five minutes of screen time but i suppose that riccis hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horndogs,negative
the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of sneaking up on a mans house who they know to be guilty of a crime,negative
uuuhmm hows,negative
about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass officers,negative
anyway i dont usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof and there was plenty to go around,negative
and did basinger lose some of her acting talent during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win,negative
difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad or if she just delivered them poorly,negative
either way little originality very obvious computer effects little thrills little drama and very little entertainment value certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film,negative
but if you really dont mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and kid based thrillers and enjoy watching films that dont bring anything new to the table well,negative
drink some beers smoke some beans and rent this video because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year,negative
youd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games,negative
it hasnt worked so far,negative
street fighter,negative
super mario brothers,negative
wing commander,negative
mortal kombat,negative
not a watchable film in the bunch,negative
still i held out some hope for tomb raider,negative
after all the games premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept,negative
however despite the potential of the project tomb raider proves to be yet another bomb,negative
the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies,negative
theres a onceever5000years alignment of planets coming up and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world,negative
of course the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world,negative
our heroine lady lara croft angelina jolie finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father jon voight dug up,negative
she figures that if she gets the triangle she can bring her dad back from the dead,negative
of course no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway,negative
in both video games and action movies the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences,negative
however the action in tomb raider shows little style or originality,negative
theres lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap directtocable flick,negative
the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer the mummy returns was much better it had its flaws but its action was creative and largescale,negative
since winning her academy award for girl interrupted jolie hasnt taken any projects that would display her acting talents,negative
tomb raider seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts so much attention is drawn to them that its a shame theres no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra,negative
while we dont see much of her acting ability with the exception of a wonderful uppercrust british accent we do get a hint of jolies less savory side,negative
considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father and uninterested in any of the living males around her seems a poor choice,negative
having jolies real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier,negative
i havent decided what to make of director simon west yet,negative
his first feature was the starstudded disaster con air but my opinion of him improved with the generals daughter which was thick with sultry atmosphere,negative
now this train wreck,negative
i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series the prisoner,negative
hollywood has already screwed up the avengers and the prisoner represents a chance for redemption,negative
by the way speaking of british tv red dwarf fans should look for chris rimmer barrie in his first major film role,negative
this wellconceived but ultra sugary comingofage film is not for everyone and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion,negative
joseph cross joshua beal is a 10yearold who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather loggia to bone marrow cancer,negative
loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup,negative
the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family where everyone is just so nice and affluent and properly religious without being fanatical,negative
the beals the father denis leary and his wife dana delany are both successful doctors julia stiles plays joshuas older sister needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him,negative
this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven but living in south philadelphia sending their children to a wellrun catholic school,negative
joshua the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn is a handsome sweet intelligent friendly and endearing child who does well in school relates to the nuns and priests and talks politely to his wellmeaning parents,negative
all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch,negative
the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather who promised to be with him forever,negative
his answer is to search for god pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do but thats just the way it is sometimes,negative
this search for god takes us nowhere because as his friend david reifsnyder says where can you look for him if he doesnt exist,negative
now thats a smart kid,negative
but joseph looks for him in the usual places and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends,negative
one of his teachers is the kindhearted sister terry rosie odonnell who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball making him the cleanup hitter and in my opinion if she wasnt a big tv star would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher she is that convincing,negative
throughout the film she is saved from answering any tough sic,negative
question about god by the bell as it rings to end the class,negative
nothing much happens in the search for god there is no parody of the catholic school though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god but this is gentle stuff no real criticism or search for god is attempted,negative
what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum which is designed not to upset anyone as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real live angel a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goodygoody,negative
the film ends as this angel,negative
tells him his grandfather is all right,negative
his quest is ended as apparently angels dont have wings and are approachable and god well,negative
maybe thats for another film down the road,negative
this part of the film was the final straw for me i couldnt swallow any more goo,negative
as this film flopped commercially his next one the sixth sense pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose,negative
though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts this director is loaded with hokum all he has learned how to do is hide the hokum better,negative
well god bless him if he can do that,negative
this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood,negative
its just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death children in a parochial elementary school or for that matter about god,negative
and that family of his theyre too good for words,negative
yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place,negative
for those who want to see something soft without a bite to it this is the one,negative
vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico,negative
the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow james woods is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out,negative
while the initial imagery is a little overdramatic it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence,negative
that is enough action to last us a while and we could director john carpenter would let us get to a story line,negative
but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene,negative
then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that,negative
the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end,negative
and that is something of a pity because the film based on the book vampire by john steakley gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery,negative
this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it,negative
what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires,negative
there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore,negative
anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans,negative
this has not always been carpenters style,negative
his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the films central science fictional question,negative
jack crow heads a vampire swat team cleaning up nests of vampires with hightech spears and crossbows,negative
in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek thomas ian griffith who has been tipped off to who crow is,negative
now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya daniel baldwin,negative
to make matters worse he does not know the people on his own side tony and his backers he can trust,negative
meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico,negative
if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions thats exactly what it is,negative
the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin,negative
but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film show people dont tell them,negative
just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown,negative
fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding why are the vampires in new mexicowhat do they want and why do they want it what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it,negative
the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized but instead are revealed through dialog,negative
now if all this was not bad enough carpenter misuses the james wood persona,negative
woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well,negative
but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergioleone style mythic posturing,negative
while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target,negative
woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero,negative
that is not his style and it just does not work very well,negative
there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses,negative
in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor,negative
one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair,negative
as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down,negative
one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret,negative
these vampires do not maintain a low profile,negative
there are arguably logical flaws in the film,negative
there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires,negative
it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight,negative
i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out,negative
while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
perhaps i will read the book,negative
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives,negative
are we doing what we want to be doing,negative
what happened to our dreams,negative
with the new millennium our collective big birthday just around the corner some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence,negative
the old standbys of traditional religion and science arent doing it for many anymore and theyre looking for something else,negative
well be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years,negative
ricky hayman jeff goldblum is having a career crisis,negative
the programming director for the good buy home shopping network hes going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically,negative
new producer kate newell kelly preston is supposed to whip things into shape,negative
when the two are fixing a flat they almost run down new age pilgrim g murphy,negative
g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they dont really want all that commercial crap,negative
in some unexplained manner this causes sales to sour,negative
ricky is saved,negative
the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all,negative
its not an overthetop comedy or a heartwarming message of humanity,negative
it is a mishmosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog,negative
i am willing to put up with preaching from a film but the messages here are old hat,negative
you should take time to smell the roses,negative
selling your soul for cash is a bad idea,negative
golly,negative
im glad i saw the movie,negative
i never would have thought of these,negative
the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed,negative
when g takes a chainsaw to the set theres an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious,negative
it doesnt happen,negative
the bits are so subdued and overlylong that theres only a hint of laughter from the audience,negative
murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better,negative
there are hints of promise in this one,negative
the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shavedheaded character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen,negative
the others are horrendous,negative
goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his invasion of the body snatchers,negative
his relationship with kate makes no sense,negative
they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen,negative
preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be,negative
somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value,negative
an attempt to satirize stupid television we get a selfparody instead,negative
if youre going to make a twohour hollywood injoke why bother releasing it to the general public,negative
if youre going to create a film that will appeal primarily to bigname actors and people who know woody allen then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters,negative
while watching celebrity i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people,negative
what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited selfdeprecation,negative
celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself living in a world that hes familiar with dealing with people like the ones he actually knows,negative
allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more,negative
branagh plays lee simon a journalistturnedscreenwriter who divorces his wife robin judy davis shacks up with some hot women famke janssen charlize theron winona ryder and goes about trying to get big stars melanie griffith leonardo dicaprio to read his script about an armored car robbery,negative
the usual elements of recent allen films are all here including the sexual insecurity of the main character lots of selfloathing women and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another,negative
unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally its not likely that youll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity,negative
aside from all the injokes the story falls far short of compelling and the characters are all empty and lifeless,negative
branagh proves once again that hes a superb performer nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly,negative
the problem is that hes the same character allen always plays a character whos getting more than a little dull to watch,negative
i mean come on how many times have you seen this guy,negative
he hates his work and he cant be satisfied by any one woman and at the end of the movie nothing has been solved,negative
he brings all of his problems upon himself crashing his car because hes receiving fellatio and other such stunts so its pretty hard to care about him,negative
in addition isnt allen capable of creating characters who arent just like him,negative
i know he is but he didnt do it in celebrity,negative
the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances,negative
davis playing the same woman with low selfesteem that she played in deconstructing harry has a few touching moments but ends up the same despicable celebritytype that fills the rest of the movie,negative
some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty theron and ryder especially but theyre not likable people,negative
only famke janssen as a book editor interested in simons new novel has any life,negative
the men in the picture dont do much better joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin while dicaprio as a christian depptype spoiled young actor is funny but disengaging,negative
whats really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its themes are,negative
allen seems to think that hes making an insightful movie about the way normal people look at celebrities,negative
the main problem with this is that the character with whom were supposed to identify simon is not a normal guy hes just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters,negative
the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us none of them register as realistic interesting characters they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue,negative
in addition allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly robin in this scene says something like its interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate,negative
celebrity is arguably allens biggest misfire to date,negative
it does have a few good scenes therons superorgasmic model character is kind of funny and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two,negative
but celebrity is a failure at the core unless allens point was to make a selfindulgent movie about himself and his friends,negative
if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke then he succeeded in that,negative
i for one dont enjoy feeling like an outsider,negative
the above is dialogue from this film taken almost completely in context and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is,negative
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously,negative
mr gregg imhavingamidlifecrisis araki the writer and director of this film wants to show how important teenagers are and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible horrible world,negative
and how does he show it,negative
by really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this,negative
oh and it gets better,negative
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of oh i dunno the fiftieth sex scene in this film im not counting the several masturbation scenes,negative
in it one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another and he says to her something along the lines of do you ever wonder what life is all about,negative
sorry man foreplay takes place before the act of coitus,negative
of course what do you expect the film was written and directed by a guy who cant even spell his first name right yes i know its a cheap joke but it had to be done,negative
the doom generation is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them and also as another teen angst film one of the slogans is teen is a fourletter word hardy har har,negative
its a film about two angsty teens amy blue rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum in scream and jordon white james duval who would go on to play randy quaids son in independence day who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac xavier red jonathan schaech who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in that thing you do,negative
and by the way do you get the symbolism,negative
red white and blue,negative
huh,negative
huh and go on a road trip where three things happen in no order 1 they have sex 2 they run into weird people 3 they kill them,negative
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films,negative
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide,negative
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper,negative
the doom generation doesnt want to do this it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level,negative
he wants to show everything in a weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about,negative
heres one scene an earlier scene in the film amy and jordan go into a quicke mart type place to get food and other stuff,negative
amy is smoking and the clerk an asian man mind you i love how racist this film is i really do tells her to put it out,negative
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note,negative
he points a shotgun at her and she puts it out reluctantly,negative
jordan makes two hot dogs and takes them to the counter,negative
the cash register rings up 6 66,negative
oh and this symbolism doesnt stop here,negative
jordan checks for his wallet but its really in the car,negative
he asks amy for it but she left her wallet in the car as well,negative
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money,negative
they say they dont have it,negative
he gets ready to kill them but then xavier who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before pops out of nowhere fights with the clerk and ends with him blowing the clerks head clean off clean wound mind you,negative
the head is shown flying through the air and lands in a fryer where it begins to scream,negative
i dont really object to this kind of sick violence but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only to gross you out,negative
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme hell make some kind of art,negative
wrong,negative
it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art,negative
when george romero made dawn of the dead a very gory flick even for today he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick,negative
same goes for peter jacksons disgustingly gory dead alive which features a 30 minute long fest of blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body taking out all sorts of zombies,negative
it was sick but it was also satirical and controled,negative
a scene like this has no purpose in the film and it sticks out from everything else that happens,negative
heres a couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards a man attacks the trio and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword put there just so this could happen a fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm is shot off by xavier and various other annoyances,negative
also look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people who probably didnt really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it just like peter otoole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably didnt when they signed to be in caligula,negative
people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line,negative
why are they here,negative
so that we can all point to them and say hey look its fill in the blank,negative
wow,negative
gimme a break,negative
the films meaning is pretty easy to detect that you know teens are so precious and the world is such a horrible place that when the two entities collide theres a giant explosion of horrific violence,negative
otherwise defined as teen angst or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you,negative
look im 19 years old,negative
i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did,negative
ive since moved on to i dont really know what to do with my life phase but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks theyre dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse,negative
part of being a teen is experimenting and testing the waters,negative
its not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent,negative
this is what the characters in this film do and the film wants to show how theyre these great people who are being punished by the world because theyre teenagers and how they try to defend themselves but cant totally overcome them,negative
its not their fault they kill people its the worlds,negative
what they really need is a reality check,negative
the world is a bad place and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting,negative
but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it,negative
the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and theres nothing they can do about it,negative
hence the title,negative
not only does it have bad fallacy but it cant even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner,negative
everythings overly surreal and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex,negative
how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst,negative
how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way,negative
and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film,negative
if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction hed show them for what they really are,negative
and if he didnt want the satirical approach hed show the real problems with the world,negative
and if you still dont think that the doom generation is incompetent on every single possible level it could be take the acting,negative
rose macgowan is horrible,negative
yes she proved herself talented in scream but shes so bad in the doom generation that if i had not seen her in scream i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today,negative
her entire performance is onenote bitchy and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that its laughable,negative
equally bad is jonathan schaech who wants to be the slacker serial killer someone who doesnt have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain,negative
his performance is annoying as hell and granted he was better in that thing you do,negative
and then theres james duval,negative
lets just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando,negative
he has the same kind of slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him least talented actor in the world,negative
i have seen lots of bad actors but james duval has got to be the worst,negative
or at least somewhere up there,negative
heres another example of a bad scene if youre still not convinced the film opens up in a club where theyre playing nine inch nails most banal song heresy example of the lines god is no one there is a ll see you there and as the song plays and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing the film pans over to amy just standing there looking dispondent,negative
the film closes in on her she looks right at the camera and says fuck,negative
no explanation of this should be necessary,negative
and finally a note to gregg grow up,negative
really,negative
move out of your parents basement read something other than salinger and get a day job,negative
and dont quit it,negative
tomb raider,negative
fun,negative
exciting,negative
challenging,negative
given the unprecedented popularity especially among teenage boys of the video game that sports an uberbuff pistol packin babe who raids well,negative
tombs you have to believe its these three things and more,negative
lara croft tomb raider the big screen variant of said video game which features a pumpedup angelina jolie the oscar winner for girl interrupted no less in the title role is however none of these things,negative
it isnt fun it isnt exciting and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat i suffered through to the bitter bitter end the wife opted for barnes noble at the 45minute mark,negative
directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to con air tomb raider is an emptyheaded big budget bore,negative
the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys hudson hawk the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that when brought together well,negative
who the heck cares and it makes super mario bros bob hoskins illadvised career move look like rocco and his brothers that classic of italian neorealism,negative
ill go out on a limb here and say i suspect theres actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper,negative
this is where the jolie game nuts jump in and say this movie isnt about character development its about kicking serious butt or bum since ms croft hails from englands green and pleasant,negative
with lips breasts and biceps all inflated to the max lara croft is all about posturing and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough,negative
ok lets forget challenging,negative
shouldnt tomb raider be at the very least fun and exciting,negative
shouldnt our buttkicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of say james bond with the wit of indiana jones,negative
theres no humor to be found anywhere in tomb raider even though it tries hard from time to time,negative
even the mummy returns didnt take itself too seriously,negative
the villain here is noticeably lacking the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated and the script is nonexistent,negative
to liven things up perhaps jolies live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as laras dead father lord croft talk about a stretch,negative
one thing i hadnt expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa although i suspect that thinlooking moustache hes forced to wear gets in the way some,negative
unsuccessful not entirely,negative
if anything lara croft tomb raider makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about,negative
if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films i might say that i review movies that dont look particularly good because im doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it,negative
if that were true i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies so you dont have to,negative
but i know thats bunkyoure going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say,negative
so i have to tell the truth every once in a while i get a nasty masochistic urge to see a bad movie,negative
you know the feeling when youre sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly,negative
sometimes i think thats why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies ever,negative
admit it sometimes you like seeing bad movies,negative
so do i,negative
so i saw supernova,negative
truth be told supernova wasnt quite as bad as i thought it might be,negative
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadnt started tinkering with the directors walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed,negative
maybe im becoming a softy,negative
in any case i didnt find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe,negative
but its still bad,negative
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale,negative
the crew includes captain a j,negative
marley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz,negative
there are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction which puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female,negative
dont expect any more explanation because you wont get it,negative
anyway the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent,negative
during the dimension jump i think thats what its called but dont hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board,negative
he calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with,negative
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening,negative
have you seen alien,negative
have you seen event horizon a lame movie in its own right,negative
good,negative
then youve seen supernova,negative
postproduction cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either,negative
after all no ones going to think for a second that troy wont turn out to be a villain,negative
but the bigger problem with supernova is that it can t just stick to the simple plot its afforded,negative
numerous rewrites the script may be credited to three people but its a gross underestimate have crammed this lean 90minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped,negative
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot,negative
did the ships computer learn something about humanity,negative
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him,negative
and just what does the films title signify if anything,negative
as far as i can tell it refers to a very small plot detail that isnt developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements,negative
character relationships in this film also make very little sense,negative
for some reason every person in this film keeps having sex,negative
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes,negative
bassett and spaders characters start off hating each other,negative
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later theyre engaging in some hankypanky,negative
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love with him,negative
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut,negative
the most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film starts there are no opening credits,negative
furthermore the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits,negative
maybe thats why the films title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster,negative
right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie youre seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene with littletono introduction to any of the characters or situations,negative
the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point a to point b point a danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby,negative
point b tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing,negative
doesnt make sense,negative
since i didnt understand anything about these characters motivations did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone and he does knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes,negative
not a whit,negative
its a shame because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do,negative
they dont find it,negative
bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces,negative
sexual tension,negative
more like constipation,negative
maybe theyre just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice,negative
not that we ever find out who that is mind you,negative
the climax of their relationship taking place in a transport pod is probably the films biggest foreheadslapper,negative
as troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected,negative
he s awfully onenote but its not as if hes given any more notes to work with,negative
the rest of the cast does even less,negative
tunney stands around looking cute then scared,negative
phillips broods,negative
cruz flirts with the computer,negative
then they all die and a star blows up or something but i really wasnt paying much attention by then,negative
supernova is pretty awful but im cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got,negative
thats it,negative
if you expect it to be good for whatever reasons you may have youll probably hate it more than i will,negative
even the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven t seen before and suffice to say the script isnt going to save the film,negative
honestly though what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym,negative
it usually results in a bad movie and thats what supernova is,negative
surrounded by hype high hopes and the promise of an overthetop performance by cluelesss brittany murphy dont say a word looked full of promise,negative
hell when i hear that ill never tell whisper on the tv commercial goose bumps run up my spine,negative
alas word is filled with little but disappointment a kooky mix of girl interrupted and ransom with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller,negative
douglas stars as nathan conrad renowned new york psychologist devoted father of jessie conrad skye mccole bartusiak and loving husband to aggie conrad famke janssen,negative
after a gang of jewel thieves headed by sean beans koster kidnaps his daughter nathan is forced to extract from his new patient the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows murphy the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago,negative
but with hardnosed detective sandra cassidy jennifer esposito doing her best j lo impression tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeths head in order to get the goods inside,negative
the catch nathan only has until five oclock to solve the puzzle,negative
whoa the suspense is almost too much,negative
dont say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes,negative
murphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie then turns around and reprises like her role from girl interrupted,negative
and the only real crazy to be found in the film is director gary fleders things to do in denver when youre dead staggering use of flashback sequences,negative
oliver platt famke janssen and even sean bean are decent actors but the stuff they are given here such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch is insulting and demeaning,negative
additionally the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathans every move is downright unbelievable,negative
how do excons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment,negative
despite its flaws dont say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film youll find this month and audiences will lap it up,negative
americans love lukewarm halfbaked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills,negative
someone get me my lithium,negative
heres a rarity a childrens film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject is there a god,negative
done well it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern childrens cinema,negative
unfortunately it isnt,negative
with jumbled messages and an unclear audience wide awake was better left asleep,negative
fifth grader joshua beal joseph cross is in the middle of a moral crisis,negative
his beloved grandfather robert loggia has died and joshua has begun a quest,negative
he wants to find god to discover why bad things happen,negative
this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents dana delany and denis leary but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths,negative
at his catholic school his favorite teacher sister terry rosie odonnell tries to give him guidance but this is a journey he must make on his own,negative
meanwhile he is having the most momentous year of his life,negative
he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave timothy reifsnyder he gets his first crush and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey,negative
it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be,negative
on its surface it appears to be a kids film,negative
however it deals with serious issues and is likely to be boring for todays instantgratification kids,negative
and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience wide awake asks serious questions but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer,negative
if there were a bit more meat in the story adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie,negative
the actors who might have created a great cast odonnell leary and delany are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos,negative
the nostalgic elements best friend favorite teacher first crush etc have been done much better in other movies and actually seem more like filler here,negative
the films strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshuas relationship with his grandfather,negative
they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie,negative
maybe the film would have been better if instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks it were set entirely during joshuas last year with his grandpa,negative
it certainly would have been more entertaining,negative
wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment,negative
it starts out with noble aspirations but never delivers on its promise,negative
parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions that is if their kids arent bored to death first,negative
if only austin powers the spy who shagged me had been just half as original zany silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor it would have easily been one of this summers biggest pleasures,negative
if only,negative
in fact the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another the filmmakers bombard us with usedup tired jokes taken directly from the first one,negative
take the scene where austin powers again played by mike myers but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff,negative
after being pushed off the ravine the bad guy is of course assumed dead,negative
but suddenly we hear a pleading voice coming from down below hes only injured,negative
a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery but here i was insulted by it,negative
did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a ripoff,negative
apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average moviegoer considering that the film has pulled in over 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone,negative
do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way,negative
having said that though i still cannot deny the film its merits,negative
the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat dr evil mike myers in the second of his three roles having constructed a time machine goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin powers mojo dont you just love that word,negative
whilst he is cryogenically frozen,negative
when austin gets wind of this after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurleys vanessa kensington he too travels back in time to reclaim his sexual drive accompanied by the hottotrot felicity shagwell played by heather graham,negative
this sounds stupid i know but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird offthewall sense and it worked for me,negative
then theres minime verne troyer a,negative
petite clone of myers dr evil exactly 18 in size,negative
troyers persona alone gains the film an extra halfstar contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own minimr,negative
bigglesworth,negative
just try to ignore the fact that at 28 he would make dr evils height rise to just over 21 feet,negative
no matter,negative
however there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half the most notable being the now infamous tent scene and that just isnt enough to warrant even a minor recommendation,negative
if there is in fact an austin powers 3 they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr evil and minime,negative
unconventional yes but theres no denying that itd make for a better movie,negative
forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects,negative
set in 1692 at salem massachusetts the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon,negative
they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells,negative
then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes,negative
not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor daniel day lewis abigail winona ryder suddenly seizes a chicken beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood,negative
taking even adolescent hormone surges into account surely this chickenbashing bit is a bit excessive especially for prim puritan sensibilities,negative
surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets,negative
the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur millers name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play,negative
this is far from a harmless event a bad start to an already shaky morality tale,negative
the play describes the films opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply and this adds to the plays charged atmosphere,negative
in the film the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandoras box,negative
not only is credulity stretched but abigails obsession is unfortunately spotlighted,negative
it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot,negative
not surprisingly the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning witches are invoked by those eager to blame,negative
when the girls are questioned their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses led lustfully by abigail,negative
with alarming synchronicity our hormonallyadvantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents constant reminders that abigails passion sets all this into inexorable motion,negative
abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctors love his wife elizabeth joan allen by including her among those accused of witchcraft,negative
appropriately narrowwaisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an overearnestness that longs to be watched,negative
director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foamingmouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration,negative
otherwise hytners direction is unremarkable,negative
ryders performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings,negative
her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful,negative
abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here,negative
paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves,negative
probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing allens elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character,negative
a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed,negative
unfortunately when johns audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost,negative
it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions,negative
his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message,negative
the result is a clumsy muddle i felt like the chicken from the opening scene head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavyhanded to be wholly believable,negative
when the gallows beckoned it was sweet release indeed,negative
far from bewitching the crucible tests the patience,negative
alcohol and drugs bad,negative
not alcohol and drugs good,negative
got it,negative
just when you though youve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen be that insanity or alcoholism hollywood releases yet another one of those deep emotional stories about finding yourself,negative
28 days is practically a visualization of the usual meaningful true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aameetings,negative
gwennie sandra bullock is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol,negative
for her life was a big party with no beginning and no end,negative
this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself,negative
her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes,negative
such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper dominic west borrowed her sisters elizabeth perkins wedding limo and crashed it into someones house,negative
this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in courtordered rehab,negative
here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption willpower and commitment,negative
most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party,negative
the film itself feels like a rehab program whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times,negative
it is a classic cautionary tale,negative
an echo,negative
a big fat and expensive clich,negative
a shadow of last years girl interrupted which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like the cuckoos nest and trainspotting,negative
director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review,negative
for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a,negative
jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues alienation despair terror confusion loneliness,negative
and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean,negative
isnt that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place,negative
even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park betty thomas idea of hell is a cozy homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke drink or watch tv after 11,negative
it is simply too light simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously,negative
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance,negative
that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story,negative
all you need to do is just say no says dr cornell steve buscemi as if was the revelation of the century,negative
and thats how simple it is,negative
in fact i would rather watch lost in space once again than return to 28 days,negative
as for acting its acceptable but hardly anything else,negative
for sandra bullock its an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than speed,negative
she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop,negative
dominic west shines as the source of gwenies devilish temptations but elizabeth perkins and steve buscemis great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters,negative
although intellectually girl interrupted was a greater achievement 28 days is superior in its visual aspect,negative
there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor,negative
the most important thing is that weve seen it before and it was a lot better,negative
clean and sober only when i laugh when a man loves a woman leaving las vegas and many other stronger films were made about the same issues,negative
so whats the point,negative
in other words 28 days doesnt contribute to the moviemaking business on any level,negative
if youre caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and youre standing in front of the movie theatre you might as well go in and watch 28 days,negative
under all other circumstances stay away because this film equals 8 and 103 minutes lost,negative
capsule one of the ten worst movies ever made,negative
christopher lambert vs evil ninjas in modernday japan,negative
and nobody wins,negative
the hunted is such a bad movie so completely inept and so totally braindamaged that i could almost feel affection for it,negative
i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it if it werent also insanely xenophobic and insulting,negative
christopher lambert plays a computerparts salesman whos on business in japan,negative
he meets a slinky young woman joan chen and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader john lone,negative
apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered,negative
since lambert is a witness hes of course the next one to die,negative
lets stop and think about this for a second,negative
if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society hed have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock,negative
in this movie the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him,negative
i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body,negative
you know what a goof field is that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is,negative
this is of course only the beginning of the movies problems,negative
lambert eventually finds pseudosafety with a longhaired modernday samurai yoshio harada and his partner yoko shimada who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun,negative
they are the two best things in the movie in every scene they have authority and presence and they actually look like they belong here even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows,negative
the script doesnt know what the hell to do with them,negative
lone as the bad guy is zerodimensional,negative
the only badguy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him,negative
in the hunted this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype,negative
whats funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes theres a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver and a girl in a pachinko parlor but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful,negative
also the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack get the cd that manages to survive despite the drek its been designed to accompany,negative
there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing a gory excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment and then smothers it by trying to clumsily recouple the whole thing with the movies relentlessly stupid plot,negative
by the time we get to the final showdown with lambert getting to wield his own sword which judging from the hamhanded editing of one scene was forged in seven hours or so we no longer care,negative
were not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies,negative
someone once said that the key to good art good movies good books whatever is to start somewhere interesting end up somewhere interesting and show respect for the audience all along the way,negative
this movie bungles two out of three badly,negative
the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film the world is not enough is its final frame white letters on a black background proclaiming james bond will return,negative
oh i certainly hope not,negative
with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last goround as james bond 007 the world is not enough is the best example to date that enough is enough,negative
in this the 19th chapter in the seeminglyendless franchise featuring ian flemings debonair british secret agent who likes his martinisand his nemesesshaken not stirred the subinspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups stunts and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original,negative
weve got previouslyused speedboat chases ski chases and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines,negative
weve got a couple of hottotrot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them,negative
weve got a postcold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean lean panache,negative
and as has been the case since 1977s the spy who loved me weve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr fleming,negative
weve also got a main title song by garbage to which with very little effort you can fit the lyrics to both songs from tomorrow never dies,negative
while originality was never the series strong suit the films were almost always fun with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts,negative
i cant think of one memorable setpiece in the entireand very dull the world is not enough,negative
in addition michael apted yes the respected director of such films as coal miners daughter nell and the 28up documentary series takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich s,negative
you get the talking killer plot deviceyou know the scenario the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age,negative
and you get a slew of highpriced assassins who cant hit a barn door at 20 paces in the films opening minutes of an endless 128 bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leatherclad lovely fails to hit bonds soupedup fishing boat with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her,negative
later she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out,negative
these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles vodka or credit cards,negative
in and among the rampant product placements brosnan grapples with carlyle braveheart s sophie marceau as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king shes terrible wild things denise richards as a nuclear physicist lord help me shes laughable and judi dench as m dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its selfrespect about the time roger moore inherited bonds walther ppk,negative
brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm youd expect of the former remington steele star but even he has to be thinking theres more to life than an easy paycheck,negative
hes given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver but only one of them i dont know any doctor jokes made me chuckle although i thought christmas only comes once a year is more in keeping with the series penchant for grownworthy puns,negative
at first glance i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise,negative
its plotline goes like this the evil king cromwell desiring to take over the world resurrects an evil ancient sorceror xusia for power,negative
he attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents,negative
given a triplebladed sword which can shoot bad guys like a gun by his dying father talon vows for revenge,negative
eleven years later when hes established his own army the mercaneries he vows to take back his kingdom,negative
along the way he meets up with alana whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell,negative
talon vows to help and after a series of minor escapades eventually ends up rescuing alanas brother and several other prisoners only to be captured himself in other words put on a cross to be crucified,negative
fortunately he frees himself rescues alana from marrying cromwell defeats xusia and then cromwell all with his triple bladed sword during the final battle the blade breaks but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade,negative
then everything ends happily,negative
unfortunately the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds,negative
what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping bad acting and gruesomely gory bloody scenes,negative
never once does the story seem to connect together it just jumps around repeatedly,negative
this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia,negative
after telling him that he needs his help he leads the warlock out into daylight but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards,negative
wait a minute didnt the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade ehdan which he cannot do by military force,negative
if that is the case why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him,negative
and why does he manage to take over ehdan anyway,negative
these questions are just never no never answered in the film,negative
another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alanas wedding to cromwell and finally at the end instead of settling down with alana he just tells her to wait and then he just rides off,negative
in addition to the extremely bloody scenes this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure,negative
even some attempts to make it exciting a few fire scenes battle scenes dont work,negative
it just completely fails altogether miserably,negative
the only good thing about this film is its musical score contributed by david whittaker who had an extremely short music composing career,negative
the score is boomy and adventurous powerful and a billion times better than this film is,negative
my suggestion steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead if you can find it,negative
ironically though before the films credits roll there is a message indicating that a sequel tales of the ancient empire would follow,negative
to my relief and delight it never got into production because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office grossing only 39 million,negative
critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer all right,negative
leonard maltin rightfully called it second rate in scripting and acting and ataglance film reviews called it a confusing stupid unimaginative unengaging bloodfilled bore,negative
i totally agree with these reviews all right and i hope that this piece of,negative
will be forgotten about,negative
there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer,negative
i hope you get a good laugh out of this review but i am not laughing,negative
in fact my insults dont even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time,negative
the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission,negative
he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth but misses,negative
after they ricochet off his face he says not a good start,negative
as it turns out this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence but to the rest of the movie as well,negative
in this the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong chan plays an international operative codenamed condor and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazis during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war,negative
for some reason condor is given his mission at the u s embassy in spain,negative
i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart,negative
watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country most notably in europe,negative
the chase will take itself through a marketplace and a fruit cart will be overturned,negative
its almost a guarantee,negative
anyway,negative
condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly,negative
to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly condor is accompanied by a desert expert carol cheng and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold eva cobo,negative
there arent supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something,negative
although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts,negative
in fact most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight,negative
i suppose this isnt so bad since chans action is really the best part of the movie and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway,negative
if youve never seen a jackie chan movie dont expect a great plot but do expect to be entertained by his moves,negative
they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human,negative
knowing that he does his own stunts and knowing that this is the real stuff no computermasked bungee cords here makes the action sequences all the more exciting,negative
youve got to hand it to a guy whos probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art,negative
also of note in this as in any jackie chan movie is the humor,negative
as far as i know none of his films take themselves too seriously and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongueincheek quality about them,negative
what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes,negative
unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme where the fights get you on the visceral level fight scenes in chans movies are simply entertaining,negative
you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh,negative
unfortunately even chans mastery cant save this film,negative
the plot and characters are so weak that they dont hold the movie together at all and the acting is terrible,negative
carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off,negative
this combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying,negative
claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists but theyre just about the only palatable element of the mod squad a lamebrained bigscreen version of the 70s tv show,negative
the story has all the originality of a block of wood well it would if you could decipher it the characters are all blank slates and scott silvers perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come,negative
by sheer force of talent the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever theyre on screen but the mod squad is just a secondrate action picture with a firstrate cast,negative
theres a good and timely story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first a new movie about the abuses of our prison system,negative
with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy this expose would offer something rare to recent american moviesa point of view,negative
but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious often nauseating camera movements and slick mtv style lighting and editing are far more important,negative
theres not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling,negative
and everything suffers,negative
christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate respectively,negative
after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial,negative
his young lawyer slater is fresh out of law school but determined to put alcatraz on trial for the abuses of it warden gary oldman,negative
the result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students,negative
theres very little to praise here outside of kevin bacons earnest overacting and the appropriate story,negative
theres a lot of overacting from everyoneyou know youre in trouble right away when r lee ermey the drill sergeant in full metal jacket is cast as a judge the center of reason and moderation,negative
slater has never been convincing and certainly isnt here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances,negative
but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story,negative
there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters let alone with them,negative
how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions,negative
if theres anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world it is our ability to tell a good story,negative
have we forgotten,negative
a followup to disneys liveaction 101 dalmatians thats better more entertaining than the first,negative
just as unlikely,negative
with 102 dalmatians the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely not the merrier,negative
1996s 101 dalmatians certainly wasnt the greatest moviegoing experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous largerthanlife performance,negative
in addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies,negative
this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen and closes facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53yearold actress under that startling black and white wig of hers,negative
but thats only half the problem with kevin limas laborious film,negative
what makes 102 dalmatians such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor here almost singlehandedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks hes a dog voiced by eric idle its rabid plotlessness cruella goes after puppies again winds up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic heroes of the piece a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blanderthanbland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo,negative
gruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans cant even aspire to that,negative
the dogs upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even closes split ends are more animated,negative
bad acting however seems to be a requirement for this sequel since g rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niros in men of honor,negative
jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieus overthetop antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail,negative
frances most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself and in 102 dalmatians the producers milk that realization for all its worthle pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as poopies par example and ad nauseum,negative
the finesses of the script attributed to four screenwriters no less and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben,negative
that done its back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore offlimits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown,negative
the dogs are pretty cutetry making a puppy look otherwisebut thats pretty much all they are,negative
theres always the feeling that theres a trainer off in the wings coaxing the dogs to open doors or pick up their food bowls in unison or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder,negative
savvy holiday goers should skip 102 dalmatians and pop the original 1961 animated classic into their vcrs instead,negative
its one dalmatian less but 101 more satisfying,negative
i didnt hate the big hit even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film,negative
for the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached to the screen and i never once got bored,negative
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such a confused disaster of a film that its entertaining to watch it in the same way that its entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl,negative
as a narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries,negative
it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways,negative
its fine to mix genres if the film makers know what theyre doing,negative
unfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong dont seem to know how to handle the material and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy,negative
the biggest problem with the amalgamation in this case is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place,negative
but it sure is a fascinating failure,negative
marky,negative
er mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley a hitman,negative
hes a good hitman apparently although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious he doesnt snipe or make clean killshe just kicks the door down and shoots everything,negative
he works with a few other hitmencisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr,negative
theyre a nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex,negative
they all work for a man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen,negative
it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in,negative
they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has a rich father,negative
when they do this it turns out she is paris,negative
goddaughter,negative
its very bad to have paris against you,negative
the story is standard action film stuff,negative
its nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling,negative
clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that its a john wootype of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy,negative
its true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as and the replacement killers which are both far superior,negative
there are stunts that are fun to watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story,negative
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns,negative
melvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives,negative
like i said its not boring most disasters arent,negative
what makes it so bad is its genreshifting madness,negative
it seems to start out as a quirkybutrealistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains,negative
then as soon as they go to their first hit it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere,negative
then somewhere in between it turns back into comedy,negative
keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced to read a letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words,negative
and scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious or not be in the film at all,negative
one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him to find the perpetrator,negative
the scene is played for laughs but it isnt funny,negative
and since it doesnt quite work as a comedy it tries to fall back on the action which also fails,negative
this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun,negative
cars land on tree branches and are supported by them,negative
characters betray each other without a second thought,negative
grenades are thrown in tight places,negative
people jump out of tall buildings and survive,negative
people outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds,negative
most frustrating of all though is the films definition of a hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals,negative
theyre more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and handheld machineguns,negative
the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously doesnt make for deep or interesting people to watch,negative
the acting is kind of fun thoughwahlberg is a good actor and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way,negative
phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvins fianc e is convincingly airheaded,negative
the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny,negative
the funniest parts are supplied by the actors and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and oneliners,negative
its a true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional,negative
despite all this though i must reiterate the entertainment value here,negative
you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this,negative
if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself,negative
boy what a great movie,negative
keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together the director of the fugitive andrew davis back again to give us another thriller and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot,negative
how could this not be a blockbuster,negative
all diehard keanu reeves fans read on,negative
ol much ado about nothing plays eddie kasalivich a machinist studying at the university of chicago,negative
to help pay for the rent he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university,negative
by happy coincidence he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics,negative
this project holds great promise taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in,negative
a potential solution to the earths energy problems without the pollution cost,negative
surely nobody could have any problems with that,negative
morgan freeman is paul shannon the projects sponsor,negative
he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public,negative
he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly,negative
so he murders the project leader blows up the project great but short scene here sort of like a mini id4 citydevastation thing and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hitech hushhush location,negative
unfortunately our intrepid machinist and an english physicist weisz manage to get away and now follows a fugitivelike chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script,negative
this movie is just dying for a comparison with the fugitive,negative
both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesnt change much i guess we cant really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere,negative
the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward,negative
credit to them but we arent really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters,negative
where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop,negative
it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences which frankly get quite boring after a while,negative
harrison ford was the man against the world,negative
he was alone in a world where he didnt know who to trust and it came across real well,negative
in chain reaction keanu reeves isnt alone,negative
now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia vulnerability and confusion,negative
we dont get this,negative
we get him thinking hes still in speed only now our sandra bullock has an english accent probably doesnt drive a bus and hardly contributes anything to the movie,negative
the producers here probably thought hey what if keanu and rachel dont hit it off too well,negative
lets rope in that morgan to help us out,negative
well keanu and rachel didnt hit it off well on the screen and most unfortunately morgan freeman doesnt help much either,negative
the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder,negative
its not really his fault,negative
once again andrew davis just doesnt take the time to build his characters,negative
someone must have convinced him that this time round cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken,negative
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
so its thirty years later and oscar and felix are together again,negative
that might have been an exciting notion if it wasnt for the fact that the odd couple of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies 1993s grumpy old men 1995s grumpier old men and 1997s out to sea i e,negative
grumpiest old men,negative
so the odd couple ii i e,negative
the grumpiest old men of all really seems just another entry in a tired series,negative
the plot is even similar to that of grumpy old men in that lemmon and matthaus mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children,negative
oscars son jonathan silverman and felixs daughter lisa waltz are getting married and former roommates felix ungar lemmon and oscar madison matthau meet at the airport and decide to share a car,negative
then hilarity ensues,negative
well a few chuckles ensue anyway,negative
neil simon the awardwinning playwright who created oscar and felix provides the screenplay which is a shock because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end,negative
unlike the original odd couple ii doesnt find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters,negative
instead it depends upon a series of humorous situations oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff are caught smuggling mexicans over the border take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands the women are played by christine baranski of cybill and jean smart of designing women and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert,negative
the original 1968 movie the odd couple remains a classic comedy,negative
it introduced the motif of roommateasspouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since,negative
it was the second outing for the team which debuted in 1966s the fortune cookie and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies the front page 1974 and buddy buddy 1981 before going their separate ways,negative
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in grumpy old men six years ago was delightful and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie,negative
but out to sea and the odd couple ii are just beating a grumpy old horse,negative
you can add lemmons my fellow americans i e,negative
grumpy old presidents to that list too,negative
lets hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do,negative
lets hope also that we see neil simons name on movies that do it justice this is his first since 1993s lost in yonkers,negative
for better or worse the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated oversexed underwritten thrillers,negative
apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesnt change a thing since body of evidence wasnt written by him but has a puzzling eszterhasish presence all over it,negative
in other words its a really dirty and b really really stupid,negative
madonna first warning sign stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around seminaked presumably for the edification of the shrimp,negative
shes been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover,negative
already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless shes under thirty or at least looks it and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men,negative
whats worse is that the movie confirms all the above and wallows in them as well,negative
madonnas character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition,negative
and yes there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy,negative
this movie leave no scummy stone unturned,negative
anyway willem dafoe very good but completely wasted also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonnas sexuality,negative
how do we know this,negative
because his character is set up with the token wife and kids,negative
how obvious is it that hes gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up,negative
and get kicked out of the house,negative
and get welcomed back anyway,negative
dont skip to the end yet were just getting warmed up,negative
dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie,negative
most of it is about as erotic as openheart surgery since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax always the kink of choice among screenwriters who dont know the first thing about really kinky sex and smashed light bulbs,negative
dont ask,negative
another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story its insanely dull,negative
whats worse is that body of evidence is dull everywhere not just in the sex scenes,negative
the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninthhand from other bad courtroom drama scenes,negative
the thriller business itself is ridiculous it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor,negative
and the ending another homage to eszterhas maybe,negative
is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact frame where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in,negative
the director is uli edel all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f everyone has to eat i guess but this isnt a meal ticket its leftovers,negative
theres no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based as its opening credits proclaim on a true story,negative
but if its an accurate picture of life on americas mean streets than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought,negative
for from the films outset when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction,negative
our eponymous hero johnny depp is not the cheap crook he first appears to be,negative
brasco is joseph pistone an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chummingup to lefty al pacino a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a wiseguy,negative
regrettably pistone learns his lessons all too well,negative
his concern for lefty who is burdened with a heroin addicted son exacerbates his own family troubles his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husbands gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing,negative
true the focus on pistones family life does deviate from the typical gangsterflick formula but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins,negative
the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawnout domestic squabbles including an illadvised marriage guidance routine that slow the film down unnecessarily,negative
the biggest problem with donnie brasco however is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors,negative
the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70s but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style i loved those fluoro coloured suits of scorces costume drama casino,negative
more importantly pacinos presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively,negative
donnie brascos take on american values for instance is feeble and obvious,negative
lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music,negative
inexplicably leftys horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us,negative
it doesnt any more than his family troubles do which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistones,negative
just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface,negative
in these pictures pacinos dedication to a peculiar and bloody hypercapitalism was twisted and confronting while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations,negative
donnie brascos tawdry little crime therefore isnt so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes but the shameless way in which it sanitises them,negative
oh and by the way i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot pipstones superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination is that a damn you mcbain,negative
i hear from springfield way,negative
so the movie is cliched,negative
big deal what do you expect from a gangsterflick,negative
well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre,negative
donnie brasco fails on both counts,negative
the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depps woeful performance tends to smother the goodwork of his comrades,negative
admittedly pacino does nothing new and michael madsen sonny simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr white but both possess an unmistakable sly charm,negative
depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself but regrettably being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him starstruck for he is completely hellbent on mimicking pacinos wellearned high style,negative
the consequences are painful to watch,negative
its no exaggeration to say that the films credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone familys uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinners phony brooklyn accent,negative
perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco,negative
maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks,negative
if this is indeed the case surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that americas underworld is committed to emulating albeit in heavily attenuated form their movie namesakes,negative
depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic bigscreen gangster greats,negative
who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen,negative
but then again perhaps donnie brasco isnt so true after all,negative
the generals daughter is a heartless absurd film a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters,negative
director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with hamhanded obscenity creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudodepth,negative
whats worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm,negative
john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell,negative
brenner is teamed up with exspouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe and they check out all the suspects on the base including elizabeths mentor colonel moore james woods,negative
soon it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff but the question comes down to why and of course who,negative
eberts law of the economy of characters can be applied here one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point including the two protagonists but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story,negative
perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that but its painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something,negative
on a story level the generals daughter is ineptly constructed,negative
the film adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demilles novel which was apparently based on a true story plods along to its conclusion filling in the blanks with stale unrealistic dialogue and shocking plot developments,negative
having not read the novel its difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree,negative
scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity minutes after finding the dead young woman brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue which includes endless strings of forced lines,negative
sunderland actually asks brenner why was she killed,negative
to which i would have answered if i knew then the movie would already be over,negative
only after weve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together this angle though apparently present to develop their characters is never explored,negative
not that it really matters since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot,negative
in one scene sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask,negative
she sees one of his rings and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring,negative
instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect they take him to brenners houseboat beat him up and pour hot coffee in his lap,negative
this scene really pushed me over the edge not because its gratuitous and meanspirited but because it illustrates the films complete disregard for the characters and the audience,negative
it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise,negative
i realized that these constructs on screen arent actually characters but devices present only to serve the story,negative
this would have been bad enough without the wests need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct,negative
compelling films about sexual crimes dont spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks and they certainly dont show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture,negative
these scenes are not the least bit powerful on the contrary theyre intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain whomever that may turn out to be,negative
in addition the movie treats sexual fetishes and sadomasochism in particular as if its a perversion of everything we know to be pure,negative
this standpoint is certainly allowed but only in accompaniment with welldeveloped themes to back it up,negative
as it is the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane,negative
perhaps the only positive elements in the generals daughter are a couple of the performances,negative
james woods has a few terrific scenes and plays his role with sharp witty subtlety,negative
i also liked james cromwell mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous,negative
nonetheless these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization,negative
the generals daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film it pretends to have a soul to be of strict moral code when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cutouts forcefeeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and onesided moral judgments,negative
phaedra cinema the distributor of such neverheardof classics as soft toilet seats trailer the movie and the one armed boxer vs the flying guillotine has sneaked its latest release the sculptress into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare,negative
the sculptress is a scary proposition all right but not in the way its producers intended,negative
from the outset its easy to see why some of the larger more reputable chains arent carrying it the film looks like a straighttovideo release from the early 80s thats been dusted off not very carefully and reissued in theatrical format,negative
that staple of schlocky zmovies jeff fahey the lawnmower man plays a washedup shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills,negative
when hes not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment screaming scotchinduced hamlet soliloquies well into the night hes out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women,negative
faheys dobie sizes up his victims actually just one a peep show performer name of sylvie dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane dark glasses and a false beard just in time for halloween,negative
do you have a castle,negative
sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop,negative
jah,negative
with ze many turrets is dobies perplexing reply,negative
the real star of the film and i use that term extremely loosely is katie wright who plays the sculptress of the title,negative
sarah is new in town studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a genius frenchman played by the beretwearing patrick bauchau,negative
thats convenient because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris you wont believe the films final shot with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and rosemarys baby inspired imagery,negative
bauchaus character criticizes sarahs work publicly her clay busts keep turning into gargoylesperhaps shes possessed,negative
by an incubus but he still manages to talk her into dinner,negative
whereas wright does a decent english accent her talents pretty much end there,negative
on the other side of the wall dobies troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like actor delivers a stunning macbeth actor courted by hollywood studio actor renounces hollywood for priesthood and prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal,negative
the films plot could have been just as easily condensed,negative
artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath,negative
yawns ensue,negative
so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes,negative
late in the film their paths finally cross with mindnumbing results,negative
nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket but one old dear does go ballistic when sarahs bathtub overflows,negative
no we dont see wright in the tub or fahey for that matter and the gore quotient is virtually nil so for a horror film the sculptress is surprisingly lacking,negative
the only thing worth looking at is san francisco and ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary windswept and deserted,negative
the sculptress isnt even bad enough to be fun,negative
luckily a limited release has made it easy to avoid,negative
battlefield earth is the best comedy of the year,negative
it has to be,negative
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider,negative
bad movie syndrome struck me again so after witnessing how much battlefield earth has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firsthand,negative
is it as bad as advertised,negative
oh yes very much so,negative
the plot is incomprehensible,negative
the acting is atrocious,negative
the special effects are mediocre,negative
the action is dull,negative
the implausibilities are legion,negative
the dialogue is cringeinducing,negative
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny,negative
i dont even want to continue reviewing this movie id like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is,negative
the premise is basically a ripoff of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo,negative
the year is 3000 the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved,negative
only a handful of humans escaped to radiationrich areas to escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear,negative
one man johnny goodboy i know i know tyler barry pepper ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos,negative
there he confronts the psychlo head of security a big ugly klingonlooking creature called terl john travolta,negative
pressed into slavery johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back,negative
meanwhile terl is faced with his own problems he has recently learned that hes stuck living on earth which he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big mans daughter,negative
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous,negative
so the mananimal can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos cant go,negative
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself,negative
of course his plan doesnt work,negative
so many things wrong with this movie where to begin,negative
how about with travolta whose hollywood clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru l ron hubbards scifi novel,negative
early previews for battlefield earth with constant shots of a makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking,negative
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks,negative
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo,negative
of course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary,negative
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally dont laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees,negative
you were going to be promoted but now youre not,negative
fwahahahahahahahaha,negative
its no big surprise terl loses to the humans hes an idiot,negative
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book,negative
he underestimates his enemies assuming hell win just because hes smarter,negative
he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra,negative
not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology,negative
why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me,negative
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him,negative
no wonder this guy never got his promotion,negative
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention,negative
why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive,negative
how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open,negative
how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 000 years,negative
and how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly,negative
theres a whole lot more to scratch ones head about in battlefield earth,negative
bring a scorecard to track the plot holes,negative
director roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason,negative
all the characters appear to be standing on the walls and its awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue,negative
the action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement,negative
are these things really so hard to construct,negative
my respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot,negative
this movie is an absolute headache,negative
its not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense,negative
for most of battlefield earths running time i just didnt know what was happening,negative
it didnt have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are i really had no idea what the hell was going on,negative
when i pieced the plot together later it didnt look any better,negative
heres how much of a disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and its going to take something really really inept to top it,negative
the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it,negative
in fact id think that hubbards cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible,negative
thatll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again,negative
ive heard it called jaws with claws and thats a fair summation of the plot though that tag line does little to quantify quality,negative
director stephen hopkins blown away predator 2 and screenwriter william goldman maverick misery would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century,negative
theyve stacked the deck with two big stars val kilmer michael douglas a bigger production design beautiful photography by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music,negative
the movie doesnt make a lick of sense though either as an epic or as your basic boofest,negative
in fact some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think youve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 the movie,negative
how about the three guys with rifles who trap a lion and then cant even hit the damned thing,negative
or the hamonwry acting of michael douglas who chews more scenery than the animals ever do,negative
or my favorite lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops,negative
much ado about nothing,negative
ah how sweet the irony,negative
its accepted wisdom in some circles among english literature nuts mainly that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance,negative
he just doesnt understand shakespeare you will hear them say,negative
the bards work is apparently beyond criticism,negative
what a load of old cobblers,negative
if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaughs film of shakespeares comedy much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word its time to get a life,negative
get monty python,negative
get woody allen,negative
get john waters,negative
whatever,negative
just get a real taste of some clever witty risky comedy,negative
and banish this nonsense to where it belongs,negative
drama and tragedy was shakespeares strength,negative
to my sensibilities and im no stick in the mud much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever,negative
no kidding this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going,negative
the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend as this was our day out and i hadnt seen her in ages,negative
but boy does she owe me one,negative
i wont spend too much time on the plot,negative
basically we follow the trials and tribulations of two wouldbe couples one young the other older,negative
theres some dark treachery amongst all this but everyone is so awfully jolly that youd hardly know it,negative
mind you theres nothing wrong with the basic story,negative
good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound,negative
nothing wrong with most of the cast either,negative
branaugh emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers,negative
the problem is the script or more accurately shakespeares original text,negative
light comedy shouldnt be complex,negative
yet wrapped in elizabethan english the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend,negative
for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good undemanding laugh,negative
the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves the actor once again miscast as a jealous halfbrother or something,negative
but when dissected and understood what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame,negative
this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold,negative
ho ho ho boy likes girl,negative
ho ho ho men are such klutzes,negative
ho ho ho shes so awfully clumsy,negative
oh please,negative
theres wit in here somewhere im told,negative
i call it pretentious,negative
something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay,negative
in the end its cringeworthy,negative
watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience,negative
comedy,negative
bah humbug,negative
the first film produced by adam sandlers happy madison production company clever title eh is essentially a one joke movie much like the movies sandler stars in himself,negative
however the difference here is that this one joke just isnt very funny,negative
rob schneider stars as the title character a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a manwhore to raise enough money to replace a wealthy clients custom made fish tank which deuce destroyed while staying in his home,negative
deuce goes on numerous dates and each woman he goes out with has a humorous quirk about herself,negative
one has narcolepsy one has tourettes syndrome one is a man,negative
etc etc,negative
my problem is that we see all of these women in the films trailer so why do i need to watch the movie,negative
seen the trailer,negative
seen the film,negative
only a quick cameo from norm macdonald and a follow up joke during the closing credits generates any chuckles,negative
deuce bigalow male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video a division of diney,negative
the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and features the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for mystery alaska happy texas and outside providence an extremely brief production featurette which contains footage not used in the film and storyboardtoscene comparisons,negative
yep you read that right,negative
there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd,negative
two scenes are storyboarded,negative
neither of which are particularly exciting,negative
there are fight scenes in this movie so why arent we seeing storyboards of those segments especially the parody moments from the matrix,negative
i wonder whats funnier the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that diney thought fans of this film would want to see them,negative
deleted scenes,negative
sure,negative
audio commentary,negative
you betcha,negative
but storyboards,negative
come on,negative
r,negative
in my review of the spy who shagged me i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series it is followed by a third movie that is a bore,negative
the cause is probably complacency a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing,negative
scream 3 provides the latest proof of this rule,negative
in los angeles production has begun on stab 3 return to woodsboro the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott neve campbell,negative
however life soon starts imitating art and stab cast members turn up stabbed,negative
smelling yet another book deal gale weathers courteney cox arquette comes to the set to investigate and finds her exboyfriend dewey riley david arquette acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer parker posey the actress playing gale in stab 3 elsewhere our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name,negative
until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice,negative
the late randy meeks jamie kennedy makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy,negative
he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with,negative
indeed scream 3 tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all the murder of sidneys mother maureen before the beginning of the original scream,negative
at the scene of each murder in scream 3 the killer leaves a photo of sidneys mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer,negative
to find out who the killer is our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureens missing years when she was a starlet appearing in lowbudget horror films,negative
even with that little information you can probably already guess what the killers relationship to sidney is,negative
unlike its predecessors scream 3 doesnt have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer,negative
the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped so that by the end we dont even care who the killer is,negative
the jaded detective patrick dempsey,negative
the kinky producer lance henriksen,negative
the driven young director scott foley,negative
the ingenue emily mortimer,negative
the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random,negative
wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret so its quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen,negative
the series trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious,negative
possibly its the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson who penned the first two or maybe its that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche,negative
i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first scream was repeated momentformoment in the hollywood set of her home,negative
at some point referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas,negative
scream 3 also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles,negative
look for jenny mccarthy carrie fisher patrick warburton puddy from seinfeld roger corman and jason mewes and kevin smith as jay and silent bob to walk through at some point,negative
all these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars who are probably saving their energy for the long post scream job search,negative
another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass more movies are copying the blair witch project s web strategy,negative
scream 3 has three official websites that wink wink pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie,negative
the sunrise studios site scream3 com has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the latest stab 3 news,negative
theres also a gail weathers official site galeweathers com and a sunrise sucks site that has more stab scandals the studio wants to cover up sunrisesucks com,negative
craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the scream series,negative
while i hope thats true i dont hold out much hopehorror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters,negative
theres a halloween h2k in the works even though michael myers was beheaded in h20 and a freddy vs jason has been talked about for awhile despite the fact that both characters were killed off,negative
theres bound to be a scream 4 someday even if it starts over with a new set of moviestar wannabes,negative
bottom line they should have called this one yawn,negative
capsule dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones,negative
basic instincts worst crime is that its not just a bad movie but in many ways an incompetent one as well,negative
its stupid in itself and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is,negative
its supposed to be a thriller but the plot is dead on its feet and ultimately arbitrary its only put into the movie to jerk us around,negative
its also supposed to be sexy but its instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures,negative
its a ripoff,negative
the story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm,negative
the biggest suspect is an authoress catherine tramell sharon stone who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged,negative
or maybe its the work of a copycat,negative
these and other plot threads get fed to the detective whos on the case michael douglas who has a few problems himself,negative
like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor,negative
we can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance,negative
joe eszterhas has written the screenplay and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge the killers identity is kept a secret until the movies final shot,negative
this isnt in itself a problem the problem is that up until that point weve been given nothing to work with,negative
every clue in the movie every clue is ambiguous,negative
the whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill,negative
red herrings dead plot threads violence and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets,negative
they add up to zip because theyre not happening to people we care about,negative
douglass character is foulmouthed and bitter and thats it stones character has an ironon smile that never changes the rest are forgettable,negative
when we dont even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie who cares what happens in it,negative
especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying but in many ways inexplicable,negative
a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know or would care to know just leave,negative
one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someones life but as a kind of kink something to thrill men with,negative
i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a bigbudget hollywood film is as a hefnerism,negative
one of these days ill make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie,negative
king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single emotive viewing his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary arthouse trappings,negative
its a perfumedrenched cokeaddled visit to the seedy pornography shop where beautiful models no hookers no courtesans usher you through the silk curtains,negative
ferraras only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever hes onscreen,negative
his 8minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal unwatchable and pretentious failure,negative
when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch theres a muchneeded dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair,negative
you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know theyre actually having fun,negative
the addiction is that movie,negative
walken sadly does not appear in the blackout,negative
the central role of matty a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction is played by matthew modine who takes what he can get after cutthroat island,negative
much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonionis terminally bored cultural elite matty is involved in a bitter pill relationship with high fashioned model annie at least i think shes a model,negative
mattys lady is played by french actress b atrice dalle arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout not that you needed to know that but it lends credence to the idea that ferraras entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout,negative
no kidding,negative
requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferraras movies and his controversial urban lifestyle,negative
matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him,negative
no doubt he was off chasing the dragon,negative
in his despair matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne dennis hopper in full dirty ol man mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs,negative
wider,negative
toward the end of the night they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie sarah lassez start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene then matty thankfully blacks out,negative
something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie and its exactly what you think it was,negative
suffice to say theres some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two or anyone at all,negative
the blackout is typical ferrara no plot to speak of plenty of raunch and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a seethrough curtain in his hotel room by the sea by the sea by the beautiful sea,negative
cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docustyle sleaze and were back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits,negative
yeah,negative
yeah,negative
arrrghhh,negative
says mr hopper,negative
dirty old sod,negative
its compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny,negative
hows that for cryptic,negative
never fear ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what hes all about,negative
i can picture it now,negative
take off yer clothes kid its essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist and youre his visual id,negative
youre the soul the heart the bloodstream of the picture,negative
take it off,negative
take it all off,negative
ha ha ha,negative
friggin vampire,negative
yeah you ferrara,negative
a final word about matthew modine hes actually a fine actor when properly cast but theres something too squeakyclean in his demeanor,negative
hes ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the timebomb nebbish in short cuts who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene though no one seems to notice him,negative
he was in that scene,negative
ed,negative
here hes asked to let it all hang out sporting a threeday stubble and oily bangs,negative
he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski but its somehow lacking,negative
modine lacks the feral intensity of brando entirely miscast in ferraras flesh fair,negative
better luck next time matt,negative
someday youll be forgiven for cutthroat island which wasnt really your fault in the first place,negative
maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere and all will once again be well in your world,negative
hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell,negative
the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films,negative
in a nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous,negative
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership a lot of hong kongs best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u s productions,negative
such talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yunfat anna the king the corrupter and yuen wooping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results,negative
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai,negative
unfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kongs rhythms,negative
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking,negative
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing russell wong,negative
kai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kais boss and leader of the local chinese family,negative
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down,negative
its not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends,negative
the following morning po sing is found dead,negative
suspicions escalate as issac oday delroy lindo is told of the murder,negative
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture,negative
issac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter,negative
the scene shifts to a prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder,negative
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined,negative
hung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work,negative
escaping to the u s han sets out to find the person responsible for his brothers death,negative
romeo must die is in many ways a fun film,negative
it is both absurd and assured,negative
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes the godfather,negative
the relationship between jet lis han and aaliyahs trish oday reminds us of abel ferreras china girl except that romeo must dies couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another,negative
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history,negative
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable,negative
li of course has the showiest part having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination,negative
allayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace,negative
its obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic,negative
but still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it,negative
delro lindo as issac oday carries himself well in the film,negative
an unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance,negative
the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d b woodside as issacs son colin,negative
the performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in,negative
an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written,negative
first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film,negative
having a career as one of the industrys best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots and romeo must die does look good,negative
but the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes,negative
the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in,negative
the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing,negative
and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayahs bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever,negative
the best things about the film are its fight scenes,negative
jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles,negative
one needs only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat,negative
here jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that lethal weapon 4 jets u s debut didnt allow,negative
unfortunately a lot of jets fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision,negative
also romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an xray effect that appears three times during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent,negative
obviously a homage to the famed xray scene from sonny chibas streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film,negative
its as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted,negative
one problem though about the fight scenes,negative
those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon,negative
they do have an internal rhythm to them,negative
a heartbeat so to speak in their choreography,negative
the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance,negative
this is created by the performance the direction and the editing,negative
here in romeo must die there is no staccato,negative
every fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern,negative
the rhythm is monotonous,negative
a hong kong film has a tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact,negative
rmd is limited to a standard 44 tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever,negative
a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chans films,negative
watch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help,negative
now look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx,negative
there you have a heartbeat and emotional draw that doesnt let the audience catch its breath,negative
the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted,negative
here in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl,negative
jet li is a grand and personable screen presence,negative
its a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here,negative
one day filmmakers here in the u s will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity,negative
until then well be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die,negative
snake eyes is the most aggravating kind of movie the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing,negative
its not just because this is a brian depalma film and since hes a great director and one whos films are always greeted with at least some fanfare,negative
and its not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance this film is hardly worth his talents,negative
its worse than that,negative
its aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of halfassedness,negative
or more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighthassedness,negative
in certain circles snake eyes was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawas classic rashomon where a crime is told from the four different and i mean different perspectives and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening which i might add is superb,negative
in one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife interupts a payperview event on tv chases down a gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talks with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise whos character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn whos also in this and watches as it happens,negative
theres a big name in the crowd and thats the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani whos sitting behind rick and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out,negative
this all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction,negative
what really happened this film asks and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene and,negative
discovers theres a very good possibility it was a conspiracy,negative
as we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in a panic and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened,negative
this is all going pretty fine and dandy and its extremely interesting to watch then,negative
it takes one wrong step,negative
we follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out,negative
but thats not the worst part of it its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it,negative
it only gets worse the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we cant rely on ricks investigation to be all that interesting,negative
its as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible,negative
events become more and more proposterous and by the end the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this the deux ex machina,negative
thats where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay,negative
this time its a hurricane an outofcontrol police car and a big round ball that adorned the arena,negative
what went wrong,negative
depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this,negative
depalma who idolizes hitchcock to death has done many a film like this such as his masterpiece blow out where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece,negative
but granted depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch what with his overthetop shot setups notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries,negative
at least his direction makes up partly for it,negative
then theres koepp who showed such great ability at making a characters flaws come to life like he did in depalmas earlier carlitos way a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well,negative
he can write a flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just a halfassed effort,negative
hes flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasnt so formulaic,negative
a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup,negative
he may as well have said the opposite of what he says it would have at least gone with what the character was like,negative
this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way,negative
as i was watching the first half hour i couldnt wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspectives hed be given and perhaps hed have to make a choice between whos he has to believe,negative
now theres a film,negative
unfortunately the film has two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap weve seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma,negative
the real blonde r a womans face an arm some pumpedup pectorals blond hair a mans sad face slender legs a random hand here and there,negative
as the opening credits of tom dicillos the real blonde unfold these scattered fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini briefclad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman his head concealing her unclothed breasts,negative
if only the rest of this formless aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently,negative
joe matthew modine is a actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas,negative
hes feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his livein love mary catherine keener who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender,negative
mary a makeup artist regularly works on model sahara bridgette wilson who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disneys the little mermaid,negative
the bottle blonde has a turbulent onagain offagain relationship with bob maxwell caulfield a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde which he finds in costar kelly daryl hannah,negative
as the film unspools a variety of other characters pass through fashion photographer blair marlo thomas marys shrink buck henry and selfdefense instructor denis leary joes casting agent kathleen turner and hardass boss christopher lloyd and a mystery woman elizabeth berkley who keeps on crossing joes path,negative
where exactly does all this go,negative
thats a question best posed to writerdirector dicillo who doesnt appear to have the slightest clue himself,negative
his meandering largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers turning into deadend narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative culdesac,negative
and another,negative
and another,negative
at one point bob frustrated with the soap scripts complains to the head writer jim fyfe that his and kellys characters keep on going in circles with no hint of development or growth,negative
that is most certainly the case here,negative
joe gets a job and ultimately botches things he and mary bicker they make up only to have the pattern repeat itself,negative
unhappy with his bottle blonde bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied,negative
if there is a point to all of this dicillo dances around it spending his time on apparent digressions that as it turns out arent digressions at all,negative
the real blonde is not without some amusements,negative
it does have the occasional funny line and situation leary henry lloyd steve buscemi and dave chappelle shine in their small roles keener is a likable refreshingly earthy lead berkleys appearance is mercifully brief she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a tenminute role and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket last year the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six monthsdue to lack of viewer interest,negative
but on the whole the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its titleit may be glossy on the surface but theres nothing going on inside,negative
opens february 27,negative
there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling hapless straight man from the hysterical naked gun films crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof hes committed himself to starring in since,negative
the wavering movie spoofs however are less forgivable,negative
to be fair wrongfully accused the sendup in question and nielsens third parody since the last gun isnt quite as excruciatingly humorless as his dracula dead and loving it or spy hard which is a mighty good thing,negative
nielsen is still in tiptop comedic form able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them and he needs one very soon,negative
wrongfully accused meshes together the premises of the fugitive and patriot games casting its always game star as ryan harrison get it a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress kelly le brock,negative
she however sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband michael york a crime actually committed by a onearmed onelegged oneeyed man aaron pearl,negative
harrison is arrested found guilty and sentenced to death but escapes from a prison bus of course and then is pursued by a determined u s marshal named fergus falls richard crenna unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones already smirky oscarwinning role,negative
theres also a mystery brunette melinda mcgraw and an assassination subplot involving the u n secretary general but like any of it matters,negative
wrongfully accused gets off to an assured start with an inconcert nielsen touted lord of the violin by barechested posters pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedoclad mosh in front of the stage,negative
nice touch,negative
most of the scenes that follow however never top the opener,negative
hysterical exceptions the mentos and baywatch goofs,negative
movie parodies are crammed in at an almostsubliminal rate but most are empty,negative
when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la anaconda or baseball players disappear into a field of dreams esque cornfield theres really nothing to laugh at,negative
other moments like an interlude in a fishing shop are so unfocused that youre not sure what youre supposed to be laughing at,negative
there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied sendups here so its possible that pat proft by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two guarantees something is sure to stick,negative
and what does stick sticks well particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hardboiled dialogue what those naked gun s which proft collaborated on did great these bits are so ontarget that they allow you to remember wrongfully accused as an almosthalfwaythere spoof instead of a lamebrained failure,negative
the movie might have been cursed to begin with opening fast on the heels of mafia from proft colleague jim abrahams and baseketball from proft colleague david zucker but its a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing wrongfully accused of being nielsens funniest,negative
mr bean a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting,negative
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during beans trip to la but if they didnt look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride,negative
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick,negative
either way look out america bean is coming,negative
well what can really be said about this movie there is very little discernible plot,negative
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy,negative
it achieves that goal rather admirably but because it is that the plot is just screaming for help,negative
the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed,negative
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes adlibbed as you went,negative
dont go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece,negative
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie even if you dont like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because somethings are just so stupid,negative
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims or so it seems,negative
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner,negative
well there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasnt the easiest i am sure,negative
i have to concede that mr atkinsons acting in this movie is well done,negative
although the role isnt too demanding the slapstick is,negative
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie,negative
now the rest of the actors in the movie bad acting and poor casting,negative
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better just seemed wrong for the movie,negative
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasnt what was trying to be achieved,negative
one thing that i must say simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results,negative
tv shows should do just that stay on tv it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers,negative
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively the best known of those would have to be star trek,negative
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved,negative
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly,negative
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless,negative
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie,negative
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie,negative
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one,negative
reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger scream 3 and arlington rd are the others each derivative in their own special way,negative
the guy cant seem to write believable dialogue sample from reindeer games rule 1 never put a car thief behind the wheel create multifaceted characters or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely,negative
his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight,negative
i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie was gonna go here f ck you jack ass take that twist decipher this mother f cker,negative
its almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie,negative
and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is,negative
auteur theory be damned its krugers style not the directors that winds up on screen,negative
kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut sometimes less is more,negative
and his numerous twists cant even claim to be originals arlington rds ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer games we get this ol gem character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldnt know pronouns used to protect the gender of the character grammar,negative
be damned,negative
how did you know that,negative
the stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along,negative
since twist endings are currently so in vogue and seeing as how krugers screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending i guess its no wonder why he works so frequently,negative
hes quickly becoming miramaxs mickey mouse the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects,negative
this is appropriate considering that miramax which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicles,negative
their companys current logo could be we ride the trends,negative
reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head,negative
although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick,negative
affleck is such a puppy dog that its impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyones bitch,negative
the role itself is so badly written the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it the twists so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent serious movie getting,negative
it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy whos played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance,negative
james frain is nick rudys cellmate a manslaughterer whos found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron,negative
ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though shes never seen one picture of him,negative
which works out fine since the character is killed in a nearriot and rudy who was to be paroled on the same day as nick takes his place which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda looks like rape and a surprise visit from ashleys brother gabriel gary sinise who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish cohorts,negative
he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley used to work as a guard in the indian casino,negative
though by the end the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything ive described might as well be irrelevant,negative
this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on several scenes in which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid oneliner,negative
included two 2 scenes of two 2 different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no less,negative
though its an action film the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on incredulous as the audience,negative
the flick was directed by john frankenheimer a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the alist following a string of flops and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up,negative
it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin one of those almost but not quite movies which followed the island of dr morneau,negative
you remember the one with marlon brando in mime makeup and a not so flattering moomoo and now this,negative
he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brainzapped mtv audience to pick apart,negative
problem is these action scenes nearly all failed escapes serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play,negative
character problems abound rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of which is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off,negative
the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear,negative
but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster,negative
charlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her to play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next,negative
she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this,negative
gary sinise has played this role frequently and here as in snake eyes he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he goes again than a threat,negative
these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience,negative
i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been,negative
mind you though i mean this in the worst possible way,negative
i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the screams,negative
as a result its even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures see nightmare on elm street because it thinks its about thirty times smarter than it is,negative
based on a teen book of the same name and disappointingly adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top,negative
the appropriate mood being set this is angsthorror for the 90s we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town,negative
from there we see the blond female protagonist helen shivers woodenly played by sarah michelle geller getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male hero barry cox woodenly played by ryan phillipe and matched brunette pair of protagonists julie james and ray bronson woodenly played by party of fives jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr respectively cheer her on,negative
after getting drunk at a party going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing and having some meaningful sex if you believe what the characters say the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night,negative
his face is mangled so they cant tell who it is and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world,negative
cut to one year later,negative
the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad,negative
main brunette female the bright one of the bunch has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college,negative
blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light and now works at the family store in town,negative
brunette male is a fisherman living off the land,negative
blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team,negative
then predictably their past comes back to haunt them,negative
it all begins with an irrational murder followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer bad acting by a good actress anne heche an improbable plot bad acting by the main bad actors some more killing concluding in a climactic scene mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie,negative
all the while the actors and actresses spout off bad lines and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation,negative
not that the movie was without pleasure,negative
count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun,negative
mostly though note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eyecatching pair look,negative
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride and its sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the years finest films,negative
so naturally when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found this notion left me puzzled,negative
it is a rare thing for a childrens movie to be praised this highly so wouldnt you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly magical piece of work,negative
a tad bewildered but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind having great expectations for the film,negative
looking back i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater,negative
believe me i wanted to like babe pig in the city,negative
the plot seemed interesting enough after the events that took place in the original babe the sheeppig has become a legitimate national phenomenon,negative
but after a fateful encounter with a water well arthur hogget james cromwell who the movie could have used alot more of has been rendered bedridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially,negative
the only solution that his wife magda szubanski going from delightfully charming to downright annoying can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair i think and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public,negative
problem is the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded city a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion,negative
setting the main plot in motion mrs hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels,negative
it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright,negative
here is where the film took a wrong turn,negative
up until this point i had being having a rather enjoyable experience,negative
the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs hogget is accused of smuggling drugs,negative
unfortunately the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel none of them being even onetenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe,negative
the main topic of discussion surrounding babe pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children and i believe it is,negative
at one point a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown,negative
at other times we are treated to surrealistic flashbacks to mrs hoggets full cavity search at the airport,negative
in fact the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing,negative
however that is as they say neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway,negative
the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half let alone entertain a child,negative
another problem i found with the film was its sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story,negative
if youre going to make a darker and more sinister sequel fine,negative
it may not be my cup of tea but at least it is a noble ambition,negative
but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs hogget swinging from walltowall of a ballroom in elastic overalls,negative
it just didnt feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining and the same goes for the rest of the movie,negative
as a hotshot defense attorney kevin lomax keanu reeves has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients,negative
he is also an excellent judge of character knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witnesss testimony,negative
and on top of that hes a damn good trial lawyer,negative
in the opening scene it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty but it doesnt hamper lomaxs desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt thereby getting an acquittal,negative
his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country headed by john milton al pacino,negative
he is brought to their headquarters in nyc where he immediately impresses milton and is subsequently offered a fulltime position as head of their newlycreated criminal law division,negative
lomax is soon given the case of his life,negative
he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide,negative
the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell,negative
he works late defends the guilty pledges his soul to his firm and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife mary ann charlize theron,negative
but what starts off as a promising john grishamlike story about consciencestricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story,negative
it begins like a typical parable where a smalltown boy makes it big but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money power and greed,negative
but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm,negative
quite literally he is the devil in disguise and as the movie progresses he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago,negative
freaky and frightening things begin to happen and after much of the film has elasped miltons horrifying intent is finally revealed,negative
the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts,negative
the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a bigcity trial lawyer,negative
the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax,negative
unfortunately the two never mix well into a cohesive story and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere,negative
granted the film is very handsomelooking,negative
youll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino,negative
youll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties,negative
youll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away,negative
this was one of the better storylines but unfortunately is only a subplot,negative
as with all things involving the devil you can expect nothing but the worst,negative
in the first few scenes reeves anchors the film but then slowly drifts into the background,negative
his path from selfvanity to selfconsciousness is never fully explored,negative
his actions seem arbitrary and his reasons for them not fully known,negative
pacinos comical portrayal is spirited but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie,negative
there is another plot or two that is introduced but never gets revisited,negative
the focus seemed inconsistent throughout and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap,negative
this movie tries to be horrifying thrilling and dramatic all at the same time,negative
however while the devils advocate strives to get noticed ultimately it makes very little impression at all,negative
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo the killer hard boiled face off appears to have made an exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american read unsophisticated hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them,negative
sadly as the picture progresses the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up twohour long episode of magyuver,negative
and not a particularly good one at that,negative
what went wrong,negative
mi2 begins flashily enough that initial flash leading us to believe that itll soon give way to something of a plot but it only gives way to more flash then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruises firing gun just so they can die really cool,negative
early on during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt tom cruise and nyah nordoffhall thandie newton woo works some of his trademark magic,negative
in one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence the director slows the action down to a languid semistall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and others eyes with come hither sexuality just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff,negative
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain sans scaffolding then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another,negative
why,negative
i havent the foggiest,negative
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply,negative
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects,negative
its possible that these spies could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off though of course this is never explored,negative
the scenes ive described are really only included to titillate not to give any insight into character,negative
god forbid,negative
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commerciallike visuals,negative
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy the opening has much to cherish,negative
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is,negative
between the frantic dancing woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact,negative
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way yet it has style and something of soul and woo casts a bit of a spell on us,negative
sure its all smoke and mirrors but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product,negative
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene thats about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight,negative
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres,negative
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously,negative
cruise grins a little too slyly,negative
the cruise character ethan hunt has been drastically altered since the first film,negative
here cruise plays him more as a hip sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1,negative
hes cool and dashing which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film and blustered his way through magnolia quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90s,negative
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruises initial im the man,negative
charm and more slomo closeups of his preening mug,negative
mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just wont stop,negative
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle the first gun fight in the film which really should be unheard of in a john woo film but alas this particular battle couldve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi of course excepting the symbolic pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture,negative
weve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand,negative
it isnt done any differently here,negative
the action is pure hard target broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind,negative
hes cool for sure but hes made to be as empty as the movie,negative
the actor isnt used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment be it during a gunfight before one or after one,negative
when hes not beaming away hes staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell but woos editing seriously undermines the effort,negative
he fetishizes cruises angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof,negative
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that hes really austin powers,negative
in a classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pinup boy angel of death,negative
the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does,negative
the lead bad guy played by the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken on motorcycles,negative
though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug only to fly about a hundred feet still in bear hug position land on a beach below and begin a manoemano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a so you thought i was dead,negative
not to worry cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat,negative
what a hero,negative
you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2s plot,negative
my reasoning is simple im not sure of any good it would do,negative
the film itself has absolutely no concern with story only with hurtling forth to the next special effect,negative
i wasnt kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video,negative
nobody will go to this for the plot and if they do theyll surely regret it,negative
as summer movies evolve or devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing,negative
in mi the plot seemed to be built around brian de palmas that films director stylistic flourishes while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woos nonstop masturbatory pandemonium,negative
its irrelevant in every sense as is character,negative
all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors,negative
the 13th warrior comes at the end of as summer where weve already experienced man eating sharks deep blue sea man eating crocodiles lake placid and even a man hunting witch the blair witch project,negative
now the 13th warrior presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears,negative
the story if thats what you want to call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas an arabian poet who falls in love with his kings wife and is banished from his home land,negative
he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them,negative
eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men,negative
thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission and as you guessed it ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth,negative
hes not a warrior and at first not well accepted by the vikings but as the movie advances hell have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield,negative
thats basically the entire plot,negative
there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and one assumes drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didnt just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story,negative
instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer,negative
the film is basically non stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock,negative
the battle scenes although well choreographed are not involving and not the least bit exciting,negative
we dont get to know any of the characters and so we dont care who lives and who dies,negative
the film which wants to be beowolf comes across more as a failed actionadventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels,negative
it was directed by john mctiernan whos the thomas crown affair is also playing in theaters currently,negative
and its not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that the 13th warrior was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences,negative
it belongs back on the shelf,negative
dr alan grant sam neill jurassic park is becoming disillusioned,negative
paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter,negative
his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up,negative
when the kirbys william h macy fargo tea leoni the family man ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna the notorious site b of the lost world hes disdainful but once they wave their checkbook he reconsiders,negative
however the kirbys havent given dr grant their real agenda in jurassic park iii,negative
of course we the audience have been tipped off given that the film begins by showing us eric trevor morgan the patriot a young boy and ben mark harelik election going for a paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry and looks like cheesy rear projection,negative
grants established back home with a new right hand man billy brennan alessandro nivola loves labours lost on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds,negative
he also pays a visit to old flame dr ellie sattler laura dern jurassic park now married to another with a young son who calls grant the dinosaur man apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the films poorly imagined finale,negative
grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip which is really an illegal gambit to save their son that young paraglider,negative
the couple arent millionaires making grants check bogus and theyre separated as well eric was with amandas new boyfriend not that that makes much sense meaning were in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining,negative
the kirbys hired hands and obvious bait are a threesome led by mr udesky michael jeter the gift,negative
didnt anyone consider that casting michael jeter and william h macy together and not having them be related was a little odd,negative
as directed by joe johnston october sky jumanji spielberg only produced this one from a risible script by peter buchman and the election team of alexander payne jim taylor jurassic park iii is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos a spinosauraus which goes head to head with the trex and pteranodons,negative
the plot as it were is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks,negative
the effects are no longer new and as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson rather murky looking at times,negative
film editing by robert dalva october sky was presumably done by machete to keep this down to a 90 minute run time,negative
i know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes,negative
original music by don davis just repeats john williams original themes,negative
while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional,negative
jurassic park iii will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect the same crowd who maybe liked the lost world jurassic park,negative
you know i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man,negative
while watching instinct i couldnt help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the wellexplored themes of those earlier movies,negative
even beside the tarzan comparison instinct just isnt a very good film,negative
its painfully idealistic manipulative and silly,negative
i didnt hate it its simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins furthermore most of the acting is quite good,negative
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved,negative
i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct and its pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams,negative
things start off in the predictable way as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero theo caulder cuba gooding jr an ambitious young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced old psychiatrist donald sutherland,negative
caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life the one he thinks will make him famous,negative
the subject is ethan powell hopkins an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years,negative
powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa and its now caulders job to find out of hes mentally competent enough to stand trial,negative
through a series of short sessions caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell,negative
even though it really is an old man version of tarzan much of this central idea is rather interesting,negative
as i said hopkins is captivating for every second hes on screen he has a way of convincing us that hes not acting that hes actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas,negative
the character himself isnt very interesting hes just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action,negative
gooding jr does strong work opposite hopkins playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual,negative
the screenplay written by gerald di pego and suggested by a novel by daniel quinn gives us no background information on caulder but that seems to be the point he has no time for friends because hes obsessed with his work,negative
nonetheless these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct,negative
unfortunately filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting,negative
turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instincts artistic failure for they work together to make the dumbest most clicheridden environment in which their characters are to live and they do so by means of brainless subplots,negative
first we have the prison warden subplot,negative
the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulders progress at any cost if this means taking caulder off the powell case then thats fine,negative
theres also the prison guard subplot,negative
the prison guard is played by john ashton the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision and hes instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion,negative
then theres the daughter subplot in which maura tierney playing the daughter must look very upset a lot of the time after all she is the daughter of a deranged man,negative
if some of this stuff sounds familiar thats because theyre all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films,negative
the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here,negative
the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoos nest had,negative
ashtons evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy browns in the shawshank redemption,negative
hopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs,negative
and then theres the whole tarzan thing which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film,negative
perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth,negative
the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one he thinks that humans are takers that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas,negative
i can sympathize with that but only when its in a compelling film,negative
this is the kind of stupid movie just like patch adams in which a big group of characters psychotic inmates in this case rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards,negative
what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas,negative
if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor we would have had a thirtyminute movie far superior to the twohour one that i watched today,negative
if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise then we would really have had something interesting a movie that doesnt rely on the strength of its actors,negative
synopsis cromagnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion,negative
reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggystyle ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate,negative
comments allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies,negative
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the scifi classic blade runner,negative
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title,negative
not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese,negative
its so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that its oddly fascinating,negative
the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out,negative
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel,negative
to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following,negative
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dogeared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the socalled dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother,negative
i have never read this book but i sure hope its 10 000 times better than its film adaptation,negative
if not then im at a complete loss to explain its popularity,negative
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene,negative
a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t,negative
tramps about in the woods,negative
with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audiences expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered,negative
what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up aylas mother a blonde with fur pants er,negative
leggings,negative
tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well,negative
as the earthquake slowly recedes,negative
a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming sixyearold manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven,negative
i wont detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point,negative
this movie is really stupid,negative
it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief,negative
also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cromagnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston,negative
the movie doesnt just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with a twobyfour,negative
a blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs,negative
shes of the new people theyre of the old people with the memories,negative
yep,negative
we get it,negative
we get it,negative
the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best makeup which surprises me,negative
the movie depends upon a lot of makeup obviously but much of it is unconvincing,negative
as stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time,negative
the rest of the characters have dark makeup of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt,negative
the facepainting thats occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind,negative
this movie also suffers from its new age trappings,negative
maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music,negative
add to this the films fauxmysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and a narrator who sounds like a psychic youd expect to hear on a 1900 number and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious,negative
the clan of the cave bear is rated r though its probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ive seen in quite a while,negative
it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity,negative
the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes,negative
the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear,negative
the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about,negative
although this may sound gratuitous im sure its so cheesy that it probably wont bother most people,negative
the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie,negative
however as i wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality,negative
typically when i think of bottomofthebarrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind,negative
the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though its so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two stars,negative
i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however im only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie,negative
i shudder to think that it could be otherwise,negative
the second serialkiller thriller of the month is just awful,negative
oh it starts deceptively okay with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work,negative
after a babysitter gets gutted in the suit ably spooky someonesinthehouse prologue parallel stories unfold the first involving a texas sheriff r lee emery a gruesome double murder and the arrival of a morose fbi agent dennis quaid on the eve of voting for the local lawmans reelection,negative
the second pairs a hitch hiker jared leto with a friendly former railroad worker danny glover,negative
theyre headed west toward the rockies and away from the murder scene,negative
which one is the killer,negative
well it doesnt really matter cause when time director jeb stuart die hard finally spills the beans you wont take his choice seriously anyway,negative
the whole thing goes south about an hour in with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldnt follow,negative
and through the whole thing theres quaid playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea gal,negative
i guess im glad that i didnt walk out theres some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr,negative
strangelove,negative
out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey a cold uninvolving confusing new thriller,negative
though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard author of out of sight as well as jackie brown get shorty and pulp fiction after you watch it you realize that its not nearly good enough,negative
in an aggressively nonlinear fashion the limey li mey noun an english gentleman tells the story of wilson terrence stamp a british excon just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery,negative
he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny,negative
he doesnt know much about the circumstances of her demise all he has is a name terry valentine,negative
valentine was jennys former boyfriend a wealthy and corrupt record executive,negative
hes played by peter fonda in his first major role since the terrific ulees gold in 1997,negative
seeking valentines reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson,negative
he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party,negative
he winds up breaking his cover eventually setting off valentines head of security and valentine himself who decides to run for it,negative
what a mess,negative
i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time pulp fiction which twisted time every which way was a masterpiece but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer,negative
the limey does exactly that,negative
the plot is permeated with flashbacks flashforwards and what can only be described as random timetravel without any evident purpose,negative
there is no method to this movies madness,negative
it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably,negative
the plot isnt particularly interesting in the first place traditional mildly hackneyed and not very involving,negative
this is a sort of brooding film our protagonist doesnt speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude,negative
i felt like the director wasnt very interested in the proceedings himself almost like he made this film for a paycheck,negative
ditto for the editing which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant,negative
sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal,negative
hes not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here,negative
peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor hes shy quiet but always effective,negative
hes adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression his feelings dont always show on his face by you can always tell what they are,negative
this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion,negative
why soderbergh couldnt just parrot down and tell a story i dont know but what he does do certainly doesnt work,negative
the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil even the action scenes dont work,negative
1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one act two act three storyline but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it,negative
shall we go back to basics,negative
stallone attempts to act in this cop drama,negative
the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal whos nephew played by michael rappaport is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths,negative
keital dosent really want to get involved in anything gets rid of rappaport and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on,negative
this film should be brilliant,negative
it sounds like a great plot the actors are first grade and the supporting cast is good aswell and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance,negative
however it cant hold up,negative
although the acting is fantastic even stallone isnt bad the directing and story is dull and long winded,negative
some scenes go on for too long with nothing really happening in them,negative
in fact the only scenes that do work are action scenes which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid,negative
in this film serious means dull,negative
the dialogue is warbling and basically just repeats the same points over and over no matter who is delivering them,negative
the plot which has potential is wasted again just being cliched after a while,negative
in fact the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro both delivering their usual good performances,negative
however stallone although not given much to say gives a good performance,negative
however its not all that bad,negative
as said above the action scenes are well done,negative
theres also a very good ending which uses the cinemas sound system well,negative
in fact the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997,negative
if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending,negative
cop land then turns out not to be a power house film but a rather dull and not every exciting film,negative
hugely disappointing and i cant really recommend it,negative
one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek the star of the wbs runaway hit dawsons creek,negative
following in the foot steps of mtvs two other live action films joes apartment 1996 and dead man on campus 1998 varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace,negative
set in west cannan texas the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john mox moxon van der beek,negative
we know hes smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook,negative
coach bud kilmer jon voight has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him,negative
the star quarterback lance harbor paul walker is a handsome blonde hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader darcy ali larter,negative
also on the team are an enormous guy ron lester with some health problems and the token africanamerican team member eliel swinton whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin,negative
when lance is seriously injured mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies,negative
his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend jules amy smart is threatened and theres a big game at the end,negative
guess who wins,negative
nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love,negative
theres a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow,negative
van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes,negative
also the role isnt very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character,negative
hes still a pseudointellectual whiny nice guy except here he also happens to be a jock,negative
voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out,negative
the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers dont fare much better,negative
on the positive side walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville 1998,negative
scott son of james caan has some lively moments as tweeder the teams wild man,negative
larter as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas gets to show off the films most interesting costumes including a very eyeopening whipped cream bikini,negative
its interesting to note that the film definitely earns its rrating with a lot of harsh language alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise,negative
all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawsons creek presumably the target audience for the picture,negative
director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger from nickelodeon films a sister company of mtv and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression,negative
the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it,negative
the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out,negative
theres an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul foo fighters green day and aaliyah but its not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film,negative
brian de palmas snake eyes stars nicolas cages evil twin who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother,negative
like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload,negative
de palma whose last great film the untouchables was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic,negative
in snake eyes he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast,negative
only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material,negative
the rest of the actors become caricatures in this bythenumbers thriller,negative
ryuichi sakamotos atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene,negative
heavy on the long violin notes its rhythm is punctuated by thunder,negative
the script by de palma and lost worlds david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise,negative
only the latter is achieved,negative
cage plays rick santoro a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money,negative
the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held,negative
with a flashy bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone rick is an obnoxious cop who doesnt know when to shut up,negative
spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog he screams such lines as i was made for the sewer baby,negative
actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole,negative
sinise plays kevin dunne a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy who has come to watch the fight,negative
but most people in the film are not who they seem to be and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess,negative
the plot which is told in endless flashbacks concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen that adjective is of course redundant in hollywood thrillers,negative
the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not,negative
although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie,negative
the movies outline has some promise but the movie itself is leaden,negative
the film takes itself all too seriously,negative
at best it is a 1940sstyle b movie,negative
a little humor would have helped the script some but a complete rewrite would have been better,negative
and although i hate to say it a different director would have been the biggest improvement,negative
snake eyes runs 1 39,negative
it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers,negative
when respecting a director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect,negative
woody allen has made a couple lessthan good films and hes my favorite,negative
even martin scorsese hasnt had a perfect track record,negative
kevin smith after a smashing debut with the classic clerks stooped as low to sellout and make the dreadful mallrats,negative
i mean so far the only director whos made several films none of which have been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all,negative
which were great,negative
now i adore quentin tarantino,negative
his first two films were classic films the second one being one of the greatest films of all time,negative
but 1995 just wasnt that good of a year for him,negative
he made way too many tv appearances,negative
he mispronounced jackie chans name on the mtv movie awards,negative
and he made this film,negative
he was also awarded an oscar so i guess that would be a grand exception,negative
robert rodriguez is also a great director not a brilliant one but a cool one,negative
ive never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film so i cant comment on them,negative
but in this crap ensemble directors film all four give pitiful efforts,negative
pitiful for any director too,negative
now in all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out,negative
ive never seen all of new york stories but have heard the first two films by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap i saw woodys one which was hilarious but not totally up to par but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film,negative
exposition a simple one a bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth whos a god and all but not in this one though he has a couple good moments is working on new years eve for his first shift in an old fancy hotel,negative
hes the only one there again and he only has a couple rooms yet again,negative
the old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily,negative
as the night goes on he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile,negative
yea,negative
the short films are presented in order btw,negative
the missing ingredient allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt,negative
this one starts it off horribly with no plot no intrigue and crap dialogue,negative
the situation is so terrible that its physically painful to watch,negative
the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is gasp,negative
stuck inside some object in their hotel room,negative
the witch that was supposed to bring it ione skye calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it,negative
yeah thats what i said,negative
stupid plot inane characters who arent interesting at all etc etc etc the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which in turn it wastes pitifully,negative
not even actually funny for a second,negative
my rating out of 5 no stars,negative
the wrong man alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender,negative
another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on,negative
ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex games,negative
ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon,negative
but at least this has a bit of comedy in it just not that much,negative
and david proval has never overacted as much,negative
and its pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window,negative
a masterpiece compared to the first one but still,negative
the misbehavers robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek,negative
would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayeks navel,negative
nope,negative
luckily shes on the tv dancing so we get to see her,negative
surprisingly enough when i read the screenplay about a year before actually seeing it this one seemed to have the most potential,negative
it was fastpaced funny and well funny,negative
but when i watched it it seemed anticlimactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once,negative
antonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny,negative
but as i said it moves slowly and in that way its more painful than funny,negative
but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time,negative
oh,negative
the plot antonio is a supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife tomita go out to get drunk at a new years party,negative
antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long but things go wrong it,negative
was okay,negative
the man from hollywood quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again,negative
ironically this one could be considered the best for a bad reason it best represents what quentin has done with this film,negative
he plays chester a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge boxoffice hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anticlimactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row,negative
theyre drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesnt light,negative
they also pay him a lot of cash,negative
this is so much exactly what this little film is about that its campy,negative
tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves cause theyve had hits major or minor,negative
it took quentin to realize that,negative
but the thing is it doesnt seem like he realizes that,negative
if he did id give this a good 3 stars,negative
but this sucked,negative
it was anticlimactic and the dialogue wasnt very good,negative
he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes,negative
that makes no sense,negative
its cool for a while then he makes it uneven,negative
its long and its just not very good,negative
hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one,negative
conclusion whats the moral here,negative
if youve made celebrated films dont do an ensemble piece,negative
they should have rewatched new york stories and then stopped in their tracks,negative
none of these have any point to them and theyre embarrassing to not only the but to the actors cause theyre working with crap,negative
but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentins next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which i found exhilerating,negative
i love quentin and i suppose its good he made the man from hollywood because it makes him seem more realistic and not some god of cinema,negative
i seem to respect directors if they arent gods and are actually human beings who make mistakes,negative
the man from hollywood is his big mistake and lets hope he doesnt return her continuously,negative
goodbye lover sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may and one look will tell you why,negative
its a mess,negative
and thats way before ellen degeneres shows up,negative
the film is one of those torrid doubleindemnity crime stories that in this case required the services of three screenwriters,negative
i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller one wrote a murder mystery and one wrote a comedy then director roland joff tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment,negative
i didnt laugh at ellen degeneres much i think i was supposed to,negative
degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse a toughtalking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair,negative
either degeneres is wearing a wigas most of the actors appear to beor she doesnt yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist,negative
every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip but her incessant wisecracking is poorlywritten and merely stupid,negative
her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is at least she died healthy,negative
and thats one of her wittier asides,negative
degeneres sgt,negative
rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of wait,negative
to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triplecrosses,negative
its best described this way,negative
sultry estate agent sandra dunmore patricia arquette is married to jake a creative yet unfocused and alcoholic advertising rep played by dermot mulroney,negative
sandra likes to act out her deepseated sexual fantasies and jakes brother ben the suaveasever don johnson likes to help,negative
ben is also coming on to his petite mousy coworker peggy blaine marylouise parker and someone somewhere is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his,negative
the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again,negative
although there are some genuine surprises the plot twists get too contrived too quickly,negative
probably around the time degeneres gumcracking gumshoe appears,negative
at least the former ellen star is going for something a little different,negative
arquette turns in yet another of her stilettoheeled platinum blonde bombshell roles see lost highway true romance while quoting embarrassing lines like im not wearing any underwear,negative
i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this,negative
heres an example of some of the films flatout stupidity,negative
sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the films duplicitous lovers,negative
she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite the sound of music on her car stereo intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims,negative
so what was the point of the wig and the car,negative
the sound of music stuff might be a reference to the wizard of oz allusions in david lynchs wild at heart but if so joff must have forgotten that wild at heart was a despicable movie,negative
its hard to believe that goodbye lover was directed by the same person who made the killing fields and the mission,negative
its not however hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long,negative
it should have stayed there,negative
since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993s steven spielberg drama schindlers list and directed 1993s intelligent searching for bobby fischer his new film a civil action should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career,negative
what doesnt make sense is how such highprofile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william h macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project which is both dull and completely ineffective,negative
the film which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia certainly contains the type of story to be emotionallycharged but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings leaving us with nothing more than a poorlydone courtroom drama,negative
based on a book by jonathan hart which was consequently based on a true account a civil action is set in 1982 in the town of woburn mass where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann john travolta decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their childrens death from leukemia due to unknown causes,negative
jan originally decides to drop the case but when he stumbles across to corporate giants grace and beatrice foods who have plants located near the families homes he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which thus goes into the citys drinking water,negative
suddenly after hearing about the families heartbreak and personal stories he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery even though he is warned by his staff accountant william h macy that no money is coming in to them only going out,negative
also figuring into the story is jerome facher robert duvall beatrice foods corporate counsel who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his 20million offer to settle the case,negative
coming from such a talented writer director and cast not to mention one of the most interesting film composers danny elfman a civil action is an astoundingly emptyheaded drama one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience,negative
perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning,negative
watching the film i couldnt help but notice its similarities with 1997s far far superior film the sweet hereafter which dealt with a lawyer played brilliantly by ian holm investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children,negative
in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident holm interviews the grieving parents as well as the sole surviving passenger a teenage girl which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter a young drugaddict who has run away from home,negative
not only was the plotting similar to a civil action but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes,negative
considering this it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful a sweet hereafter was not only concentrating on the school bus accident but delving deeply into ian holms character and his own personal demons as well as the teenage girl,negative
in a civil action however i have no idea where the running time went since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness,negative
we do not get to know the parents very well nor any of the main characters,negative
through its whole duration i did not learn one thingnot one thingabout travoltas lawyer character jan schlictmann who doesnt appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job,negative
every scene is tediously related directly to the premise and therefore there was no one for me to care about or root for,negative
youve got to work pretty hard actually to not get an audience to become involved in the parents plight since their children are dead but that is exactly what a civil action does,negative
to be honest i would be fairly hardpressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked,negative
aside from one flashback to when a mans young son died on the way to the doctor i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes and more than once found my mind wandering,negative
i could say the performances were good but whos fooling who,negative
since every character is onedimensionally written no ones acting abilities are challenged in any way,negative
travolta plays a lawyer well enough but thats about all he does,negative
duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role apparently only appearing to give oneliners at every chance he gets,negative
and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the pictures final scene as a judge,negative
she appears unbilled since it is just a cameo but why did she even agree to do it in the first place,negative
finally when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role the film left me with another question what was the point,negative
abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum where none came before that to begin with a civil action seemed to me at least to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with,negative
long time buddies and neil diamond tribute band members wayne steve zahn happy texas and j d jack black high fidelity watch in horror as third mate darren silverman jason biggs american pie disappears under the thumb of his new fiance judith amanda peet the whole nine yards a controlling psychiatrist,negative
theyre doubly troubled when the return of darrens one and only love sandy perkins amanda detmer final destination returns to their home town but doesnt cause a ripple in darrens devotion to judith,negative
theres only one thing wayne and j d can think of doing they kidnap judith and fake her death in saving silverman,negative
written by hank nelken and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman saving silverman is directed by hit comedy director dennis dugan of such films as big daddy brain donors and problem child,negative
its a dismal thirdrate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darrens love interest come from a family of circus freaks and be about to become a nun,negative
gross out gags include a visualization of darren getting butt cheek implants,negative
saving silverman is almost saved by stars zahn and black,negative
these two are so comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods,negative
theyre in animal house mode while the rest of the film trawls along and comes up empty,negative
jason biggs can attribute his entire career to the luck of having been cast in the smash hit american pie,negative
peet shows some physical moves but no flair for comedy here while detmer slaps a brave sweet smile onto her face and soldiers through,negative
r lee ermey full metal jacket is one note in an embarrassing performance as a psychopathic exfootball coach,negative
neil diamond appears at the films climax as himself and miraculously enlivens the proceedings by belting out some of his old standards,negative
the classic story the production which ruined it,negative
marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h g wells classic new line cinema armed with a stellar cast and expert makeup effects man stan winston alien predator terminator etc churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel,negative
of course the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 under the title the island of lost souls sounds like a much better title,negative
the story begins with edward douglas thewlis a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery kilmer after his plane crashes into the sea,negative
douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr moreau who incidently owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize,negative
his hosts reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreaus lab when a monstrous birth was in progress,negative
even worse the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal people,negative
douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beastpeople community which considers dr moreau their maker,negative
using shocktherapy and the law dr moreau has long been able to keep his beastpeople civilised to some extent but there are a few animalmen who are just too savage to be controlled,negative
the island of dr,negative
moreau questions the ability of men playing god,negative
dr moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long,negative
moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp,negative
even so the production has failed to make the most out of it,negative
there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is the characters are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather,negative
ungloriously at times too,negative
perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreaus creations,negative
the two very important characters montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably,negative
more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development,negative
i really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreaus obsession montgomerys purpose in the story and justification to as why the beastpeople had to rebel,negative
maybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently does not incorporate much action sequences in the film forced the filmmakers to cut a long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else its still summer and movies have to be marketable,negative
the special effects too are really nothing for anyone to shout about,negative
at most i would say the beastmen looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes,negative
this h g wells classic really has potential to be a good film,negative
unfortunately after 2 adaptations they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story,negative
as a third outing the island of dr moreau,negative
accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of the planet of the apes,negative
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that its a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring cliched individual not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldnt be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio which they did according to this film,negative
are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it,negative
54 belongs in the elite group of films known as the big disappointments the films that attain so much hype so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished,negative
i was heavily awaiting 54 not the least because ive become fascinated with the infamous club which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary thats been running all summer on vh1 which is weirdly enough much more intriguing and engrossing than this edgy film,negative
perhaps more importantly 54 is part of the blossoming subgenre the 70s nostalgia film which has been picking up mighty steam what with boogie nights and the last days of disco coming out within the year and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period but brought us interesting and real characters like scotty the tragically gay boom mike operator from boogie nights and charlotte the ironically clueless and bitchy coprotagonist from the last days of disco not to mention several others,negative
54 deals not so much with the timeline of the studio how it began how it was run how it ended thats all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale but more interested in the characters who populated it,negative
this is a definite plus,negative
heres a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases economy problems and perhaps worst of all reagan all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening,negative
the story of the studio is tragedy in itself lets look at how it all affected the people,negative
but this film doesnt let that happen,negative
it gives us a halfassed protagonist named shane oshea ryan phillippe from i know what you did last summer whos chief character trait is the fact that hes from new jersey which also happens to be his chief character flaw i guess,negative
hes dimwitted into being part of the scene and soon finds hes become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars a,negative
bit like saturday night fever cept no travolta and no real interest put into him,negative
poor poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting but all he is a halfassed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been,negative
shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club like anita salma hayek a wannabe donna sommers and her young hubby greg randanzo breckin meyer from clueless who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame,negative
although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster sela ward an exec of sorts he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black neve campbell and thus the boring romance subplot thats all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film,negative
the films sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the alltoo necesary personage of steve rubell played by mike myers you heard me,negative
rubell the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation but the film thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers makes him out to be more than that,negative
notice the scenes sole shocking scene where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene and a couple others that some of us whove only seen him on tv never saw and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails,negative
first time feature director mark christopher proves that hes a better director than a writer though not too terribly much,negative
his story is trite and shallow as are his characters and his direction is shockingly flat especially for a film about this subject,negative
its as if he had a great story to tell but instead opted for the easier route,negative
the studios recreation is amazingly accurate though and very impressive but his direction is never captivating enough,negative
some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in despite the films tone i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellinis la dolce vita and when i watched 54 i didnt particularly want to stay,negative
in the mid1980s following the splendid debut in hugh hudsons greystoke and relative success of first highlander film it looked like christopher lamberts acting career might go somewhere,negative
but it wasnt meant to be which became obvious following highlander ii,negative
in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality,negative
very often such films were science fiction which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert,negative
whether it was because of real lack of talent terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isnt important the end result was almost always horrible,negative
the same can be said for fortress 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond,negative
the movie is set in 2018,negative
for some undisclosed reason usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child,negative
jake christopher lambert and karen brennick lori laughlin broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border,negative
sentenced to 31 years in prison they are both thrown into fortress privately owned correctional facility equiped with stateoftheart futuristic technology and run by computer called zed,negative
although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible prison authorities often use violence,negative
jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape,negative
such escape should become necessity because the warden poe kurtwood smith begins showing unhealthy interest in karen,negative
after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity,negative
the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich s and situations that are painfully predictable,negative
by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress those situations not only begin to look predictable but utterly implausible too,negative
of course film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultraexpensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society,negative
the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters played by not too interested or talented actors,negative
lori laughlin although physically attractive shows the acting ability of sequoia,negative
kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired capable of solid yet forgettable performance,negative
lamberts performance is also good but even the bigger talent couldnt help this film destined to end in oblivion,negative
traffic violation dr daniels review of uturn,negative
dr ds rating critical condition,negative
okay heres the deal,negative
ill be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then,negative
ill even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well,negative
i mean hey ive been known to stretch a weekend into a threeday outing if friday looks to be a slow day,negative
and if monday aint looking like a pickmeup well ive been known to give martha nell a call and say do me a favor sweetheart,negative
bump old man fergusons boil lancing to tuesday morning and tell miss audrey that ill swing by her house monday evening and see if we cant get her trick knee back in line,negative
a simple sentence like that and ive got a nice fourday fishing trip with the boys or more often than not a trip up to cherokee n c for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery,negative
but the point is if you take a day off do something different,negative
if youve worked yourself silly for months relax a bit,negative
sleep in,negative
eat pancakes at noon,negative
microwave an egg in its shell,negative
watch pro wrestling with the sound off,negative
listen to some barry white records at high speed,negative
whatever,negative
but do not under any circumstances spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living,negative
and if you do dont make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time,negative
because i do not want to hear your sob stories oliver stone,negative
you apparently thought you needed a break from making important films,negative
cool,negative
so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie,negative
thats cool too,negative
but ollie old sage do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade,negative
im just eager to meet you one day so i can buy you a stoli look you in the eye and say what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with uturn,negative
and ill stand there staring til i get a straight answer,negative
sean penn stars uturn as bobby a drifter whos had some troubles a while back,negative
hes heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose stranding him in superior arizona held there by an ignorant inbred turtleneck hick of a mechanic named darrell,negative
while darrell puts a new hose on the ride bobby walks into town to see whats cooking,negative
is it needless of me to say that superior arizona is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely,negative
probably not,negative
bobby meets up with grace jennifer lopez who invites him back to her place for drapehanging and other domestic issues,negative
just as those issues are starting up graces husband jake storms in looking like checkout day of the elks lodge convention,negative
just beats bobby silly,negative
bobby takes to the road only to meet up with jake again and jake asks bobby to kill grace,negative
a little while later grace asks bobby to kill jake,negative
them murderous arizonians,negative
gotta love em,negative
if any of this sounds familiar congratulations,negative
you win a kewpie doll,negative
the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl maker of the phenomenal the last seduction,negative
but the contest doesnt end there guys and gals,negative
we get steals from russ meyer movies where everybody in town is horny and sweaty,negative
we get the town from bad day at black rock minus the train plus busty women who can speak,negative
look at any schwarzenegger film and youll see our hero bobby as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times gets bit by a tarantula gets shot at and ends up with vultures circling overhead all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick,negative
bobby as terminator,negative
stretch it a bit and we have a fivefinger discount from doc hollywood where the whole story occurs because of car trouble forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic,negative
okay hes working from a book so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas,negative
i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative,negative
i just wish he hadnt brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toestub,negative
sean penn gives a great performance and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be playing overthetop caricatures of stereotype characters,negative
the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blanketyblank is going on,negative
too bad its not fun to watch when its happening to us while,negative
we sit through this mess of a film,negative
uturn is not a bad film if youre a fan of technique,negative
its the oliver stone youve always known,negative
robert richardson is his usual cinematographer and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick great camera angles shifting viewpoints wicked colors nice looking pictures,negative
but pictures of what,negative
i think id rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tiltowhirl point of this loser film,negative
plot twists are one thing repetition is almost unforgivable and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ive seen in the past five years,negative
oliver i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at,negative
youve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie and films like platoon jfk wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on,negative
your scripts are certainly respectable your budgets are up there on the screen and your actors dont dog it,negative
and i know that maybe with uturn you were just kicking back just having fun,negative
thats fine,negative
but dont do that with a movie with the potential of this one,negative
do some police academy sequel imagine that,negative
do a big comedy like a remake of its a mad mad mad mad world,negative
but do not drop a limp uturn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as an oliver stone movie and not question why it stinks like weekold snook,negative
theres a right way to have fun and a wrong way to have fun,negative
this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail,negative
can you say dated,negative
you can if youve seen rosemarys baby which like the exorcist was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release,negative
mystery science theater 3000 has skewered the bad films of the past but let me tell you it could do a number on the good ones too,negative
rosemarys baby stars mia farrow from the time she was actually goodlooking as an innocent housewife and her notsoinnocent husband john cassavettes an actor who takes an easy albeit evil road to success,negative
it all seems so harmless in the beginning,negative
mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed,negative
theres also a skull in the living room but its only for decoration,negative
their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming,negative
alls well for about the first hour of this slowmoving film until mia eats some of the neighbors chocolate mousse and passes out,negative
when she comes to she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big evil man raping her a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen,negative
it seems like a dream and when she finds herself pregnant she almost forgets about it,negative
and everyones helping with the pregnancy,negative
the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink a goodluck charm for her to wear around her neck and the name of an obstetrician whos been in the business 66 6,negative
years,negative
meanwhile mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight,negative
before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries,negative
thats when you know your healths failing,negative
the only person in the movie whos the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend maurice evans who calls mia up to give her the bad news and immediately falls into a coma,negative
by about the twohour mark i felt the same way,negative
rosemarys baby is way too long and leads up to a payoff thats about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie,negative
i guess someone put a spell on this movie,negative
bythenumbers a film which introduces characters situations dilemmas and developments that weve seen before in a parade of other films,negative
a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one,negative
a film which is packed to the cap with predictability leading to very little tension excitement suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience,negative
in short a clich ridden formula film,negative
welcome to my review of the generals daughter,negative
plot an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughters rape torture and murder,negative
they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hushhushes to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder,negative
critique by the numbers see above,negative
this film is just there,negative
it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours floats around goes away hopefully never to be heard from again,negative
it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away,negative
its as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree,negative
its as actionpacked as a canadian curling tournament,negative
get the picture,negative
i sure did its,negative
too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot and to break down each scene before it was even completed,negative
easy as pie,negative
its unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film but alas twas not to be that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted,negative
woods chews it up in the few scenes that hes in travolta passes the test cromwell plays well cromwell and stowe is window dressing with a smile mia since 12 monkeys 810 it seems,negative
and this predictability isnt reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen,negative
its like riding a bike,negative
other scenarios which sponge out any tension suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually breaking down to the investigators without much reason given a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the best poor mans michael bay doing his best poor mans impression of tony scott add two scenes with sunlight shining through some halfopen shades for grit and integrity and an allout rainfall for the finale for further chaos and youre a great director,negative
yawn,negative
yeah whatever tony i,negative
mean simon,negative
and arent we all sick of hearing about these army bad boys and their overdone code of silence,negative
enough already,negative
next subject please,negative
see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman 8 510,negative
otherwise save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead,negative
youll feel much better afterwards,negative
trust me,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars ironically john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman which eventually went to little dickie gere,negative
ironically on james woods part he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tvs welcome back kotter starring none other than john travolta,negative
actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his big dick on howard sterns radio program,negative
unlike rocker tommy lee woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180,negative
he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section,negative
what a man,negative
john travolta is married to actress kelly preston and they have a son named jett travolta loves them planes,negative
word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis home,negative
director simon wests first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air 6 510,negative
before that he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants,negative
yippee,negative
veteran director john frankenheimer ronin 7 510,negative
the manchurian candidate portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film,negative
the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5 1968 it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day,negative
clarence williams iii who plays colonel fowler in this film is known to some from his role as linc in the original mod squad tv series,negative
younger folk may remember him as princes father in purple rain,negative
holy man boasts a sweet gentle comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits,negative
unfortunately to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long setup loads of tedious filler interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggias career,negative
if ever a movie screamed wait for video so you can fastforward through all the dull and annoying parts this is it,negative
eddie murphy plays g a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message,negative
a chance meeting with ricky hayman goldblum a stressedout executive of a homeshopping channel and kate newell kelly preston a nononsense media analyst results in physical injury to g quicker than you can say the odd couple g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky,negative
after some script gymnastics g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations enraging network owner mr mcbainbridge loggia and becoming a national media sensation,negative
holy man attempts to be several things at once,negative
it tries to satirize home shopping networks but its difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a selfparody,negative
the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts but thats common knowledge already,negative
holy man also tries to present a story of redemption as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit gs good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career,negative
anyone want to place a wager on his final decision,negative
the one genuine asset in holy man is eddie murphy who gives a charming performance sharing love good will and relevant advice to all those around him while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments,negative
murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever hes onscreen,negative
unfortunately hes not onscreen enough,negative
jeff goldblum gets the lions share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down,negative
as his potential love interest kelly preston tries to brighten things up but she transforms from an allbusiness media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance,negative
the other principal actor robert loggia wastes his talents in a onenote turn as a ruthless screaming monster,negative
structurally unsound and way too long holy man is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isnt,negative
instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle wait until it hits video and fastforward past everything except the murphy scenes,negative
g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and thats the best way to do so,negative
writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard,negative
harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun,negative
harder than building a bridge over troubled waters,negative
and incidentally a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review,negative
thrillers are all variations on a theme,negative
you have a smart resourceful and powerful bad guy who has a goal he has to meet,negative
you have a noble and brave good guy who has to protect the innocent kill the bad guy and not get killed himself in the process,negative
the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner,negative
this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest high noon or silence of the lambs or big summer blockbusters like men in black the fugitive or air force one or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds event horizon kull the conqueror,negative
is anyone else getting depressed here,negative
point is its not enough to follow the formula,negative
youve got to throw in something extra something good and new and better than the last version,negative
something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals,negative
this is a hard thing to do but it is absolutely necessary in every way,negative
without that something extra whether its a great plot or a wellwritten screenplay or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs the movie fails,negative
thats why the jackal with all its starpower with all its budget with all its hype gets a big fat f,negative
bruce willis is the bad guy the jackal a legendary killer for hire,negative
richard gere is the good guy a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal,negative
the jackal is trying to kill someone,negative
gere is trying to stop him,negative
will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal,negative
ill give you three guesses and the first two dont count,negative
there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal no moment when you say to yourself i wonder what happens next,negative
the script for the jackal isnt ripped straight from todays headlines,negative
its ripped off straight from an episode of millennium,negative
throughout the movie we learn what the jackals plans are and how he intends to accomplish them,negative
no surprise,negative
the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackals plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy,negative
instead we get two count em two scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackals plan just as if hes frank black or more likely just as if hes been handed a copy of the script,negative
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight,negative
its like geres character is psychic but neither he nor the fbi or the screenwriters seem to know it,negative
and just like in millennium the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about whether or not they are important to what hes trying to do or not,negative
whats more in the last half of the movie the jackal supposedly a supersmart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake comes down with a major case of the stupids,negative
as for the performances,negative
bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack which is a major achievement but not enough reason to see the movie,negative
his disguises are good but not as good or as interesting as val kilmers in the saint,negative
richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance,negative
sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie not that his performance is bad or anything its not but it is sad that hollywood wont use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent shoot to kill sneakers,negative
writing a good plot and a good screenplay like i said is hard but it can be done,negative
it wasnt done here,negative
it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones,negative
do not go see this movie,negative
youll only encourage the producers to make more just like it,negative
instead stay home and rent day of the jackal or in the line of fire or a fire safety video for crying out loud,negative
anything other than the jackal which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other better movies,negative
i should have known damn it i should have known,negative
ewan mcgregor codename eye is pointing a hightech riflely gadget at a fat bald businessoriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street,negative
we get the requisite electrogreen throughthesight view,negative
we the audience seeing a high tech riflely gadget of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target but instead he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy lowquality photographs which eye then proceeds to fax and email to everyone in his targets office,negative
all right so thirty seconds in i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless but i was still open minded,negative
maybe theres a really good reason for it,negative
ive got reason to believe you see i admire a lot of ewan mcgregors previous work,negative
and hes obi wan ke frigginnobi for gods sake,negative
and director stephan elliots last movie priscilla queen of the desert was a quirky little delight,negative
theres some genuine talent involved here,negative
i think at the twenty minute mark there was still a spark of hope in my heart,negative
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organizations son i still have no idea what this organization was british intelligence,negative
national spy ring,negative
private investigation who is apparently stealing from his trust fund,negative
he has received his assignment from k d,negative
lang through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase,negative
when eye tracks his target to an expensive looking secluded house he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ashley judd take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard,negative
ok thats odd i think to myself this could be interesting,negative
then she starts to cry and through her tears exclaims merry christmas dad,negative
for the first time,negative
so begins our tale of obsession,negative
or something,negative
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregors eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar,negative
throughout his entire professional life he has been a voyeur so when he falls for someone the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras,negative
fine thats a lovely premise i suppose,negative
but gosh darn it if youre going to go there you better have some sort of explanation,negative
and thats precisely where this film fails,negative
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off,negative
its an abortion a collection of halfformed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end,negative
it pretends it is something that it is not a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a hightech thriller,negative
here the filmmakers have confused surreal and deep with vaguely unclear and crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors,negative
i never even for an instant had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in love with this woman who changes wigs and kills people,negative
the movie offers only two explanations neither of which make a lick of sense,negative
explanation number one the obnoxious presence of eyes imaginary daughter who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago tells him he shouldnt leave ms judd,negative
explanation two which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie beauty is in the eye of the beholder,negative
whoo hoo that helps thanks a bunch case closed,negative
thats as deep as it gets folks,negative
there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes which instead of tying everything together ends up being as profound as a clever sixthgrade mad lib,negative
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was,negative
my personal favorites include the prisonmatron modeled after austin powers frau farbissina who apparently taught ms judd everything she knows about wearing wigs jason priestleys awfully played dirty desert vagrant 1 who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet but fails miserably and the copwhoseesashleyfleeinganaccidentsceneand thenwantstopayforsex butisshot,negative
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last,negative
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space,negative
any time one of the frequent location changes occurs the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe and minutes weeks or years could have passed,negative
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slowmotion closeup awash in a lot of bass,negative
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell,negative
jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks then laughs maniacally,negative
cut to random guy with eye patch,negative
iguana out of focus,negative
iguana comes into focus,negative
wow man,negative
when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel it came as no surprise to me,negative
there are plenty of elements here that if extended and fleshed out more would have made for a decent story,negative
and i wouldnt be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere or waiting in the wings for the dvd special directors cut,negative
not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing,negative
the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition,negative
some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone and this time i didnt particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking,negative
someone near cellphoneguy did eventually yell shut the hell up but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen,negative
an attempt at florida film noir palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels,negative
its slow moving uninvolving and plain just uninteresting,negative
harry barber woody harrelson is an exnewspaper man just out of jail after being framed for a crime,negative
his luck hasnt been the best but things are looking up when a mysterious woman rhea malroux elisabeth shue approaches him with a proposition,negative
she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get 500 000 out of her stingy but rich husband felix rolf hoppe,negative
at first all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone and to collect the money of which he gets to keep 10,negative
but as the deed is carried out things are not what they seem and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm,negative
palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film but the effect never quite comes together,negative
its got the sultry florida heat seductive women and even curvier plot twists but the whole thing smells of paintbynumbers,negative
sure the right ingredients are there but the end result is much too artificial,negative
a lot of the problems lie with the script which though providing some genuine surprises is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations,negative
even the plot twists dont seem to flow well with the rest of the story,negative
some of them for example come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist for example harrys spontaneous job offer or the whole typewriter situation,negative
the characters are mostly lifeless played to type but not much more,negative
woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thickheadedness that its hard to even picture him as an exjournalist,negative
elisabeth shue vamps it up but doesnt add anything special to the role,negative
chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance trying to be a sexy 17year old but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth,negative
some of the supporting cast notably gina gershon and michael rapaport give stronger but in the end meaningless performances,negative
and to top it off the pacing of the film is much too slow,negative
as the movie grinds to a halt youre given too much time to wonder why youre wasting it watching palmetto,negative
if youre in the mood for this type of movie youd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir,negative
talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters,negative
spice world is the feature film debut of the prefabricated pop band the spice girls,negative
its intended as a sort of hard days night but ends up simply hard to watch,negative
when watching the spice girls im reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name,negative
the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles and about as talented,negative
theres ginger geri halliwell the brainy one sporty melanie chisholm the athletic one baby emma bunton the childish one posh victoria adams the fashionconscious one and scary melanie brown the one with a tongue pierced back so far youre almost certain the post sticks out her throat,negative
the film itself doesnt really have a plot,negative
it follows the girls as they travel here and there culminating at their first live performance at albert hall,negative
the action however seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas,negative
the various misfires include an alien encounter a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls the shooting of a spice girls documentary a movie producer george wendt trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie nearly all of which though incredibly far fetched seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up a meeting with a pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends a boating adventure a bus race clubhopping wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd even,negative
when they start to sing and an assorted number of musical performances press conferences and general allaround celebrity stuff,negative
whew,negative
for some reason the film is littered with star cameos,negative
from elton john to elvis costello from bob hoskins to meat loaf,negative
heck even roger moore shows up though he cant decide if hes parodying himself as james bond or if hes lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld,negative
richard e grant has the largest secondary part a thankless role of the bands manager clifford,negative
the celebrity spotting is partially amusing and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film,negative
neither amusing or spontaneous when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring,negative
their songs are alright but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos,negative
my advice to fans is stay home and watch that video collection or at least spin that cd a couple of more times either,negative
option will be more enjoyable than the film,negative
nonfans should know to stay well away from this one,negative
writers dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer,negative
starring jamie lee curtis william baldwin donald sutherland joanna pacula sherman augustus marshall bell cliff curtis julio oscar mechoso,negative
i suppose im not extremely surprised that virus comes to us from a deciple of james cameron john bruno and if i strain real hard i could even say that its an obvious given particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr camerons early works,negative
in fact virus is yet another in the long line of paranoia thrillers from the aliens vein a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortallythreatening entity is out to get them a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies and maybe even to the first pictures albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future,negative
no such thing will happen to bruno whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasilandmark feature while bruno may have studied under camerons wing for years and years im beginning to wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him,negative
in fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron a director who if anything just knows how to make a movie and then make a film like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this zgrade schlockfest of a film albeit a zgrade schlockfest with a respectable budget,negative
the film seems to not only borrow its plot from last years similarlyfated deep rising but also from a clunkish bmovie from the 80s called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part alien part john carpenters twisted remake of the thing,negative
virus again has a similar uh selling point a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water,negative
they get on,negative
they break up into pairs and investigate,negative
and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy has taken over all the machines on board have meshed the machines with parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ha ha,negative
not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving not only does this film start off with a chintzy bondian opening the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters,negative
of its motley crew it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper a masculine potentialromanticinterest a drunken captain a black technician a tatooed aborigine a manic russian survivor and a couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin plain piece of writing paper,negative
and its not the traditional argument for films like these where you may in fact want them all to be eaten even aliens played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers but this was more of a plusside for the film as a whole than the opposite instead as another cliche goes you just dont give a damn,negative
i almost dont even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from subpar to horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pains me to say this as hes a particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performanceofwhichheshouldbeashamed,negative
like anthony hopkins for legends of the fall the line scrooooooo em has been thus embroidered upon my membrance,negative
or peter otoole in caligula,negative
great actor horrific performance,negative
it happens every now and then and it only helps sutherlands career that no one except for an elite few even bothered to see this film,negative
though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can read early january when everyones still trying to catch up on the potential oscarnominees it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film its laden with complex machinery boasts respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effects if of course i or anyone else could see them,negative
virus mostly takes place on a large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of lights not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because as the hollywood cliche seems to go if its dark enough then the special effects will be more believable,negative
and if you dont believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if theres even one shot where we see godzilla either a in his entirety in one wide shot or b n the light so that we can at least see him well you dont really have to sit through it again just take my word for it,negative
but all of this doesnt matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of a movie,negative
the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie ive ever seen my um favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves rain and any other oceanextremeties the film can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned well i must say thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldnt figure it out when i saw it,negative
imagine the first attack of the aliens in aliens shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity and thats basically the whole of virus one horriblydirected action scene after the other capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members,negative
and my god its a long damn sit,negative
with no interesting characters no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals its a wonder that it even got made,negative
we already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best and movies like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movies like virus manage to drain a little more out of the pool,negative
i almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light,negative
they read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead with the project only to have bruno and company shit back in their face,negative
even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie id say even more contempt should be aimed at mr bruno for making a movie that could be this bad,negative
in fact shouts of egad man what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway,negative
are not only justifiable but encouraged,negative
janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker,negative
this is a bythebooks movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs,negative
it also jumps on the everpopular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too,negative
garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator jay o sanders running for reelection,negative
denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent thats made the kennedy family so popular,negative
so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit,negative
she soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this,negative
the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland almost misses the bus to town cant get a hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has a dog piss on her luggage and so on,negative
then comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute,negative
it happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way,negative
in the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean david ohara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side,negative
no points for guessing its the same dog that just made water on her luggage,negative
also no points for guessing garofalo hates ohara on sight,negative
thats how it works in movies like these,negative
i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that shed hate him for awhile then succumb to his charms live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which theyd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits,negative
i havent mentioned the movies twist yet,negative
garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss,negative
milo oshea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together,negative
rest assured hell do all he can to match up garofalo and ohara,negative
oh and in keeping with the matchmakers utter predictability he dies toward the end,negative
what the message here,negative
sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with a weak script,negative
i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together,negative
leary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole,negative
he even undoes himself with the old microphones still on after hes done giving the speech cliche,negative
both of them should have known better,negative
die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior to the original in every respect,negative
place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the films pathetic screenplay,negative
every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor,negative
the plot is altogether implausible the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land,negative
the film has zero credibility and all of the characters come off as cliched cardboard cutouts,negative
so much for the script,negative
how about the action,negative
well lets put it this way director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan who directed the original as well as the hunt for red october and predatorall standouts for their hairraising suspense,negative
by contrast harlin doesnt have a clue when it comes to choreographing action and consequently die hard 2 never picks up steam,negative
die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute,negative
in fact the movie often seems deliberately campy and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad its good,negative
you do laugh but you laugh at the film not with it,negative
die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff,negative
the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie if you dont count neil simons biloxi blues,negative
year after year more predictably cliched military movies come out most recently sgt,negative
bilko and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last,negative
i thought stripes would be different,negative
with ivan reitman as director bill murray as star and harold ramis as costar and coscreenwriter it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army,negative
instead it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army,negative
murray about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him,negative
so he does and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell headshaving and sequences more mindnumbingly stale here than ever,negative
the characters are even less original ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette,negative
all the big name stars in stripes and even larroquette fall victim to the lame rehashed material and are never really likeable murray in particular,negative
he only gets a few decent lines in although those barelyfunny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters,negative
he was even better in caddyshack for crying out loud,negative
as with a lot of the late 70s early 80s comedies stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex obsessed no child should be able to watch it,negative
im sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over 400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition dear god,negative
every few seconds,negative
stripes isnt the playful kind of sex comedy either,negative
most of the time it seems downright misogynistic as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the womens showers or murray lifts a female m p,negative
onto the stove and with an iknowwhatyoulike look on his face says hes going to give her the aunt jemima treatment which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly,negative
you dont want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region,negative
im not enjoying this the woman protests,negative
my sentiments exactly,negative
synopsis original jurassic park survivor alan grant neill is tricked by paul and amanda kirby macy and leoni into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur to rescue their stranded son,negative
grants team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought,negative
review there is one reason why jurassic park iii is better than its immediate predecessor the lost world jurassic park,negative
the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life the former only 94,negative
the first park was a marvellous film full of aweinspiring sights interesting characters and genuine thrills,negative
its two successors have been pale imitations amounting to hundredmilliondollar bgrade horror movies,negative
at least this third entry realises it whereas the lost world tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot jurassic park iii simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin,negative
there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie the computeranimated dinos are no longer novel or exciting and even the firsttime presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation,negative
remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie,negative
nothing in this rehash even comes close,negative
add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman payne and taylor and phonedin performances by the normally capable macy and leoni and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts,negative
at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character and there is much less gore than in the lost world making this installment more suitable for children,negative
im not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick because im not sure just what the hell pardon the expression was going on in it,negative
however i can express the most important observation i made of it i e,negative
i didnt like it,negative
if i had to summarize this film i think id conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal,negative
thats the kernel of it anyway,negative
tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women feminism the role of the devil modern reformers and friendship,negative
unfortunately little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts theyre simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace,negative
actually i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was,negative
they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy on the level of ghostbusters and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones,negative
they laughed or tried to laugh at moments that were either barely funny or much more horrible than funny as if that could bend the film away from its rather frightening direction,negative
three women cher susan sarandon and michelle pfieffer live in eastwick a small midwestern town,negative
one night while drinking late into the evening they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives,negative
in seeming answer to their idle daydreams a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be,negative
he soon shows evidence of mysticalperhaps demonicpower and his devotion to the womens merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones,negative
even worse when ignored his moods become ugly and he mistreats the women for spurning him,negative
anyway the problems all three female characters are fairly uninteresting and several are cardboard stereotypes especially sarandons character,negative
we never get inside them never feel sympathetic to them because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland,negative
as for nicholson well even the devil needs a direction to go in and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie due to the grace of the screenwriter and more importantly nicholsons acting he still cant be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague,negative
and then theres the special effects,negative
not in themselvesthey werent that goodbut their overuse,negative
i was almost positive until i saw the credits that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl because of the big name actors in dopy stunts or stephen spielberg after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholsonblowndownthestreet stunt,negative
nope its another bunch of guys and directed by george miller who has shown great skill with effects before the road warrior nightmare at 20 00 feet episode of twilight zone the movie but apparently doesnt know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act,negative
fgawds sake guys this is jack nicholson,negative
let him loose,negative
let him grin demonically,negative
skip the splitting earth and fake lightning,negative
watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll all i could think of was what a waste,negative
if youre going to use slapstick like that use it up on pee wee herman,negative
nicholson does what he can with the role and when he can find his bearings can be extremely good the scene in the church for instance but most of the time he seems a bit stiff as if hes not sure what he should be doing next,negative
and no wonder,negative
this script goes all over the map giving you the feeling that itd just love to be allegory but its not sure about what maybe if you give it time itll think of something,negative
so what is the witches of eastwick,negative
a horror movie,negative
a folk tale,negative
a comedy,negative
a statement about women,negative
an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality,negative
i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me watching,negative
someone regurgitate halfdigested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms people the screen and ultimately the audience,negative
in other words a mess,negative
2 00,negative
if you like nicholson enough to watch him here maybe 25 of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others,negative
ugh that about sums this movie up,negative
just ugh,negative
the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic and when reviewing the previous films each film had a certain degree of intelligence,negative
and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following in spite of bad special effects horrible dubbing and a man in a lizard suit they maintained a certain degree of how to put this,negative
dignity,negative
not quite the word im looking for,negative
you understand right,negative
and in 50 years godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever,negative
leave it to america to screw the whole thing up,negative
from the geniuses that brought us independece day arguably the worst scifi movie of all time to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had,negative
while they do bring us eyepopping special effects that will amaze you they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies a storyline,negative
summing up the movie is simple,negative
heck i can do it in one sentence giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it,negative
simple as that,negative
matthew broderick stumbles over his lines and its hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dogwalking character on the television show mad about you,negative
the dialogue seems to be improvized almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all,negative
i can see the scene on the set right now,negative
all right,negative
we spent all of this money making big special effects and weve gotta get this movie out by summer or its going to bomb in our faces,negative
so you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head all right,negative
make up something mkay,negative
good,negative
roll film,negative
the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing and some of the cinemtography is welldone the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind,negative
still an hour into it you will become antsy wondering how long they can drag it out,negative
and drag it out they do,negative
i have to laugh,negative
the slogan for the film is size does matter,negative
i think they cut this too short,negative
it should read size does matter,negative
acting does not,negative
this review contains spoilers but believe me i dont say anything you cant guess 10 minutes into the movie,negative
i did go into this one with high expectations,negative
i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks,negative
i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining,negative
i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film,negative
boy was i wrong,negative
another garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has a story,negative
the story you ask,negative
well a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk,negative
he takes it home somehow getting it past customs and starts fiddling with it in his attic,negative
lo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but with meat hooks,negative
when theyre finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling,negative
they botch up their cleanup job however and manage to leave his heart or some gland i didnt really recognize the organ under a floorboard,negative
the guys brother and his brothers wife appear at the door soon after and decide to move in,negative
they throw away scumballs belongings and set up house,negative
turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage,negative
she starts having some wild hallucinations,negative
later hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slowmo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the groundall from the tiny cut on his hand,negative
said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumballs organ,negative
the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing,negative
it establishes mind contact with wife who agrees to help him get more blood because she really wants to be screwed again,negative
so she helps him kill three businessmen,negative
scumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back,negative
problem is he doesnt have any skin and even after three or four corpses still doesnt get any skin,negative
he finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother,negative
guess they couldnt get the original actor back,negative
who knows,negative
scumball whose name is frank is not a nice guy,negative
he describes his torture by the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two,negative
somehow i dont see getting torn apart by 90 fish and meathooks a lot of fun,negative
this guy is so bad how bad is he,negative
so bad that the rats cower in a corner in fear,negative
for good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves a third while the nymphos horsing around with hubby,negative
anyway hubbys daughter who if course is not wifes daughter starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams,negative
the dumb bimbo meets scumball and is not impressed,negative
she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle and brings out the demons,negative
at any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup theyre normally quite meticulous about that type of thing,negative
the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake,negative
the demons are not however the good guys,negative
the dumb bimbos the good guy,negative
she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank but also banishes them to hell or oblivion were not too sure which,negative
not too shabby for someone with singledigit iq,negative
this is basically a bad jinn story,negative
it is an awful movie,negative
awful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks which is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is,negative
continuity,negative
who cares,negative
acting,negative
terrible,negative
script,negative
horrible,negative
sounds canned,negative
unrealistic,negative
story is soso but the impact is lost long long before the film ends,negative
i do think the rat acting was quite good,negative
i have never seen rats look afraid,negative
they should get nominated for an award,negative
really good acting there the best in the movie,negative
the envelope for best furry rodent please,negative
a rating would be far too generous,negative
a 110 rating or 4 in the 4 to 4 rating system is far more accurate,negative
this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog,negative
i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show,negative
people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen,negative
had to have something to do,negative
dumb dumb dumb movie,negative
i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it,negative
it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself,negative
lots of slime and reddyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion,negative
the most interesting part of cant hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate to,negative
that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the films sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored,negative
the film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost,negative
too nicely,negative
for some members of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of whats going on with them watching this film,negative
we sit there wondering why weve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place,negative
i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this,negative
after all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with,negative
everyones here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and xphiles the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial lame and basically as a bunch of losers,negative
except for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there,negative
unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film,negative
the film as i said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything,negative
however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes,negative
we follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared identified with them,negative
and if we did we certainly dont want to revisit that state of being,negative
heres a quick lowdown its graduation and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche,negative
the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party,negative
cant hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the imwhiningbecauseicantgetagirliwant brand,negative
we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer whos been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart,negative
now that shes broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note hes written declaring his love for her in the hopes hell build up the guts to give it to her even,negative
though hes leaving for a multiweek intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson,negative
since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldnt be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because its a party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike whos humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom dont ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile,negative
ugh,negative
the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes films of the 80s most notably sixteen candles,negative
the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion,negative
this film forgets to satirize its characters and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and,negative
then says that its all okay,negative
we cant take this film seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it,negative
but i will tell you some things i did like i liked the direction except for a couple toooverthetop features like waytooglossy jump cuts its like an oxymoron and other obscurities,negative
generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altmanesque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable,negative
i actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost,negative
and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film,negative
however the character of denise really doesnt work with the film when really thought about,negative
shes far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone,negative
shes not just the cynic or the intellectual shes just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters,negative
she may ruin the film more but at least when shes on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least well be entertained,negative
a couple other things that just dont work mikes character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesnt work at all jenna eflmans uncredited cameo as an angel just didnt work but nice try,negative
basically the worst thing about this film the real reason im giving this such a low rating is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything wed do,negative
we dont feel for these characters because for most of us we arent stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots,negative
the acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what its portraying,negative
the answer for this film is no,negative
nice try though,negative
deserves recognition for making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20,negative
capsule review this is what feelgood family entertainment has morphed into in the 90s an hourandahalf commercial disguised as an unnecessary remake in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass,negative
between this rocketman and george of the jungle disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film,negative
as the absentminded professor who invents the titular computergenerated goop a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly,negative
the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newlyfounded but firm belief that john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments hes used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series,negative
take your kids to see boogie nights instead,negative
gregg arakis the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made,negative
so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus,negative
first of all some of the reviews were fairly positive,negative
also the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure was promising,negative
last of all i wanted to give arraki one more chance,negative
i mean the guy cant be that untalented can he,negative
the answer to that question is three letters long,negative
nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles,negative
since arraki doesnt know how to make anything coherent its hard to describe the plot,negative
lets just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend wont make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls,negative
the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star,negative
he turns out to be a nice guy who doesnt care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans,negative
this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming,negative
it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez,negative
i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft,negative
he works better with the camera this time around especially in the early scenes,negative
halfway through the film i didnt necessarily find myself enjoying the film but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation,negative
then as the movie went on arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads twisted sex games and alien abductions,negative
its sad because he almost actually had some decent material here but he ruined it with his usual in your face im such a renegade maverick filmmaker look what i can do attitude,negative
the performances are generally better than in the doom generation which isnt saying much,negative
at least we dont have to suffer jonathan i am the most hideous man in america schaech,negative
we are however treated to another round of james im more wooden than keanu duval,negative
sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film and kathleen robertson formerly of 90210 and now arrakis wife and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess,negative
of the tv star cameos john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist,negative
if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture,negative
maybe greg arraki doesnt want you to like his characters,negative
maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them,negative
maybe he just wanted to piss me off,negative
if so he was successful,negative
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast who would have guessed that the most savage maddog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by,negative
ben kingsley,negative
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark henry fonda in once upon a time in the west or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it,negative
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild sympathetic or even ineffectual character roles,negative
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious,negative
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast,negative
gary gal dove played by ray winstone has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain,negative
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing,negative
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a onetwopunch,negative
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa,negative
the second punch comes from gals past,negative
back in london gang boss teddy bass ian mcshane tvs lovejoy is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal,negative
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ben kingsley to fetch gal,negative
don will accept any decision gal makes from yes to certainly,negative
however if gal says no don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guys exporn star wife deedee amanda redman,negative
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybodys skin,negative
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness,negative
there are some serious problems in louis melliss and david scintos script that should have been caught before filming,negative
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success,negative
beyond an ability to use skindiving gear no special talents are required of him,negative
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for,negative
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault flooding the vault,negative
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool,negative
in spite of the provocative title the story is cliched and overly familiar,negative
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade,negative
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw a robert taylor type who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability,negative
the old gang however wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git im,negative
it is not a great plot,negative
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards,negative
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film,negative
it is an old plot dressed up to look new,negative
if the plot is old at least the style is creative,negative
this is director jonathan glazers first film but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout,negative
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences,negative
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes,negative
we see one side of a persons faces,negative
but the other side fades into the darkness a sort of metaphor for the halfworld these characters inhabit,negative
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden,negative
us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog,negative
at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking the heavy accents and the cockney language,negative
sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre the london crime film,negative
the plot may be new to british crime films but it would be overly familiar as a western,negative
further respectability comes from ben kingsleys highpowered performance,negative
i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kongrecipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter,negative
these kinds of movies are marked by an eyeopening sequence that introduces us to the main characters a lifeanddeath plot in which these characters become involved the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ridiculous subplots and sunglasswearing henchmen,negative
that is not to say that i dont like hong kong influenced movies however it is quite obvious that these moviemakers havent a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hiphoptalking thugs and stupid sight gags,negative
observe the opening sequence,negative
a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment led by melvin mark wahlberg and cisco lou diamond phillips,negative
they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles,negative
however their partner is unsure of which cable to cut,negative
he is undecided,negative
this happens for about 10 seconds,negative
the audience finds some humor in his foolishness,negative
the lights suddenly go out,negative
cisco is surprised and says whoa lets,negative
go,negative
and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence,negative
the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film,negative
needing cash cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter china chow of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi,negative
however the daughter is also the goddaughter of paris avery brooks who is ciscos and melvins boss,negative
infuriated and insufferable paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping,negative
during his investigation cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader and paris orders his capture and execution,negative
melvin must now find a way to stay alive,negative
by the way do you know how the investigation takes place,negative
ciscos partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing,negative
but mr nishi has a trace buster buster,negative
to counter that ciscos partner has a trace buster buster buster,negative
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster,negative
and so on,negative
there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live,negative
and there are lots of issues that wed like to know more about,negative
how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee,negative
what goes on among this clique,negative
why is cisco at odds with melvin,negative
there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction and instead we are given a notsoengrossing plot filled with oneliners silly sight gags extraneous subplots and tomfoolery,negative
and i havent even mentioned his financees visiting parents who want them to separate nor melvins mistress nor the pimplefaced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on,negative
if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences then shoot me now,negative
if snake eyes were a dog youd put it to sleep,negative
if it was a couch youd put it out on the sidewalk where it would sit for a week,negative
if it were your child youd be reading military school catalogs,negative
if it were a ship no it wouldnt be the titanic that would imply glamor and tragedy it would be the exxon valdez,negative
personal side note i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip,negative
for whatever reason my hotels cable system wasnt showing the astrosbraves game which featured a randy johnsongreg maddux matchup,negative
this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free so the invective deserved as it is should be seen in that perspective,negative
snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater,negative
snake eyes is not a good mystery movie but i had some questions wheres the manager and how do i get a readmit pass,negative
if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rentacar can i sue brian de palma,negative
is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cages oscar,negative
will someone please im begging you give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents,negative
and how exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does,negative
the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer,negative
if youve seen the trailer without seeing the movie consider yourself fortunate,negative
the trailer is a work of sheer genius,negative
it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie the noteworthy steadicam work the exuberance of cages performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman the essential elements of the marginal plot,negative
the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross,negative
is a best trailer category at the oscars that farfetched after all,negative
but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie,negative
the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot detective ricky santoro cage must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city payperview boxing match,negative
unfortunately there are multiple problems afoot,negative
the trailer gives away much too much of the story,negative
the shooter is killed instantly so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy,negative
the films secret is hohum at best and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is,negative
without an interesting plot without interesting dialogue and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level,negative
as much as i hated this movie i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit,negative
de palma is maddeningly inconsistent,negative
he can on his day create amazingly welldone movies the untouchables carlitos way,negative
on offdays he can be well just horrid the bonfire of the vanities raising cain,negative
snake eyes falls into the horrid category but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their filmschool degreeofdifficulty value,negative
the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor,negative
there is a splitscreen chase scene that looks pretty good and its followed by a gods eye view of a bank of hotel rooms thats imaginitively done,negative
this is whats called giving the devil his due,negative
but the technical skill doesnt even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie,negative
placing plot holes to one side for a moment snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps and perhaps the worst most overly drawn out ending in years,negative
snake eyes is a criminal act an evil waste of time and talent,negative
cage sinise and yes even de palma deserve better,negative
the audience deserves better but no refund no readmit pass no free popcorn coupon can ever restore to us the time weve spent or wash the awful images from our mind,negative
however we are left with one consolation that we were warned by the movies title because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps,negative
i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy,negative
boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment,negative
after an hour of the movie i was ready to change roomsinto another theater,negative
read on to see what i have to say,negative
four rooms,negative
starring tim roth jennifer beals antonio banderas quentin tarantino valeria golino madonna bruce willis marisa tomei alicia witt lili taylor and ione skye,negative
possible stars,negative
four rooms was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year,negative
key word here supposed,negative
four of the biggest directors in hollywood quentin tarantino robert rodriguez alexander rockwell and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast,negative
i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great,negative
the plot its new years eve and its a bellboys first day on the job,negative
he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems,negative
tarantino told his directors this plot and each of them wrote a script,negative
it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy,negative
anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches madonna valeria golino alicia witt and ione skye which was the worst one out of all of them,negative
the second room jennifer beals was better but lacking in plot,negative
this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife,negative
the third room antonio banderas was the best roomm about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite,negative
the final one tarantino willis was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someones finger,negative
the movie was just plain trash,negative
there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film,negative
it was not funny and i didnt hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film,negative
tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy and he ruins every joke in the film,negative
the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable are antonio banderas and jennifer beals,negative
marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role,negative
this movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great perhaps like a more upbeat plaza suite but it wasnt,negative
as trashy as it was some people will call it classic,negative
do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonnas chest showing a classic film,negative
look for more of kens kritic korner coming soon,negative
please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews,negative
p s four rooms made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995,negative
be warned,negative
the following review contains some harsh language,negative
the blair witch project,negative
quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time,negative
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy,negative
my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more,negative
and this worked for him,negative
well im sorry but nothing,negative
is nothing,negative
nothing is not more,negative
its nothiiiiiinggggggggggg,negative
i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing,negative
nothing is free available all around the world at a location near you,negative
i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary,negative
i could just discount them and say well i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow,negative
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesnt hold water,negative
there must be some other reason,negative
then again maybe my first thought is correct i think ill try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction,negative
when i hear people praising this film i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 of this movie three kids bickering with each other about being lost,negative
they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time,negative
this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout josh,negative
over and over,negative
this film should not be called the blair witch project it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost,negative
and argue with each other,negative
oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting josh,negative
and if you thought that was scary wait till you see a pile of rocks and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear,negative
oh yeah and some goo on one of their backpacks,negative
youve never seen terror like this folks and you dont want to,negative
the chevy hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film,negative
for current films i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience,negative
this film is an example of marketing with no substance,negative
the marketing was brilliant and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film,negative
they want this film to be good,negative
and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they dont have anything else to praise,negative
that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along but this is not it,negative
this film could have been so much better,negative
just think if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff,negative
i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it,negative
she was sold on this film,negative
and then at one point during it she turned to me and asked are,negative
we supposed to be scared by this,negative
ive heard one opinion that you have to use your imagination to create the fear in this movie,negative
well i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do,negative
use their imagination and create a good movie,negative
i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it,negative
but even if you like this idea then what are you imagining,negative
an entity called the blair witch,negative
some rednecks fucking with these kids,negative
are either of these things really scary when you think about it,negative
ive heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something,negative
well sure thats scary in real life but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting,negative
you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary but in a film it wouldnt be,negative
and no a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy,negative
actually the less the better see the equally awful remake of the haunting,negative
but you have to do something,negative
you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary if it were real,negative
and by the way about the shakycam filming in blair witch,negative
arent these supposed to be filmmakers who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly,negative
im not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified thats justified,negative
im talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they cant seem to shoot anything smoothly at all,negative
minor quibble there,negative
there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers,negative
that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank,negative
and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves what was i thinking,negative
but if they dont then thats fine,negative
if it works for them then thats okay i guess,negative
i just lament that by making this movie a hit we are going to be subjected to more of the nothing is more approach,negative
pretty soon were going to get some movies like this just a still shot of a prison jail cell,negative
for 90 minutes,negative
and well have to use our imagination and think to ourselves my god wouldnt it be scary to spend life in prison,negative
this movie is the scariest movie of all time,negative
or a shot of a coffin with some funeral directors arguing with each other,negative
man do you know how scary it would be to die,negative
now this is the scariest movie of all time,negative
r,negative
the formula is simple,negative
trap a varied group of people on an isolated location then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one,negative
these have been the successful ingredients for many good films the thing alien aliens and tremors to name a few,negative
so why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad,negative
see the relic for a particularly putrid example,negative
perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient effort and ideas,negative
deep rising meets these two requirements part way but not enough to salvage the film,negative
treat williams is finnegan the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services and their boat for any activity no,negative
questions asked,negative
this time however they may have gone too far,negative
their passengers led by the ominous wes studi are the type of multinational terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films,negative
and their cargo lets,negative
just say it has very high explosive potential,negative
what is the target of these thieves,negative
why the argonauticus of course a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage,negative
but something else is hunting the argonauticus something,negative
ancient and deadly,negative
by the time the thieves arrive nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed,negative
and now the creature senses fresh meat,negative
so you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew joining forces with the surviving passengers including the ship owner canton anthony heald and a thief with less lofty goals trillian famke janssen against the terror from the deep,negative
and the monster gets to pick them off one by one,negative
fortunately for the creature this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer,negative
why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food,negative
if theres a more clarion call for unity i dont know what it might be,negative
its pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when,negative
there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end,negative
for the most part the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audiences impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first,negative
although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsous life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad,negative
treat williams is a passable hero and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation,negative
but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way,negative
the biggest treat in the film however has to be pantucci kevin j oconnors whining engineboy under finnegans employ,negative
his constant quips may be a bit overwritten but they manage to capture the same vein of nerveaddled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens or todd graff as hippie in the abyss for that matter,negative
its just a stock part the comicrelief character but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable,negative
as far as the monster goes although the cgi is done well the creature has no logical consistency,negative
think back to the great or even just good movie monsters,negative
they all had a set of rules about what they could do and how and why they would do it,negative
part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering along with the heroes just what those rules are,negative
the tentacle monster in deep rising doesnt have a set of rules,negative
or if it does not a very good one,negative
it merely eats or drinks as the case may be and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so,negative
the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place,negative
it simply happens,negative
the action scenes are decent but few are noteworthy,negative
the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic,negative
deep risings peril in the water scenes pale next to camerons but can you really blame them,negative
unfortunately deep risings efforts are more on par with speed 2,negative
on the plus side however the films closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting but unlikely sequel,negative
perhaps youd be better off waiting for that one,negative
this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground despite some good performances from a basically competent cast,negative
eddie sean penn and maureen robin wright penn are a notsohappily married couple down on their luck,negative
living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city they spend what little income they have at the local bar owned by shorty stanton eddies best friend and his wife georgie mazar,negative
maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddies frequent disappearances,negative
on his return he promises her the world and professes his undying love,negative
their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows as eddie disappears again,negative
like a junky craving the next high maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high,negative
their relationship is further complicated by maureens pregnancy,negative
she wants the baby and the father but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter,negative
during one of eddies absences maureen is attacked by kiefer her neighbor who gets her drunk with her cooperation and then insists on intimacy,negative
she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do not to her but to kiefer,negative
she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage,negative
he lashes out as she expects and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months but in reality is 10 years,negative
during this decade maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual joey travolta in a small role,negative
her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her,negative
joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband and father of two children and stability joey makes a good living drives a cadillac and they live in a large house in the suburbs and the love of her previous life,negative
she chooses her past and sacrifices not only her new life but her old by giving up her and eddies daughter to joey,negative
but the eddie that she knew is gone replaced by a mere shell of the man he was,negative
maureen is herself a mere shell more an automaton than a woman as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him,negative
perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness or maybe the lack of sadness together but the movies denouement was not convincing,negative
this feature is like a double header two sets of clich s for the price of one,negative
not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts but the banal rich girlpoor boy love story is tossed in for good measure,negative
an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance,negative
the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins based on a story by falls merely lobs its plotline at the audience,negative
this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching,negative
summer catch centers around ryan dunne freddie prinze jr a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country,negative
ryan is a bluecollar kind of guy,negative
he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cods rich and famous,negative
he also as we are informed early his own worst enemy,negative
he has the potential and the talent but always seems to selfdestruct at the crucial moment,negative
so ryan tries to remained focused on baseball,negative
then he meets tenley parrish jessica biel daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures,negative
tenley a name only a hack screenwriter could invent is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan,negative
if you cant figure out where all this nonsense leads then you need a remedial course in film viewing,negative
as always prinze is pretty to look at but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions puppy dog love heartbreak frustration selfloathing or determination,negative
biel cries a lot while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her classconscious father,negative
the only beacon is matthew lillards funloving billy brubaker the teams catcher,negative
summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies such as bull durham and the natural,negative
no curve balls here no sliders,negative
every pitch is predictable,negative
a blind umpire could call this movie,negative
summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking,negative
it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn,negative
after enduring mariah careys film debut glitter im reminded of a bit from chris rocks bigger and blacker,negative
in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man rock says you can drive a car with your feet but that dont mean it should be done,negative
to that i say you can give mariah carey a movie but that certainly dont mean it should be done,negative
sure there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there from the beatles a hard days night to the spice girls spice world but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter,negative
everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous,negative
start off with the story which as gruesomely predictable as it is is the least offensive part of the movie,negative
the film is inexplicably set in the 80s a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers,negative
worse yet everyones speaking late 90s hiphop slang in what should be 1983,negative
meant to be partially autobiographical carey plays billie frank a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother,negative
influential club dj julian dice a k a lucky 7 max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro hears her sing on a track and decides to make her a star,negative
in predictably rapid succession billie and dice fall for each other she starts hitting it big dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass and suddenly billies on the roller coaster of superstardom,negative
in the meantime billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom,negative
i wont give away the ending but honestly just think of unicorns and rainbows,negative
youll figure it out,negative
the movie screams to be made with camp and that couldve been fun,negative
but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better,negative
what a mistake,negative
the brief attempts at comic relief as in a scene where an effeminate russiansounding director gets wacky with filming billies first music video go over like lead balloons,negative
instead the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariahs most dramatic scenes,negative
which brings us to the performances of which theres nothing good that can be said,negative
mariah is primarily seen with a wideeyed deerintheheadlights look frozen on her face,negative
she actually looks scared during her one love scene,negative
but you have to wonder if the writing isnt even worse,negative
so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for careys virginal target audience that its probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb,negative
even the characters couldnt have been written more absurdly,negative
theyre all members of a barbie playset the important film director who swoons billie id love to put you in a movie im making and the bigtime record executive who takes billies demo tape and says oh ill make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning,negative
everyone in the film is a device and its painful to keep watching just to see another one appear,negative
to say more would be a waste,negative
theres so much wrong with this film,negative
and it pains me that mariah carey with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays will have to suffer through all the negative reviews shes likely to get,negative
but then again i had to suffer through her movie,negative
the haunting a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film to scare us,negative
if youve ever seen a movie which you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie,negative
they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film,negative
but the one i always like are the quot other namequot joke that try and rename a particular film,negative
for instance the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film small soldiers,negative
they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size,negative
well after seeing the haunting i had a few particular names for it as well,negative
unfortunately i can only post one of them otherwise id be getting some pretty angry emails from overprotective mothers,negative
that title would be the confusing,negative
ok that is a pretty bad title but it fits this film perfectly,negative
it basically serves up no purpose and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb,negative
liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth,negative
the haunting is nothing but trash but unfortunately will still make a boatload of money,negative
before i rant and rave about how bad this film is let me point out the few and i stress the word few bright spots in this film,negative
first the house is great looking,negative
it looks beautiful but this is also a dark spot,negative
it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it,negative
this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film,negative
things look so great that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight,negative
haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie,negative
the hill house is not eerie,negative
it is beautiful but not the least bit frightening,negative
ever heard of lili taylor,negative
before this film i did not but i am glad that i do now,negative
she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film,negative
despite the dry dialogue and concept she manages to light up the screen every time she appears but unfortunately her costars are usually following right behind,negative
owen wilson who plays luke is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance other then taylor,negative
he is basically there for the comic relief and his character development is poor in all other areas,negative
all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped,negative
wilson had potential as luke but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs,negative
liam neeson and catherine zetajones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film,negative
their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot,negative
they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the hauntings coffin,negative
the plot is terrible,negative
the opening scene of the film is very important but the director makes it too obvious by getting closeups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film,negative
as i sat through the film i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish,negative
nell lili taylors character goes from the hunted to the savior,negative
it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film,negative
he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any indepth information,negative
for instance the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program,negative
but we get zilch for the other four,negative
plus two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes,negative
and the worst part most horror films have killings,negative
for some reason they kill off luke at the end of the film,negative
no reason whatsoever just off with his head literally,negative
overall the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie,negative
bad plot confusing storyline and a waste of good talent,negative
hopefully liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential,negative
hopefully lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film,negative
and hopefully other horror films such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house will not be as bad as this one,negative
some movies prerelease buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when theyre finally released everyone just goes along with it,negative
thus sometimes films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations,negative
last year it was the thin red line,negative
this years winner is the hurricane pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool,negative
acclaimed director norman jewisons biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun,negative
and thats supposed to be ok because see its a true story,negative
its about rubin hurricane carter denzel washington a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly racist,negative
detective dan hedaya whos had it in for the bigshot hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife in selfdefense but who cares right,negative
when rubin was only ten,negative
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole,negative
most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison,negative
to the rescue lesra martin vicellous reon shannon and his team of wannabe detectives,negative
lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three welloff canadian white people hanna unger schreiber to get an education,negative
lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book the sixteenth round rubins autobiography,negative
immediately thereafter schreibers character tells lesra sometimes we dont pick the books we read they pick us,negative
hmmm,negative
after a few visits to the prison they become convinced of rubins innocence and launch their own fullscale investigation even though two juries have convicted him,negative
they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricanes innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings,negative
of course were already told that hes innocent,negative
a movie like this is especially frustrating because were not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life,negative
all too obviously were getting the hollywood watered down version,negative
that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it,negative
its almost cruel,negative
the melodrama isnt of the entertaining kind either its the hokey rammeddownyourthroat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity,negative
witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudosaintliness of our four protagonists,negative
the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except its a nofrills courtroom movie,negative
its formula stripped to the bare necessities,negative
you have your wrongly accused black man,negative
you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene,negative
but theres nothing else,negative
youd expect some sort of involving investigation,negative
but thats not necessary since were implicitly informed of his innocence,negative
thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding,negative
brooding to himself,negative
brooding to other inmates,negative
brooding to lesra,negative
brooding to lesras canadian friends,negative
brooding in letters,negative
i dont think ill ever look at brooding the same way again,negative
it wasnt long before i got tired of hearing the hurricanes exceedingly deep meditations on his condition,negative
i wanted something to happen,negative
as for washingtons performance in the title role i figured id have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention its received he is top notch though still boring,negative
how is that possible,negative
well he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly,negative
unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap,negative
what a waste of a great performer,negative
speaking of wastes why the hell did john hannah agree to do this,negative
hes an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly but what is he doing here,negative
to call his character along with schreibers and ungers a stick figure would be a gross understatement,negative
all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas as benevolent as dogooders come,negative
if theyre to play a major part in this movie why not make them real people with real feelings and emotions,negative
look if youre going to make a formula movie dont undermine the formula,negative
courtroom dramas can be fun but this is ridiculous,negative
not only is it trite its boring,negative
what are we going to do with jim carrey,negative
viewers of televisions in living color know this oneman cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill,negative
viewers also know that in living color is a skitshow and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way,negative
unfortunately this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura pet detective,negative
three writers including carrey worked on the slapstick story which sends a selfstyled pet detective on the trail of a stolen dolphin,negative
the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl,negative
for plot porpoises this story works as well as any three stooges short,negative
carrey gets to do his official schtick as he snoops around greater miami,negative
he leers and sneers craning his neck to funny effect,negative
he even does his captain kirk impersonation,negative
again,negative
all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone other than carrey,negative
suggested alternate titlejim carrey will do anything for a laugh,negative
export it to france and you may have a hit,negative
as it stands ace ventura isnt even good kids stuff,negative
the profanity count alone is too high,negative
which is ironic since children are probably carreys best audience,negative
the film doesnt even have the goofball charm of chris elliotts recent nobrainer cabin boy,negative
sure carrey has his moments,negative
but what can you say about a film whose highpoints include watching carrey slink around to the theme from mission impossible,negative
ace ventura has one glaring incongruity,negative
amid the buttjokes and doubletakes the script takes great pains to setup an elaborate and rather funny crying game gag,negative
and for this intended audience that takes ahem cojones,negative
well i guess its that time of the year again,negative
the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even try writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions,negative
its also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases,negative
in america they call this time summer and it happens once every year,negative
and maybe its the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it but in the process normally weak insipid lines like consider this a divorce hasta la vista baby and youre the disease,negative
im the cure actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs,negative
this is not entirely a bad thing of course,negative
what am i talking about,negative
im talking about the summer blockbusters the action thrillers the thisobviouslycostalotsoyouknow everyonesgoingtogo explosions gas threats flying saucers and special effects,negative
in the rash of my what big guns you have but wait,negative
mine are bigger movies there are also the usual boymeetsfishandsavesenvironment movies or whale whatever and this year the odd crop of savetheworldfromaliensorenvironment threats offerings,negative
im talking about the three batmans the speeds the terminators etc this year im talking about twister independence day the arrival the rock mission impossible and of course eraser,negative
here in singapore as our local movie critics like to whine we seem to get the pick of the crop of my explosion is more reallooking than yours movies but nothing else,negative
mission impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us,negative
the same goes for eraser which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called mission unavoidable on account of its worldwide megaadvertising blitz eraser seems like a cheaper less thoughtful imitation,negative
thats saying a lot because mi the movie was already a cheap thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the 60s70s,negative
in eraser arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger,negative
he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and resituating them with new identities,negative
his new case is lee cullen played by vanessa williams who unlike all the other scumbags hes ever relocated is an actual real life honest person,negative
because shes so good and has such nice legs arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from his killers,negative
lee obtains evidence that the hightechnology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated blackmarket arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair,negative
of course as the formula goes her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck there are people in high places who will go down with this because yes this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world that is america since watergate,negative
in protecting lee arnold is framed by the mentorturnedevil robert deguerin nicely played by james caan and ends up having to prove that he isnt the one killing the programmes witnesses in addition to making sure lee isnt accidentally torpedoed to death by the new green guns his enemies all have,negative
its around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission impossible theme because arnies mission includes breaking into a highsecurity building to run a disk,negative
i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about,negative
its an electromagnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles and which can see through walls,negative
it has some sort of xray vision so its user can target the victims heart even from great distances,negative
despite this which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun though im certainly no expert however arnold whose own heart is targeted a number of times never goes flying 10 feet backwards with a twofoot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun,negative
instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous ill be back,negative
like everyone else in the theater i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily,negative
although there is a lot of violence in this movie not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators i recommend this movie to most over18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas,negative
reviews rating system wait for the video,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it,negative
unfortunately this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible directed by brian depalma,negative
the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever aside from the music,negative
the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork orchestrated by jim phelps allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world,negative
teamwork was the key,negative
this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalmas blow out where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions,negative
it was travoltas vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic,negative
in this film tom cruise is basically omniscient believe that and so theres no fun going on here whatsoever,negative
the story is about as contrived as contrived gets and is full of holes,negative
there are basically two memorable sequences one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room the second involves a highspeed train a helicopter and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved,negative
the actors are all miscast especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife who cannot act and ving rhames as a computer hacker who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie,negative
tom cruise is no james bond and jon voight looks more like bobby the brain heenan than jim phelps,negative
brian depalmas career has been bafflingly erratic,negative
at his best he beats hitchcock at his own game blow out carrie body double but this is not his best,negative
the screenplay was partly written by robert towne who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in chinatown but this script is perfunctory at best and terrrible at worst,negative
the cinematography has a comic book emphasis which is nice to look at but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape trick,negative
please dont spend your money on this itll only encourage hollywood to make more,negative
lauded as a genius by many stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such criticallyacclaimed films as 2001 a space odyssey a clockwork orange lolita and dr,negative
strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,negative
now sadly hes added eyes wide shut to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his nearflawless copybook,negative
kubrick alas should have quit while he was ahead,negative
this muchpublicized psychosexual teaseathon with its star billing of reallife marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman is nothing more than one long twoandahalf hours long boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut,negative
kubrick faithless to arthur schnitzlers 1926 novella dream story has confused eroticism with nudity,negative
he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly,negative
he has confused profundity with pretentiousness,negative
in addition the director has made some strange casting choices leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out,negative
pollack the director of such boxoffice hits as tootsie and out of africa is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here hes miserably out of his depth,negative
and there isnt much depth to begin with,negative
unhappily theres not likely to be a directors cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one,negative
in fact with the exception of the stark blackandwhite credits snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack and many many grainy tracking shots down lavishlydecorated corridors theres none of kubricks trademark brilliance in this film,negative
it doesnt help that the story as delivered is ridiculous,negative
cruise and kidman who bring little more than marital torpor to the project play welltodo new yorkers bill and alice harford,negative
hes a doctor and shes an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address,negative
at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler pollack alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy ironslike hungarian whos singularly determined to get her in the sack,negative
bill too is seen arminarm with a couple of models before hes pulled away to deal with an overdoser,negative
back home bill and alice smoke a little pot before alices aggressive jealousy kicks in,negative
as retribution she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed,negative
this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with blackandwhite images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman,negative
its all way too much for him,negative
for revenge bill almost has sex with a hooker,negative
he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store,negative
then he almost does the hookers roommate,negative
and hes almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious passwordprotected party where everyone wears masks and the women are incredible i e naked,negative
this erotic set piece a cultish bacchanal complete with chanting incense and lots of strategicallyplaced partygoers covering up the dirty might impress the likes of hugh hefner but its a lot less shocking than its intended to be,negative
whats the big deal,negative
bill doesnt exactly do anything other than throw his money and credentials around and alice only ever lusted in her heart,negative
whoopdeedoo,negative
still they make up at the same agonizingly slow pacewas kubrick notorious for multiple takes paying them at an hourly rate,negative
even geniuses have their bad days,negative
eyes wide shut just happens to be kubricks bad day an unerotic disappointing and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career,negative
an intimate characterdriven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life read the press notes for reachtherock,negative
im not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow completely uninvolving bore i sawat least it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film,negative
alessandro nivola plays robin fleming a troubled directionless 21yearold who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town,negative
police sergeant phil quinn william sadler takes him in and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneakouts and sneakins where robin slips out of his jail cell breaks a window then returns all without quinn ever noticing,negative
also added to the pointless proceedings is some wouldbe humorous shenanigans involving quinns dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna karen sillas,negative
with a half hour if even that long remaining director william ryan and writer john hughes yes john hughes of 80s youth films and homealone finally approach something close to a point,negative
turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise brooke langton who has long gone on with her life and hughess main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired live in the present and for the future message,negative
most moviegoers however will likely be asleep by that time,negative
wide awake however is the cast who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skillthus revealing the real purpose behind this listless enterprise to serve as a series of acting exercises,negative
such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors but it leaves audiences with a booby prize,negative
opens october 16,negative
the year is barely a week old and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997the relic a wouldbe chiller thats more successful at making the audience laugh than scream,negative
in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams whose last two pictures were dreadful jeanclaude van damme vehicles a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses hypothalamii of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum,negative
how did this creature come into existence and why does it feed on hormones,negative
the scientific explanation cooked up by the fouryes fourcredited screenwriters amy holden jones john raffo rick jaffa and amanda silver takes suspension of disbelief to new heights even by monster movie standards,negative
but as cockamamie as the science is in the film it isnt quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics,negative
miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears,negative
give it up penelopeits a monstermovie,negative
on the flip side tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant but his role is so thankless that its hard to imagine it being played any more effectively,negative
its quite funny to see a film indulge with the straightest of faces in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well and so recently in scream,negative
for example in one early scene a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night,negative
ok we all know whats coming but as if we didnt need any more confirmation he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away,negative
everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie,negative
and later miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing,negative
does she make a beeline for the front door,negative
of course notshe runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall,negative
with all the cliches it is only fitting the films climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film that of someone outrunning a fireball,negative
if the relic is truly the next evolution in terror as the poster states then the horror filmand humanityis in even worse shape than we thought,negative
one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles,negative
he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish and one of his best was his last film lone star,negative
after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the usmexico border expectation ran high for his next film,negative
unfortunately his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for,negative
we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do,negative
then the film does exactly what it promised a painful as that is,negative
the plot of men with guns can be summarized in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas,negative
dr fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went,negative
and he found out again and again and again,negative
of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell,negative
a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians,negative
but the film talks down to the viewer,negative
dr fuentes played by federico luppi teaches medicine in the capital city of his country,negative
he has as a great humanitarian gesture trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios,negative
fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service,negative
then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy,negative
in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others,negative
the student tells him the others are still in the mountains but suggests that it may not be a good place to be,negative
fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general,negative
the results are little different than one would expect,negative
dr fuentes starts out incredibly naive,negative
even some american tourists present in the film mostly for comic relief seem to know better than dr fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains,negative
but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was,negative
sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians,negative
the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences,negative
federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos,negative
damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter,negative
mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer,negative
whats to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornographyie,negative
the garbage known as snuff films,negative
nothing right,negative
whats to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography,negative
well nothing,negative
so why make it hollywood,negative
theres no reason why the average sane moviegoer will be interested in such a topic,negative
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this,negative
the lack of quality filmmaking in 8mm from technical to acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting castall reputable,negative
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again,negative
like paul schrader schumacher has his moments but theyre few and far far,negative
between,negative
basically this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it,negative
why not walk out,negative
well this wouldnt be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie,negative
heres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of 8mm,negative
first thingif you dont heed my advice then understand what youre about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud,negative
its not easy to watch,negative
i didnt know the details of the story beforehand but at least my ignorance can help others now,negative
the ha plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage as a surveillance expert and private investigator,negative
a rich old woman discovers a snuff film in her late husbands safe,negative
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl it had to be a young girl didnt it schumacher who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead,negative
shes horrified that her husband would have owned such a film in 8mm of course and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find,negative
familyman welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque murder,negative
let me backtrack for a moment,negative
see snuff films are pornos with a violent twistpeople are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead,negative
however the deaths are often staged and in those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference,negative
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hardtofind movies,negative
the thought of this industry makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review but ill swallow my bile and move on,negative
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry,negative
youd think hes sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him,negative
he comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze,negative
after a lot of digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films,negative
skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead,negative
led by dino velvet peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance and startorturer machine christopher bauer they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue,negative
the movie doesnt end there unfortunately because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films dobecome a vigilante,negative
this film doesnt draw you in,negative
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close,negative
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ie,negative
se7en but it takes a large measure of restraint schumacher has none and a larger amount of talent schumacher has little,negative
by those jabs im not only referring to his stylish destruction of the batman franchise but a time to kill was an immensely overrated disappointment,negative
for a guy who gets so much studio money his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled,negative
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter,negative
writer andrew kevin walker didnt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for 95s twisted thriller se7en,negative
director schumacher doesnt have that innate ability to make you watch things you dont really want to see like better directors are capable of doing,negative
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we dont see is more frightening than what we do especially when its a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered,negative
however gratuitous is joels middle name,negative
he must think that not flaunting a hardcore act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint,negative
no he doesnt go that far but we see enough unpleasantness,negative
he doesnt leave much to the imagination,negative
its manipulating to hurt or kill young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante,negative
the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ha ha,negative
craft,negative
case in point a shot of a christian fellowship bus good right,negative
drives away to reveal one of the villains bad right,negative
see no,negative
subtlety,negative
does joel think were stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery,negative
who do we root for in this mess,negative
is there anybody out there,negative
its not all the directors fault though,negative
why did the actors sign up for this,negative
nicolas cage is an oscarwinner for cryin out loud,negative
if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda,negative
what is cage supposed to be in this moviea whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears,negative
villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy,negative
and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash,negative
he was so solid as a concerned father in a civil action,negative
i guess ol nic pete and jim were promised a mountain of money or,negative
theyre suckers,negative
or they just dont care,negative
there are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland,negative
catherine keener is good although too quick to threaten divorce as mrs wells,negative
baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet,negative
the mother amy norton of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter,negative
this film has an appropriate bluetoned washedout look like payback which was a much better movie,negative
the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue but at other times its rough,negative
during some conversations closeups and wide shots are not cut very well making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts arent good and whose timing was a halfsecond off,negative
such a technical error indeed stands out,negative
speaking of standing out dont believe the misleading trailers,negative
theres not much action here,negative
occasionally yes but not as often as your tv will have you believe,negative
after seeing 8mm i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again,negative
is that a positive,negative
well if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive theyve done a swell job here,negative
itll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chanceunless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved,negative
but today im not depraved so i ask why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it,negative
im sure that somewhere right now theres some pretty sick crap going on but that doesnt mean i need to know about it,negative
yes mr walker your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there,negative
yes mr walker the proverbial monster doesnt look like we expect him to,negative
you said all that in 1995,negative
move on,negative
this film serves no purpose,negative
it doesnt entertain it doesnt teach us anything it doesnt make a statement beyond the obvious this stuff is bad approach,negative
only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile,negative
thats not likely to happen though so 8mm is indeed a scummy waste of money,negative
orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film to movies to,negative
good movies,negative
if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole,negative
like snuff films 8mm should never have been made,negative
now excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it,negative
useless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme,negative
he used it in batman forever in batman robin in a time to kill in falling down and its rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow,negative
practical magic is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and highprofile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing claptrap like this one,negative
the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches spanning back 200 years,negative
at the start their parents die when they are still children and they go to live with their two zany aunts stockard channing and dianne wiest,negative
switch to the present day gillian who is the stronger more rebellious sibling leaves home and meets up with a dark abusive guy goran visjnic while sally stays in their hometown meets and falls in love with a sweet caring man has two children and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed come to think of it shes not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes,negative
when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic they accidentally murder him and in desperation bury the body in the backyard of their aunts house,negative
add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism not to mention a spattering of lighthearted whimsy and you have a pretty good idea how messy practical magic is,negative
after seeing the film i reflected that there was not even one scene or element that i liked or enjoyed,negative
it is a comedy to be sure but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching,negative
it is not charming or entertaining in any way,negative
and then to top it off weve got this dark but birdbrained story of an evil spirit taking over gillians body,negative
whatever,negative
the characters are handled terribly and actually most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character,negative
there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film and in every scene involving them they are always standing sidebyside,negative
no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people,negative
the same goes for aidan quinn as a handsome police investigator who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock even though he comes into it at around the 70minute mark and once again there is no attempt to develop their relationship or his character in any way,negative
in fact every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along rather than getting to know the people saying the lines,negative
i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman who managed to destroy the batman series with batman forever and batman and robin,negative
practical magic is directed by griffin dunne primarily an actor who last year made the contrived clumsy romance addicted to love with meg ryan and matthew broderick,negative
i disliked that movie quite a bit but since practical magic is even worse that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is,negative
id tell him to quit while hes ahead but in these last two years hes ultimately already buried himself,negative
in a typical cinematic high school the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them but not before the boys scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books,negative
as the sexual acts take place the other guys hang out nearby guzzling beer and grunting like pigs,negative
in the rage carrie 2 robert mandels terminally bland sequel to carrie there isnt a single original moment,negative
only amy irving returns from carrie and the talent of the rest of the sequels cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreus script,negative
as rachel the horror storys lead emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory but it isnt exactly her fault,negative
the director asks for little from his actors which is precisely what he gets,negative
sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim,negative
her fellow students delight in tormenting her,negative
of course she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers,negative
as the movie marks time until its big finale it throws in some repugnant scenes hoping to turn audiences stomachs,negative
rachels girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made love to her the night before spurns her,negative
he gets major points in his black book for this but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death,negative
even a helpless puppy is run over and we see his poor little body flipping over and over under a truck,negative
the teenagers in the movie are completely blas about it all,negative
doesnt it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday asks one of the few kids with a conscience,negative
why,negative
responds his nonplussed girlfriend,negative
she wasnt anybody,negative
remarkably devoid of any energy especially for a horror flick the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theaters armrest,negative
with material this bad the films only hope is to go for parody but it isnt smart enough to realize it,negative
even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie,negative
the rage carrie 2 runs 1 45,negative
it is rated r for graphic violence teen alcohol abuse sex nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers,negative
in the finale of disneys mighty joe young a 15foot tall 2000pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground,negative
upon impact rugged everyman and perennial dogooder bill paxton rushes in containing the emotional crowd with an earnest move along now folks theres nothing to see here,negative
ok so those arent exactly the words he uses but its probably one of the few clich s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies king kong,negative
1949s mighty joe young was an update of that classic creature feature also based on merian c coopers original story 16 years after kong it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable,negative
now some 49 years later at least according to disneys way of thinking the world is ready for one more,negative
not so,negative
the onlyand i mean onlyreason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects,negative
and these unfortunately run hot and cold,negative
todays joe young is designed and produced by specialeffects whiz rick baker who has been wowing audiences with his stateoftheart makeup effects since 1971s schlock which incidentally featured a bakerenhanced gorilla,negative
joe is a combination of animatronic effects computer graphics and that old standard a man in a monkey suit,negative
while there are occasional flashes of brilliancebakers had a lot of practice with simian effects after all including gorillas in the mist greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes and the 1976 remake of king kong theres also some surprising cheesiness,negative
one of the films most embarrassing moments is when paxtons band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the largerthanlife primate in a scene unashamedly ripped off from the lost world jurassic park,negative
paxton jubilantly extols the beasts majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe and the computer effects driving him stutter to a halt,negative
also if the films producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldnt have paraded female lead charlize theron trial error around in a seeminglyendless wardrobe of spaghettistrapped tops,negative
even joe seems distracted at times,negative
the film piles on the clich s like theres no tomorrow including the predictable plot anthrozoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l a where urban havoc is inevitably wrought predictable villain a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace predictable love story bill and charlizesurprise and predictable denouement twas boxoffice receipts that killed the beast,negative
kids raised on men in black nonmonkey effects also by baker are going to find ron tremors underwoods outing a little lame by comparison,negative
while certainly better than 1978s king kong lives itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake mighty joe young proves how the mighty keep falling,negative
burnt money is the perfect festival film,negative
it will show once or twice and then no one thankfully will ever have to hear from it again,negative
this film from the seattle international film festival 2001s emerging masters series is easily one of the years worst,negative
billed as a gay bonnie and clyde this gritty film from director marcelo pi eyro has its only highlight in a welldesigned title sequence,negative
two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader whose plan they screwed up angry,negative
this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys one of whom may not actually be gay,negative
hiding out in a prostitutes apartment the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movies conclusion,negative
if caught they risk losing all the money and their love,negative
as an added emotional bonus one of the gay men is dying,negative
or something like that,negative
everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost,negative
clarity isnt exactly this movies striving virtue so it was a little hard to pick up,negative
not much could have really happened though,negative
the main events in this long twohour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex graphic drug use extreme violence and strong language,negative
lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when theres a reason but theres no purpose to anything in this film,negative
most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing,negative
it appears pi eyro who cowrote with marcelo figueras from a novel by ricardo piglia purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement,negative
he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible makes them snort cocaine gives them guns and condoms and lets them go,negative
burnt money is pointless,negative
the performances are bad,negative
it tries to thrill and shock but only causes boredom,negative
god forbid it will ever get a distributor,negative
another disappointing film from this years socalled emerging masters series,negative
pass on by,negative
here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy bait starring jamie foxx and david morse,negative
this is a review i dont even want to write because id just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other sogenericandpredictableitsbeyondridiculous piece of hollywood fluff,negative
if theyre not going to give us the audience just a little credit and put something together with half a brain why should i waste my time and mental energy criticising it,negative
last summer i took this same approach with my review of the mummy in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other subpar movies,negative
i think i shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes not all are applicable,negative
i hope this goes to show you what i think of bait and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild guess,negative
its genuinely unfunny i and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours unoriginal and unthrilling,negative
its not so bad to the point where its fun to watch because of its badness and its no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it its just such a cliche in and of itself that uhh,negative
lost my train of thought,negative
anyways heres those quotes enjoy,negative
getting an audiences attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how todays films work,negative
we want to have something exciting to watch not a slow buildup of a story god forbid and this film plays right into the mainstreams hands,negative
review of armageddon,negative
its clear the film doesnt want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability the most minimal amount necessary comes across as a halfassed effort,negative
supporting characters and shady supplots are introduced but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters only a handful have any real significance,negative
theres a fine line separating homage from plagiarism review of godzilla 1998,negative
unfortunately as is the case with most modern thrillers once the film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence the cliches and action sequences take over review of the jackal,negative
chadz movie page is back after heavy renovation,negative
reviews of nearly all mainstream movies playing today,negative
get my reviews of everything playing at your local cineplex so you can better make an informed decision on what to see,negative
dont forget to vote on my poll and sign the guestbook,negative
your first clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see its heavily christmasthemed and its release date is oh say at the end of february,negative
your second clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see charlize theron one of the movies dubious stars makes an appearance on the daily show in which when asked if her new movies any good she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh,negative
assuring us that yeah it sure is a movie all right,negative
and theres some scenes like those youd expect to find in a movie and theres some action,negative
and theres other,negative
stuff,negative
too,negative
how to immediately grab my attention open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits,negative
then show a caption reading six days earlier,negative
ya know i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas,negative
how to immediately lose my attention follow your opening scene with a terminally dull niceguyswhodontdeservetobeinprison scene,negative
write a line for the one of prisoners like i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad,negative
then have ben affleck actually say that line on film and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor,negative
for good measure throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have afflecks best buddy stabbed,negative
aw,negative
and just two days before his release too,negative
already the cliches are piled on thick and when it rains it pours,negative
how to take my attention dash it violently against the rocks and make it so that im contemplating my strategy for calling shotgun about an hour before i know the credits will roll deny your characters the ability to think,negative
have ben affleck for some reason ill never understand pretend hes his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend played by charlize theron,negative
have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist,negative
the villains big idea,negative
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are then dress up in santa suits create some diversions and rob the place,negative
on paper it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks hes looking at the makings for some sort of clever actioncrime thriller,negative
its not like the man isnt capable,negative
far from it,negative
hes the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may,negative
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases ive ever seen in last years ronin,negative
but hes certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers,negative
put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr moreau,negative
step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible cast ben affleck in the role of the worlds most generic hero,negative
he gets no good oneliners he doesnt get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie,negative
his name is rudy short for rudolph in all likelihood,negative
see its called reindeer games,negative
get it,negative
get it,negative
shut up,negative
in the past affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man,negative
step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible gary sinises villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with,negative
hes dirty and pottymouthed hes got long scruffy hair and a goatee and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them,negative
hes also extremely inept at what he does,negative
he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises and he trusts afflecks character to pull through even after time and time and time again he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him,negative
but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role sinise seems to think hes playing some sort of tough smart and smooth criminal mastermind rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script,negative
on a side note gary sinise wins this weeks title,negative
award as hes the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings,negative
last weeks winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards,negative
how to take your bad idea and make things worse include two or three plot twists that instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely,negative
this is a bad movie,negative
and whats worse is that except for a few moments near the notsostunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad,negative
if theyd done that much at least i would have been entertained,negative
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,negative
be forewarned,negative
quick robin,negative
the antishark repellant,negative
adam west in the 1966 batman feature film casually kicking at a patheticlooking rubber shark attached to his leg,negative
i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard,negative
this is a disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive its loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill,negative
batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris odonnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemicallyinduced villains the nefarious icecold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss,negative
by ivys side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson a grunting hulk of a beast,negative
the villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivys intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life,negative
meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone,negative
akiva goldsmans screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful bythenumber plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement,negative
it makes goldsmans screenplay of batman forever which i thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison,negative
i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which id seen used in no joke an episode of gilligans island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production,negative
joel schumachers direction of batman and robin is horrific with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance,negative
there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case i suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterlypointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivys chosen new abode,negative
another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving latenight motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons,negative
mr schumachers focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between allout camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective,negative
it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the films opening even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered,negative
is batman and robin supposed to be campy,negative
i think it is its hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously,negative
one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb,negative
each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory,negative
is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be,negative
i somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isnt attempting to be the utter farce which it is,negative
arnold schwarzenegger is topbilled in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be,negative
mr schwarzeneggers attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable,negative
by the end of the film i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen,negative
the bulk of his performance consists of uttering nearunintelligble puns and oneliners featuring every possible permutation of cool,negative
in the least inventive way,negative
george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film,negative
his batman is hardly an imposing figure,negative
chris odonnell is unimpressive in a onenote performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all,negative
the films one saving grace,negative
undoubtably uma thurmans entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy,negative
her work in batman and robin is certainly overthetop but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film,negative
ms thurmans comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully,negative
im already starting to positively reassess jim carreys performance in batman forever,negative
her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when shes offscreen the film greatly suffers,negative
i figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isnt a halfbad way to go,negative
while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulsepounding excitement i must admit that i was not bored watching it although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or oneliner and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat,negative
its been a long time since ive laughed so much at a movie,negative
at of course is the operative word,negative
play it to the bone is a punchdrunk mess of a movie,negative
containing a good cast but awful acting an interesting premise but terrible execution ron shelton white men cant jump gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two,negative
rocky no 1 is vince boudreau woody harrelson edtv a bald tattooed newly converted christian whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word,negative
something that he has not yet successfully achieved,negative
rocky no 2 is caesar dominguez antonio banderas the 13th warrior best friend of vince who is currently dating vinces exgirlfriend grace,negative
both men are nearing the end of their almost careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity,negative
when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement,negative
our boys are tapped to fight each other the winner of which is promised a shot at a future title fight,negative
the film is divided into two sections,negative
at first we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes in graces sassy grassy green muscle car travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day,negative
along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by,negative
once in vegas the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar,negative
both mr harrelson and mr banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past not that wed know it from their work here,negative
mr harrelson is uncomfortably awkward apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince,negative
the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable,negative
mr banderas is uncharacteristically noncharismatic as caesar,negative
weak and ineffectual there is little life in his screen performance,negative
the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another,negative
tom sizemore saving private ryan robert wagner austin powers ii the spy who shagged me and richard masur fire down below are crooked promoters lucy liu payback is a sexstarved hitchhiker looking for a good time and lolita davidovich gods and monsters is the shared girlfriend who cant make her mind up which boxer she prefers,negative
because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins,negative
but even then because the outcome is so predictably obvious the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other,negative
ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed wellchoreographed welledited and wellperformed,negative
if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film,negative
as it is the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable,negative
the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film,negative
the phrase play it to the bone is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until youve achieved your desired goal,negative
that is a biblical principle,negative
know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize,negative
so run that ye may obtain,negative
1 corinthians 9 24 kjv,negative
achieving anything worthy in life requires playing it to the bone,negative
we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives,negative
this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives,negative
as a movie play it to the bone is hardly worth our time,negative
but as a principle of life the phrase play it to the bone are words to live by,negative
a new entry in the revisionist history genre of filmmaking dick suggests that two nottoobright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nations biggest presidential scandal,negative
kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlenes watergate hotel room accidentally stumble across g gordon liddy played deadon by harry shearer and the infamous breakin,negative
when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip they are ushered into a conference room questioned as to what they know and leave as official presidential dog walkers,negative
the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with,negative
when they discover that nixon another deadon performance by dan hedaya who actually favors nixon slightly unlike anthony hopkins has been abusive to checkers the presidential dog thanks to the conversations that he always recorded they quit and become disillusioned,negative
during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein events are set into motion that eventually lead to the presidents resignation,negative
this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry kingtype talk show featuring a cameo by french stewart about revealing the identity of deep throat,negative
from there we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad dick joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy,negative
at one point the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial,negative
the band manages to stop right as dunst screams you have to stop letting dick run your life,negative
much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot,negative
several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film,negative
if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault its juvenile bathroom humor but its not,negative
the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audiences throat in the least subtle way possible,negative
i dont recall oliver stones nixon having to pander to its audience but of course that film wasnt a comedy aimed squarely at a 1320 yearold film going audience,negative
the only redeeming thing about this movie is its remarkable supporting cast,negative
i wanted to see more of ferrell and mccullochs woodward and bernstein,negative
those two characters are the sole basis for my rating,negative
i wish they had been given more screen time but unfortunately they are only relegated to the final halfhour,negative
their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight especially mccullochs constant thwarting of ferrells attempts to gather information from the girls who in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsys brother,negative
the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters but are given nothing to work with,negative
id like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities,negative
as for the two leads dunst and williams can definitely do better,negative
they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele the early years in this particular film a highly dubious distinction at best,negative
stay through the first half of the end credits though to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie,negative
an excellent idea marred by poor execution dick could have been a great movie,negative
less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds,negative
as it stands though dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as dick and poopie jokes,negative
and that to me does not make a funny movie,negative
pg13,negative
note to screenwriters and self when you hit the big time and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer tell em all to hit the road,negative
gilligan wrote the arbitrarilytitled home fries ten years ago it was shelved until he found success as one of the took a second look at gilligans comedy they read it again wearing rosetinted glasses,negative
drew stars as sally a dim but sweet pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states,negative
the father of her child is dead the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons these flyboys scared him with their lowflying helicopter,negative
dorian wilson and angus busey were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ohara,negative
trouble is sally picked up some interference on her drivethru headset and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing,negative
so dorian goes undercover as a burgerflipper before you can say with cheese he falls for the mothertobe,negative
too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally,negative
does this sound like a movie you want to see,negative
without a doubt the best thing about home fries is barrymore at the risk of sounding sexist shes never looked better than here as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes,negative
she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look applecheek cute and gawk at wilson her reallife boyfriend,negative
but the plot and the situations are so offputting that nothing could save it,negative
this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers but home fries brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel,negative
its raising arizona without babies without charm without laughs without human characters and without intelligence worst of all its creepy,negative
whats funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun,negative
unless the woman in question is a spice girl,negative
take out the helicopters the quasiincestuous relationship between the mother and her sons it is absolutely illogical within the movies framework that dorian still lives with his mother and brother and the scenes of murder attempted and otherwise and what are you left with,negative
the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint but dreams of becoming a country singer,negative
that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made but itd be better than home fries,negative
my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies,negative
we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills the corny dialog the ludicrous premises and the bad acting,negative
since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together,negative
i cant remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along,negative
he was not amused,negative
i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained,negative
perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity,negative
i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing insulting my intelligence and brought adequate moviemaking skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made at least in terms of the craft,negative
the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque,negative
this movie slaps you with conception pregnancy delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames without pausing for infancy,negative
the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a womans womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an insideout cesarean,negative
an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect,negative
in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp it is used only after the skull has been exposed,negative
the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good,negative
the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle as bad as it gets,negative
as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck,negative
eve natasha henstridge was cloned from sil the original alien sexual predator but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner,negative
in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer marg helgenberger i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet,negative
its enough to melt the most callous heart,negative
at another point she protests im human too you know,negative
she is only half right,negative
peter medak the director knows his business,negative
justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials,negative
james cromwell his father is perfect in a short role,negative
marg heldenberger the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful,negative
natasha is an exquisite ornament,negative
george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up,negative
michael madsen was there,negative
black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits which is more that we can say for lazard,negative
synopsis nice girl susanne has sex with her boyfriend daniel in his car visits daniels rich family during thanksgiving at their mansion in the middle of nowhere and has sex with daniel again in the basement,negative
susanne and daniel must then decide where to hide from evil art thieves who shoot everyone else in the mansion to steal paintings,negative
brace yourself for one of those painfully obvious surprise endings,negative
comments thanksgiving,negative
for most its a time to be with your loved ones and enjoy a good homecooked meal,negative
for the makers of body count however thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders violence profanity family dysfunction and sex,negative
boy do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap,negative
alyssa milano the former child star of whos the boss matures to madeforvideo sludge like this movie,negative
someone somewhere thought itd be a great idea to pair her with rapper icet who has since gueststarred in the madeforthescifichannel series welcome to paradox,negative
this isnt exactly a winning combination,negative
outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me what else may be said for this turkey,negative
well it teaches us that beautiful attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed and complain about being english teachers,negative
it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic stuckup rich white people waited on by black servants,negative
it shows us that old guys try not to laugh sit around and talk about the appeal of postmodernism during their free time,negative
and it proves that you can have sex in your parents basement when they have a dozen or so guests over and no one will notice,negative
before i go any further if any young male reading this has hopes of seeing alyssa naked forget it,negative
the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you dont see any of milanos attributes,negative
they do however inexplicably throw in a scene where icet whistles jingle bells after killing people for whatever thats worth,negative
this film was originally titled below utopia,negative
perhaps they should have renamed it hell,negative
avoid this clunker,negative
the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows jane march was very cute as jane and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length,negative
if you havent already figured it out i didnt like this movie very much,negative
the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme,negative
tarzan casper van dien has now left the jungle and living in civilized society,negative
he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane played by the aptly named jane march,negative
back in his former home of africa a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city,negative
mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city,negative
anyway tarzans old jungle friend appears to him in a vision,negative
tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city,negative
he leaves jane his first mistake in my opinion and travels to africa,negative
of course jane is hot on her ape mans heals,negative
the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys,negative
sound like a dumb explanation of the plot,negative
its actually an improvement over the real thing,negative
the acting is just plain awful,negative
im not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film but it wasnt acting,negative
jane march wasnt a heck of a lot better but at least she is easy on the eyes,negative
compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been rerecorded and ive seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies,negative
added to the sound problems was the cinematography,negative
this film was filled with beautiful african scenery,negative
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me,negative
quite frankly i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment,negative
then we have the special effects,negative
special effects in a tarzan movie,negative
you are no doubt asking yourself,negative
yes friends the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story,negative
probably for the sake of using cgi since it did nothing but hurt the story,negative
in most parts they werent bad just nothing special,negative
but they were more than a little on the hokey side,negative
except of course when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie,negative
the grand finales special effects went right into the toilet at that point,negative
it almost looked like they had run out of money,negative
these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production,negative
i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors dont mix,negative
stay far away from this version of tarzan,negative
mr nice guy is the latest jackie chan film so you should know what to expect,negative
a weak plot terrible dialogue very little acting ability but some jawdropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile,negative
however mr nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever,negative
jackie chan plays who else jackie,negative
this time out hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show,negative
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot,negative
there are only two scenes of him cooking,negative
for the rest of the film somehow he mutates into jackie chan supercop,negative
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege,negative
a tv newswoman diana gabrielle fitzpatrick covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo richard norton and a local gang of toughs the demons,negative
although she only has one camcorder somehow the result is full of closeups and multiple angles hmmm,negative
shades of broadcast news,negative
anyway the goons discover diana and will do anything to recover the tape,negative
here lies another crucial flaw in the story doesnt anyone realize you can copy a tape,negative
oh well no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense,negative
as luck would have it diana runs across jackie and wouldnt you know it jackie accidentally ends up with the tape,negative
this leads to countless chase fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie,negative
in a move apparently designed to woo american and other englishspeaking audiences the film uses english as its primary language,negative
however that doesnt mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases,negative
strangely many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english and poorly too,negative
whether this is just a very bad case of looping an effort to minimize accents or a simple case of nostalgia it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films,negative
the plot in mr nice guy is negligible merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons,negative
but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackies films it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread,negative
look if you have jackie chan playing a chef why not use that to your advantage,negative
watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts,negative
the action is a mixed bag here,negative
theres really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films,negative
it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan,negative
the action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes,negative
the films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting,negative
once or twice it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence,negative
but to slomo jackie running,negative
either this is a nod to the sixmillion dollar man or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down,negative
if youve seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix go ahead and see mr nice guy,negative
however if youre just in the mood for some good action youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work such as supercop,negative
so much for sweet returns,negative
after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80s slasher movies starting with 1996s scream and followed by scream 2 urban legend and the original i know what you did last summer a film like i still know what you did last summer was bound to be made sooner or late,negative
it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out and that is because they reached for the lowestcommondenominator in filmmaking favoring nonstop deaths and gore for suspense and trading in fleshed out likable characters for onedimensional nitwits,negative
it has been exactly one year since julie james jennifer love hewitt suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road and then thinking he was dead dumped him into the ocean,negative
since then julie has relocated to boston university and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams she has been able to put her life back together,negative
when julies friend karla brandy is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people which also includes karlas horny boyfriend tyrell mekhi phifer and will matthew settle who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend ray freddie prinze jr also returning from the original doesnt show up,negative
when they reach the secluded island they discover it is the last day of the open season and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them,negative
of course julie her friends and the workers arent the only ones there as the murderous ben willis dressed in fisherman garb returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all,negative
it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like i still know what you did last summer is made,negative
i am a very big fan of horror movies and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to ikwydls which i am a fan of is almost an exact replica of a friday the 13th movie,negative
while the original focused more on the story and characters as well as genuinely suspenseful moments thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson who didnt return to write the sequel and it shows i still know,negative
has no story to speak of and is so vacuous of ideas that the filmmakers were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested,negative
also gone are any signs of character development and since every single character died before i got to know them all i was left with was to stare at the screen indifferent to what was going on,negative
while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died,negative
they were all paperthin and pointless except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman,negative
another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted setpieces like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar but there are none to speak of in this sequel although they do come close at one moment with brandy,negative
since so many people were killed every couple minutes the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water,negative
also of note is the mystery of the second killer and accomplice to ben but it is obvious from the first frame who it is and so i couldnt even have fun at that like i did in the scream movies and urban legend,negative
it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else,negative
maybe the people who made i still know what you did last summer should have realized that in order to make a good movie you must have a screenplayor at least one that isnt such a black hole for thoughts and ideas,negative
the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead,negative
a sensuous romantic comedy about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom,negative
there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out its the kind of stuff ive seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny,negative
the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen lope cruz who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot but who cant get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story,negative
pen lope was wonderful in pedro almod vars all about my mother but here she is so visible in such a stale story where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking that she somehow looks ridiculous as if she got egg all over her face,negative
the best you can say about her is that shes not to blame for this picture being so off,negative
this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex is in my opinion worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will,negative
the story is all about the love motion sickness and cooking ability of isabella cruz who is born in bahia brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents cook,negative
to cure her motion sickness her parents tried every remedy until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure,negative
she is able to control it now as long as she doesnt drive a car ride elevators follow in dancing and is the woman on top when making love,negative
in other words she has to be in control of things,negative
in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter toninho oliveira murilo ben cio and marries him,negative
they open up a successful restaurant where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it even though hes a loafer,negative
one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco,negative
we dont see her in flight so i cant tell how she handled her motion sickness problem unless she flew the plane,negative
she visits her friends apartment monica harold perrineau jr who is a crossdresser blending right into the san francisco scene,negative
to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell freeing her from ever loving him again,negative
her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff mark feurerstein gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show,negative
you can really write the script from here on by yourself as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had but things continue to go bad for him there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village there is no chef to replace his wife as the restaurant is about to close for good,negative
so he comes to san francisco figuring he can charm her again,negative
he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians the ones he used when courting her when he serenaded her under her window,negative
he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick the yuppie tv producer chasing after her and sees that she is no longer charmed by him,negative
when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her the ratings go up and hes hired as a regular on the show,negative
the show gets so big that the network honchos come onboard taking it national,negative
but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show get rid of monica because hes a freak have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses and they change her ethnic dresses to lowcut vanna white type of sexy dresses,negative
cliff her wouldbe boyfriend acts creepy and sides with the network bigshots even though he loved everything she did,negative
these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos they were revolting,negative
it was an insult to ones intelligence,negative
im sure that im not spoiling the ending for anyone when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again,negative
if the film wasnt terrible enough monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers,negative
it was so awkwardly done that it had no sense of truth or humor to it,negative
this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film because it doesnt look or feel like an almod var film the type of film it aspired to be but more like a film that was interferred with from above,negative
its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic as it searches for box office heaven,negative
at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong,negative
but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers thinking the performance was planned and applauding it for their efforts,negative
thats dirty work in a nutshell,negative
a very different kind of movie,negative
this is not a movie that i can easily review,negative
the critic in me analyzes the structure plot acting characters,negative
and,negative
tells me this movie is terrible,negative
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing,negative
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie,negative
its a one note concept,negative
mitch and sam need 50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients,negative
realizing they are very good at revenge plots they open a revenge for hire business eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald who after roles in happy gilmore and veronicas closet seems typcast in this role who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriends grandmother thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house,negative
first the critic in me,negative
the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way,negative
heres the catch,negative
none of the characters are sympathetic,negative
theyre all selfish jerks who dont care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want,negative
the jokes are juvenile crude appealing to the worst elements in people,negative
theres jokes about prostitutes the homeless beastiality anal sex,negative
theres even a subplot thats developed it seems only to make jokes about infidelity and incest,negative
and i loved watching it,negative
i was a huge fan of norm macdonalds sarcastic tothepoint comedy on saturday night live and this movie is an hour and a half of it,negative
norm macdonald takes a joke strips it to the core and tells it like it is with a dry wit,negative
like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job,negative
the foreman goes over the basics which mitch and sam dont understand,negative
how do they get out of it,negative
by admiting they lied on their resumes and dont know a thing about construction,negative
and surprise they get fired,negative
the characters are incredibly meanspirited,negative
theres a father whos loud and obnoxious a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his fathers condition by saying if i were a gambling man id put a lot of money on death,negative
the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky and does who knows what with it,negative
and then theres mitch and sam who thinking they can get 50000 by destroying a building ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents,negative
too bad we have to do it mitch says,negative
heres a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up where you see every punchline coming where every spot profanity could be used and then is used,negative
at least the film is honest and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic,negative
but at least it isnt dull and it isnt predictable,negative
and thats the way it should be,negative
its sketch comedy and if youre a fan of norm macdonald youll love it,negative
the jokes are crude the characters are mean to the core the attitude of the movie is that it just doesnt care,negative
if you dont like norm macdonald or stupid movies then you probably wont like this one,negative
the jokes are crude the characters are mean to the core the attitude of the movie is that it just doesnt care,negative
so before seeing this one tune your mindset and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor gay animal sex prison rape jokes uncaring characters and one last performance from chris farley,negative
the critic in me says but i give it an 8,negative
i just couldnt stop laughing,negative
americas favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in bride of chucky and their unholy matrimony is something old nothing new,negative
the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers however has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their bloodsoaked honeymoon,negative
the answer is a sickandtwisted yes and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hotenoughtomeltrubber or at least singe it lovin,negative
guess theyre anatomically correct,negative
chucky again voiced by brad dourif of course is the star of the childs play series a my buddytype doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer,negative
in bride the plot heh picks up with his girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly resurrecting chuckys remains he was blown up at the end of childs play 3 with the help of a black arts manual called voodoo for dummies,negative
silly mortal,negative
before long shes also been reduced to shinhigh figurine status and the plastic incarnations of these onetime lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies,negative
the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young couple nick stabile and katherine heigl with conjugal plans of their own leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical soultransferring amulet allegedly lies in wait,negative
along the way our murderous barbie and ken go through postmarriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds bicker argue kiss and make up,negative
but when they squabble over whos going to do the dishes watch out,negative
hey even faux people have got to work through their problems,negative
director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing,negative
when one of them charges its nothing a good forward punt couldnt take care of,negative
and when a climactic chase scene is needed one of the dimbulb protagonists must pickchuckyup so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint,negative
throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending will son of chucky be next and this is a bizarrely bad 89minutes at the movies,negative
as is the thing to do in post scream slasher cinema don mancinis screenplay slathers on the injokes and genreparody,negative
but little of the humor succeeds proving selfreference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite,negative
to be fair though most of bride of chucky is on autopilot so its not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film,negative
similarly shaky the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland the effects arent that special and the story is one big groaner,negative
heres hoping chucky and his entire clan past present and future rest in peace,negative
actually im fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie,negative
baywatch babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her doubleds on the small screen,negative
at least there you dont have to pay to see her cleavage,negative
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless hate to burst your bubble but there are no fullfledged nude scenes in barb wire,negative
you wouldnt be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in,negative
i cant go back in time and reverse my mistake but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there,negative
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude its so quick you cant even tell for sure whether youre seeing her andersons or not,negative
a nipple hallucination sort of thing,negative
barb wire was adapted from a comic book interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life even wearing lowcut leather to do office work businesswoman bondage wear and having unreal body proportions,negative
yes like the mona lisa pamela anderson is a manmade beauty probably in more senses than one,negative
she is a definite beauty though and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience,negative
youd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldnt have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie because its obvious she wasnt pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills,negative
i mean she shows off more cleavage here than a jewelers convention,negative
the movie is set in the year 2017 the worst year of my life pam says,negative
the worst movie of the year i say,negative
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation silicone valley i think,negative
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute,negative
but dont call her babe,negative
she hates that and reminds us of that fact way too many times,negative
imagine a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist demeaning term,negative
a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldnt have to hear words like babe during a strip tease especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success,negative
the plot haha revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorates retina scanners,negative
in the words of one of the characters theyre more than meets the eye,negative
reminds me of the transformers cartoon and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent but that never happened,negative
no the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela vandamme bigbusted kickboxer and her resistance accomplices exboyfriend axel tamuera morrison and cora victoria rowell,negative
thank god they didnt name her cora reef,negative
one bad character name is more than enough,negative
pamela originally doesnt take sides giving some speech about shes only loyal to the money they pay her but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother jack noseworthy of bon jovi always video fame,negative
i still dont know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy but he definitely is nose worthy even if he isnt sponge worthy,negative
pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semiautomatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest,negative
its not rambo,negative
its bimbo,negative
mark my words barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year,negative
its got all the elements of the directtovideo releases featured on hbos bastard cousin the cable channel id never watch if it didnt somehow come free,negative
its got the nontitillating scenes of voyeurism laughable flashbacks bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo,negative
theres even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movies premise while the words scroll up the screen,negative
someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this aint star wars,negative
if youve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years youll recognize plenty of lifted elements,negative
barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over car crashes explosions broken glass and slowmotion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death,negative
this is one of those automaticpilot movies anyone could write or direct,negative
barb wire has only two things going for it,negative
and i think you know what those two things are,negative
the premise of this movie is well pretty farfetched,negative
tom berenger plays shale a mercenary who is temporarily out of work those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba,negative
fortunately his girl friend diane venora a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher,negative
not telling his girl friend who might object on pedagogical grounds he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself from yale harvard princeton et al and begins his tenure as a high school teacher,negative
the students junkies drug dealers gang members sleazy sluts icepick wielders you,negative
get the picture dont really take to him right away so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers,negative
this gets their attention to a certain extent so he tells them the story of the vietnam war see some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south,negative
oh yeah now they can dig it the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before,negative
but wait,negative
there are drugs being dealt in the school itself,negative
and behind the whole scheme in cahoots with the head gang the kod no not cod but knights of destruction really is none other than the,negative
upright excop principal played by the forgotten ghostbuster ernie hudson,negative
so shale does what any good teacher would do,negative
he gets his buddies together they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons explosives and cool stuff like that and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school,negative
ok so the premise is not just farfetched its downright dumb,negative
if this were a hong kong action comedy we might just accept it but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun,negative
oh it has its moments how one can truly hate a movie in which huge really huge amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses,negative
and to be fair it is almost never really boring as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story,negative
but over all this is pretty much a madefortv movie with more and bigger explosions and more foul language,negative
in fact it reminded me of miami vice without the production values babes in skimpy bikinis and pastels,negative
if you can sneak into the theater without paying go for it,negative
otherwise wait for video,negative
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
plot a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients,negative
of course the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands before they kill his daughter,negative
pretty good premise no,negative
critique if youre not a fan of movies packed with plot holes inconsistencies and yes even more plot holes heed my words and skip this hollow thriller,negative
and i dont like saying that either since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well,negative
sure the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom primal fear and nick of time pureed into one but the whole psychiatrist working against the clock thing actually had me engaged at first,negative
but its at about the halfway mark of this movie that the bottom drops out and all that were left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers,negative
we get the overly smart kid who manages to pull one over on the bad guys,negative
we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy,negative
we get douglas character a new york uppedity psychiatrist suddenly turning into an action hero with moves and attitude to boot,negative
and what about the films main plot point,negative
why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years and even more so why would they only give the shrink until the days end to do his part,negative
you waited 10 years whats another few days or why not set up another heist instead,negative
ill tell you why its because we wouldnt have a bad movie otherwise thats why,negative
and many many more,negative
ugh whatever the case it was just about the time that douglas character suddenly removed murphys character from the mental home and how come she went with him so nicely,negative
i thought she didnt trust him that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke,negative
and a few bogus chase and action sequences later we were left with a longwinded ending that did little to answer any other questions i mightve still had and actually brought up even more contradictions,negative
badly put together this movie features some decent acting some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone,negative
in fact if it wasnt for brittany murphys excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen jennifer espositos embarrassing performance as a police woman yeah right,negative
watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick but it wasnt supposed to be and michael douglas cool regular guy part there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture,negative
incidentally can anyone please give me one good reason why espositos character was in this movie in the first place,negative
she was completely superfluous,negative
and on top of all that by the end of this flick the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that hed been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier characters death when one of the bad guys dies just so we know as an audience that the two are interrelated somehow,negative
ooooh thanks mr fleder i,negative
appreciate the spoonfeeding dude yum,negative
yum but,negative
how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense,negative
whatever,negative
either way i dont give a rats ass because this movie is a dog and thats unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it,negative
see it if you like dumb thrillers,negative
incidentally if you appreciated along came a spider you will likely enjoy this film as well,negative
they both start off with interesting premises only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
along came a spider 410 girl interrupted 510 kiss the girls 710 primal fear 710 seven 1010,negative
if youve seen the trailers or commercials its rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store,negative
well its hard to tell after watching the movie as well,negative
bruce willis is a resident of the future and it is a rather bleak future,negative
the worlds population had disintigrated into a mere 200 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals,negative
the reason,negative
in 1995 an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus thus wiping out practically the worlds population in a mere month,negative
bruce willis character is one of the surviving few but is enslaved by scientists as are most of last living humans,negative
they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task go into the past find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys and kill him,negative
well this explanation didnt come easy,negative
although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people our future and the evilo in the world as a story it is very confusing,negative
and dragging,negative
i know a movie isnt keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that its only been an hour passed,negative
terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate and i havent watched his previous work brazil but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out you wish it were more complex and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me,negative
director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film the dreadful comedy steal big steal little was funny,negative
keanu id rather play music than play another action hero reeves is the grad student on the run who along with his superfluous sidekick rachel weisz has been framed for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks,negative
the mushroomcloud explosion is a knockout and easily the best part of the movie,negative
or as one audience member succinctly summed it up whoa,negative
false information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run fleeing over open drawbridges across icy lakes and through the corridors of power at a topsecret underground energy facility,negative
aiding and abetting is the teams shady mentor played in an excellentbutso what performance by morgan freeman,negative
brit brian cox is also about as the behindthescenes bad guy,negative
he has some fun fiddling with a southern accent,negative
unfunny overscored and without a single shred of suspense chain reaction is the summer movie to walk out on,negative
if you make it to the end a mess of crosscutting involving another imminent explosion youll hear somebody say i guess its time to go,negative
heed that warning,negative
ok i admit iti find camp amusement with the spice girls,negative
yes the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual identities they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of girl power,negative
but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isnt enough to carry their big screen debut a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world,negative
the film begins amusingly enough with a cheeky 007esque title sequence in which the british quintet scary melanie brown baby emma bunton sporty melanie chisolm ginger geri halliwell and posh victoria adams are introduced one by one to much to my surprise excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience as they croon the silky ballad too much a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film,negative
a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film 1 the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at londons royal albert hall 2 a film producer george wendt and a screenwriter mark mckinney pitch various film ideas to the girls manager clifford richard e grant 3 a documentary film crew follows the girls 4 a pregnant mate naoki mori of the group rapidly approaches her due date and 5 a tabloid publisher barry humphries attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug richard obrien,negative
capped off by a live rendition of the girls bouncy hit say youll be there a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow right,negative
wrong its all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches,negative
i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them much less a organized framework for all the wacky goingson,negative
spice world jumps from vignette to vignette subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense at one minute having the girls meet with aliens no joke and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride,negative
while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and thereduring a dance bootcamp scene the girls sing the lyric we know how we got this and courage and a wonderbra much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level,negative
some gags are just plain pointless such as roger moores recurring role as the mysterious chief who dispenses cryptic metaphorheavy advice to clifford,negative
the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond,negative
ha ha,negative
as weak as the script is i think theres one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie and that is the girls themselves,negative
the point is not that they cant act and for the record they really cant but that their individual personas which works as a gimmick over the span of a fourminute music video are too thin to survive outside of the truncated video bite mtv world,negative
posh who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions comes off best by default because her persona rich bitch most easily translates into character in a film,negative
babys persona young innocent to a lesser extent also works but the remaining girls identities are a little harder to flesh out,negative
there really isnt much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often which is exactly what fuller and spiers do and after all what exactly entails being ginger or scary,negative
apparently just their wardrobes,negative
spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices signature hit wannabe,negative
the song is as grating as ever but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a muchneeded shot in the arm setting the stage for a wave of selfreferential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas the film almost mirrors robert altmans the player in the way the film snails into itself,negative
this section of the film involving all manner of derringdo involving a speeding bus is perhaps its most effective but it also points up how all the other storylines the publisher the documentary crew lack a satisfactory payoff,negative
spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family and it will please the spice faithful,negative
but this sloppy enterprise surely wont win them any new fans which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states,negative
once the hype disappears spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america,negative
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here,negative
wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence,negative
billy zane is wooden as the hero,negative
kristy swanson is given very little to do and does very little with it,negative
treat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie,negative
only catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance,negative
she has energy and spunk which the movie needed much more of,negative
oh yeah the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you wont even care,negative
about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones and some colorful scenery,negative
however if youre looking for a fun family movie go watch the underrated flipper,negative
this is not a good movie,negative
susan grangers review of jeepers creepers entertainment,negative
this nasty little horror film begins as a bickering brother justin long and sister gina philips are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrappedup bodies down a drainage pipe,negative
when long decides to investigate theres nothing but trouble,negative
you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it,negative
well this is it,negative
philips warns,negative
what he finds in the basement of an old abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying jaggedstitched incision from his neck to his navel plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry,negative
long flees but now the monstrous winged creeper jonathan breck is after both of them,negative
eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle a psychic who explains the evil creatures bizarre feeding habits,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 jeepers creepers is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion giving new meaning to the old song jeepers creepers,negative
and now as paul harvey would say for the rest of the story,negative
whats more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 yearold actor in california,negative
sentenced to three years in prison he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992,negative
when salva made powder 1995 the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile,negative
and now once again in this film that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio,negative
in the year 2029 captain leo davidson mark wahlberg boogie nights is training his chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station,negative
when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles pod is lost davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the planet of the apes,negative
maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr cast away and lawrence konner mark d rosenthal mighty joe young,negative
director tim burtons unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly pointless remake,negative
davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror whom he wisely joins,negative
however hes rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo paul giamatti duets,negative
ari helena bonham carter fight club daughter of the illustrious senator sandar david warner titanic and simian bleeding heart believes humans should live with apes on equal standing an unpopular notion,negative
she takes a liking to leo who she deems unusual,negative
general thade tim roth lucky numbers is of the opposite opinion wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race,negative
hes sweet on ari,negative
its relatively easy to see where this new story is going from the onset yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes,negative
the much ballyhooed surprise ending is a nonsensical let down,negative
an attempt at a love triangle conveyed by ari and the human daena estella warren driven giving each other back off looks over leo fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them,negative
the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado glenn shadix and his trophy wife nova burtons squeeze lisa marie,negative
guffaws will also likely greet charlton hestons cameo as thades father the one ape harboring a firearm who sputters some very familiar lines before dying,negative
the only real success of the 2001 planet of the apes is rick bakers makeup and even thats an iffy affair,negative
no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors eyes a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work,negative
roth warner and michael clarke duncan as thades right hand man attar are given the most impressive makeovers,negative
giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal,negative
tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about most spectacularly when mounting his steed but evens hes undone by some obvious wire work,negative
bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing,negative
most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover,negative
the apes city resembles a dank complex of tree houses,negative
the apes military costumes colleen atwood sleepy hollow as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishiokas work on coppolas dracula,negative
that oriental flavor is also found in danny elfmans tribal percussive score,negative
planet of the apes was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 a dismal movie season thats going to the dogs,negative
a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film ive ever reviewed on paper,negative
i didnt know at the time that id soon encounter and despise batman robin which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer,negative
as directed by joel schumacher who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isnt very good at either b r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion,negative
the plot which has mr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman planning to take over gotham city and then the vorld as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust partnership blah blah blah,negative
but morals are not the point of this filmtopping each bloated confusing action scene with next one is,negative
the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls,negative
since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel,negative
only george clooney comes out on top he underplays nicely and pretends like hes in a real movie,negative
deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie,negative
this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises and being true to its title being deceptive,negative
but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit,negative
braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute renee zellweger,negative
their lone suspect is wayland tim roth a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hookers pocket,negative
however a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables,negative
braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives,negative
braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ellen burstyn a local bookie,negative
kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite rosanna arquette believing his wife to be unfaithful,negative
the plot is twisty and complex with lots of lengthy flashbacks and plenty of surprises,negative
however there are times when it is needlessly complex and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost,negative
take a look at l a confidential or the films more likely inspiration the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled,negative
the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot,negative
for example the film tells a few substories such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable,negative
theres never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation,negative
they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay,negative
the characters themselves are rather pathetic and despicable,negative
not one of them is an ounce sympathetic and as a result the labyrinthine plot is all for naught,negative
what does it matter who is guilty of what and why,negative
writerdirectors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers masterwork blood simple or the wachowski brothers less worthy bound,negative
but while they have got the plot twists down cold they need to work on characterization and dialogue,negative
sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime but this has got to be one of the worst,negative
a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting the specialist is about as exciting as an episode of dragnet and about as well acted,negative
even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script stupid and unlikable characters and just plain nothingness,negative
who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anticlimactic,negative
unless you saw blown away,negative
the specliast of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone in comeback 19 i think who plays a quiet hermitlike bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant james woods who shows us exactly what overthetop is other than another bad sly film accidentally killed some innocent people during a job,negative
his credo is killing bad people not innocents,negative
and thats why he makes big bombs,negative
so anyway into his life steps the seductive sharon stone who is basically the of the stupid son eric roberts of a kingpin rod steiger in an indecipherable accent which is sometimes cuban sometimes brando sometimes scottish etc,negative
turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him since he killed her parents when she was young,negative
so she calls sly leaves messages with him sends him email etc about planting a bomb to kill roberts which sly listens to obsessively and while he works out naked,negative
yea,negative
also into his life though again comes woods who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly,negative
using the cops he tries to set up traps none which really work so when sly calls him he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone getting so worked up by saying his mustbeimprovised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open,negative
these are the most exciting scenes in the film and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film,negative
the film tries to offer us a moody film noir except with explosions but comes up completely snakeeyes,negative
its just a pretend film noir making it a big waste of time,negative
and for action buffs the action scenes are pretty lame with some really unrealisticlooking special effects a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub,negative
then theres the muchdiscussed sex scene between sly and stone which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on friends,negative
their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy because it shows us more of sly than stone,negative
now lets guess who wed rather see naked okay,negative
stones small but perky breasts which weve seen more times than harvey keitels dick or stallones veiny ass which isnt usually shown for a very good reason,negative
i know i cant really judge it as a flaw of the film but come on,negative
the worst flaw of the film is this its boring,negative
i mean i was on caffeine when watching it but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting,negative
but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make,negative
if youre in for some fun action rent slys earlier demolition man which sucks too but in a much more entertaining fashion,negative
skip this dull film unless you want to see woods or make fun of steigers accent or see stones breasts again,negative
jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities,negative
chan plays separatedatbirths boomer and john ma whose drastically different paths,negative
aw forget the plot description its not even worth the space,negative
but lets face it,negative
no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway,negative
the scenes where nothing happens in chans films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together,negative
in the case of twin dragons however the tiresome plotdriving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema get to the good part already,negative
most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers efforts to hide the others existence from their own acquaintances,negative
why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot,negative
the twins love interests demure clubsinger barbara chanfilm regular maggie cheung and lusty bridehopeful tammy nina li chi get disoriented in all the brouhaha yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with,negative
the scenes describing the boys bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot in several shots in fact even the makeup and hair people seem to forget which brother is which,negative
even chans socornyitsfunny humor is offkilter in this outing,negative
some of the gags are so carefully innocuous theyre annoying,negative
a case in point whenever anyone sees the brothers together they fall to the ground in a dead faint,negative
are we laughing yet,negative
as usual the final showdown is the films jewel a tour de force display of chan s agility and grace,negative
never mind that its not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crashtesting facility,negative
its all good fun but too little too late,negative
perhaps chans next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies,negative
they could call it jackie chans the final fight scenes and everybody would go home happy,negative
reviewed april 14 1999 at loews theaters white marsh white marsh md,negative
some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time,negative
playing god asks just one simple eensy teensy thing so it can fully entertain you its accomplished in just four easy to follow steps crack open your skull scoop out your brain squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one,negative
congratulations you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing,negative
some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie others are simply good ideas that are badly executed,negative
then theres playing god which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of ripoffs or homages as they like to call it from other better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet,negative
harsh maybe,negative
justified,negative
hell yes,negative
this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes,negative
for example a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away,negative
this does look moderately kool but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling oooh look look,negative
john woo,negative
two guns blazing,negative
slooooow motion,negative
and if that wasnt enough you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie,negative
poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines you have to admire the effort he puts into it this guy deserves better,negative
unlike most movies this one does not suffer from stupid bad guy syndrome just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes,negative
example duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages,negative
now the bad guy is like stoned man so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero,negative
term used as loosely as possible,negative
survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun which our hero does but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds,negative
even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger,negative
mind you ive never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs be he stoned or not,negative
some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct the hell with that,negative
two fbi guys have just been shot in front me along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second,negative
solution,negative
boom,negative
ill take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much,negative
another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome,negative
our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her,negative
he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers,negative
he still has his shotgun bring it along you say,negative
no thanks ill just ditch it in the back of my car,negative
and the real kicker is this when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised,negative
while we are on the subject of getting shot why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door,negative
ive got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door,negative
ask mr wild bill the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life,negative
this is the major problem with this movie any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better,negative
is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters,negative
for instance,negative
our heroes hide at duchovnys summer home now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment,negative
ok this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time,negative
but see our hero is a drug addict and guess what,negative
he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt,negative
oh sure hell be really impressive when the bad guys come calling,negative
going clean is really honorable of him but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun,negative
for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton plot holes the size of godzilla getting our intelligence insulted and several oh come on,negative
moments,negative
wolfgang petersens latest the perfect storm is like a pineapple,negative
it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging if you try to eat the fruit spikes and all its going to hurt quite a bit,negative
ok maybe that was a confusing analogy so heres my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick there isnt really much of a story to tell,negative
basically a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat called the andrea gail and gets stuck in the middle of the storm of the century,negative
how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story,negative
not nearly enough,negative
so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous,negative
audiences want to see the storm they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched maudlin drivel,negative
the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect but just try lasting the first threequarters,negative
i have yet to read sebastian jungers the perfect storm but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale,negative
based on a true story the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version the approach is weak,negative
using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner petersen almost hides the inyourface banality,negative
right away the central characters are introduced the gritty determined captain george clooney the ingenue mark wahlberg torn between his job and his girlfriend diane lane the loving father john c reilly the comic relief whos always trying to get laid john hawkes the new guy william fichtner who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet french guy allen payne,negative
so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer,negative
it is not the allstar casts fault just the characters designed for their portrayal,negative
allen paynes character never speaks in the entire movie not because he is mute but because hes never given any lines,negative
are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with,negative
fichtners character is terribly underdeveloped we dont know what hes doing there where hes from or who hes supposed to be,negative
the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene you know what would look good on you,negative
me,negative
ooooh real creative,negative
as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters the crew continues to not feel human,negative
only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk,negative
the computergenerated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real,negative
i can only imagine if this was an imax film this city kid would surely never go in the water again,negative
this is loud jolting entertainment adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film,negative
the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment,negative
the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so,negative
i guess ill stick to that other survival spectacle you know the one on cbs,negative
im going to start this review off with a hypothetical question,negative
lets say youve just been in a car accident and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious,negative
your friends have left to go get help and youre waiting to see if the victim wakes up,negative
a towtruck comes along and the driver hops out of the truck to see whats going on,negative
he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck,negative
do you,negative
a run away screaming for your life staying away from the main road,negative
b run away but not too fast and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you stop to catch your breath try to negotiate with the psycho and when that fails start running away again all the while staying on the main road,negative
if you answered a you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of texas chainsaw massacre the next generation and will likely hate this movie,negative
however if you answered b prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind,negative
texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is being called a sequel but its really more of a remake of the original,negative
theres a few changes here and there but its essentially the same even the infamous meathook scene has been recreated,negative
the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere,negative
needless to say they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family,negative
much carnage ensues,negative
to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly,negative
in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere,negative
it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel,negative
no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why is going around killing people with the planes wheel,negative
the dialogue is even more atrocious,negative
zellwegger who is kidnapped by the family early on keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people,negative
when youre surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses i would think that rationality would go out the window,negative
speaking of going out the window there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window,negative
apparently the stunt double had a little trouble because she visibly gets stuck in the window,negative
the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double doesnt get caught in the window,negative
this was one of many glaring inconsistencies,negative
there are so many in fact that if i were to name them all this review would be several pages long,negative
the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey,negative
he plays a member of the family with a hydraulic leg homemade i might add and is so completely overthetop you cant help but be amazed by his performance,negative
he obviously had a lot of fun with this part and it really shows,negative
he makes jack nicholsons portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in the shining look restrained in comparison,negative
for a horror movie texas chainsaw massacre the next generation contains surprisingly little gore,negative
in fact in contains none,negative
theres a little blood here and there but thats as far as it goes,negative
which leads me to believe that the budget must have been astonishingly low and it shows,negative
everything about the movie looks cheap from the sets to the costumes,negative
especially leatherface,negative
once frightening and nightmare inducing hes now as terrifying as dame edna,negative
do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake,negative
check out the far superior original instead,negative
a documentary from the twin hughes brothers allen and albert dead presidents menace ii society about street pimps all of whom are africanamerican,negative
an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession,negative
it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their hos and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be is what you get,negative
i learned that the word bitch is their favorite word as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used,negative
it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about then some of what they rap about might seem amusing,negative
they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money,negative
its also a power trip accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place,negative
this sleazy pic soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears,negative
these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face,negative
the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models the featherhatted furcoated diamond ringwearing gold chain wearing flashy cadillaccruising pimp of the late 70s blaxploitation movieslike the mack and willie dynamite,negative
also used as reference was iceberg slims bestseller pimp the story of my life,negative
we meet pimps such as fillmore slim cnote charm kred gorgeous dre bishop don magic juan and rosebudd,negative
they readily discuss their business arrangements including percentages lifestyles knockin stealing another pimps ho and the thrill they get from women giving them money,negative
these dudes needed no prompting to talk as they just love to brag about about themselves,negative
priests need nuns yaps cnote a san francisco pimp,negative
doctors need nurses,negative
so hos need pimps,negative
as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make that the girls need them to show them the ropes how to make money to be their security blankets protectors and counselors,negative
the race issue was brought up right from the films onset as a number of white interviewees regular citizens note that their impression of a pimp is that hes the lowest form of human,negative
while we are told in the black community the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur riding around in fancy cars flashing wads of money dressed in a flamboyant style where his snakegaiter shoes might cost him a grand and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community,negative
we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery of master and slave relations,negative
the film was all about pimp style and their projected image as they run a hardsell riff about the virtues of their work,negative
there are different styles of pimping but the film mentions them only as being macks and players or real pimps and perpetrator pimps but no further clarity is attempted,negative
it is also failed to get the womens side to this story of abuse primarily taking the pimp at his word,negative
the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing hungry for their 15minutes of fame,negative
the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to,negative
danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimps wardrobe,negative
while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd married his ho and turned square working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer,negative
everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap from the roger cormangrade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi the undiscovered country,negative
but pillers notquitehalfbaked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrections failure,negative
im about to give the same advice to rick berman and co,negative
as ive given to the financiers of james bond movies its time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director,negative
while were at it put that visor back on laforge,negative
for three hundred years the baku species who look just like humans have lived on a ringedplanet that might as well be called the fountain of youth,negative
six hundred of them occupy the briar patch the area affected by metaphasic radition a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly,negative
but evil ruafo this is probably abrahams last stop before performing amadeus at a dinner theatre near you leader of the sona who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery wants to relocate the baku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place in order to replenish his dying breed,negative
the federation is all for this but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive to not interfere with the development of an alien race,negative
never mind that the baku didnt exactly evolvethey went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world,negative
every time frakes gives an interview lately he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment,negative
he has called it a comedy a thinking mans picture a throwback to the old series and most grievously he has likened it to a john ford western,negative
i presume thats some john ford he went to school with not the director of the searchers,negative
he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version,negative
thats no excusesomeone generated this footage,negative
muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems star trek insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia,negative
consider such curiosities,negative
picards love interest anij donna murphy can slow things down by staring at them such as a waterfall or falling rocks her scientific explanation for this,negative
dont ask,negative
worf gets a pimple hes reexperiencing klingon puberty thanks to the timedefying atmosphere laforge regains his eyesight trust me levar burtons real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact and troi brags about her firm boobs but picard remains as bald as an androids butt,negative
most suspiciously what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun,negative
the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts and they also turn ruafo into a completely powermad superfreak just so the characters will have something to do in the climax,negative
and if youve seen return of the jedi youve seen the ending of this movie,negative
didnt picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions,negative
frakes lucked out with first contact and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection he has no sense of comic timing and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists,negative
take a look at the painful troi gets drunk scene in fc and youll get the general idea of insurrections unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone,negative
even the worst shatner and co,negative
treks like the final frontier maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless charming comaraderie between kirk spock and bones,negative
neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher gates mcfadden whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique troi or laforge,negative
and all three next generation films spend too much time on data who is the franchises answer to urkel,negative
need a cheap laugh,negative
have data say something sexual or start singing or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if its the hunk of styrofoam it really is,negative
heres my proposed title for number 10 data star data trek data data data data data,negative
in this movie data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation,negative
star trek insurrection had one nice eerie silent moment that hints at a better darker film,negative
im not saying all of them should be star trek ii the wrath of khan but this one boldly went where no movie should go again,negative
who knew that in 16 years eddie murphy who made such a brash raucous bigscreen splash in 48hrs,negative
would become,negative
cuddly,negative
the disconcerting trend begun in this summers cutesy largely laughfree doctordolittle continues with this earnesttoafault dramedy,negative
although he is topbilled here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum who plays ricky hayman the programming director at a home shopping network,negative
sales are way down and rickys job hangs by a thread until he meets g murphy a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air,negative
while sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation the reinvigorated rickys greed grows endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant kelly preston,negative
writer tom schulman has some promising ideas satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity,negative
but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film,negative
the sluggishly paced holyman is not only slow and overlong 113 minutes but an unfunny bore and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings cleansed of both the attitude and comic sensibility that made him a star g is for the most part a straight man he is a curiously lifeless presence,negative
goldblum is actually quite good but its hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesnt seem to be much interested either,negative
in gia angelina jolie plays the titular character the first socalled supermodel,negative
and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome in my eyes anyway,negative
i just dont see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film,negative
despite this i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie,negative
sadly though my fears were realized,negative
its just not possible to make an interesting fulllength film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes,negative
the movie follows the rise and fall of gia no last name a tumultuous woman who doesnt particularly enjoy the world of fashion,negative
she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have,negative
the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high losing a job and going into rehab,negative
this formula is repeated several times and i really got tired of it,negative
in general i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use,negative
no because it offends me or anything like that it just bores me,negative
quite frankly i dont see the appeal so when a director shows me a pointofview shot of a junkie complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices i am left somewhat unimpressed,negative
the first hour of the film though was actually quite engaging,negative
we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend,negative
these early scenes were interesting,negative
were shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes and it was a perspective i hadnt seen before,negative
the movie begins to go downhill however once gia becomes an established model,negative
from that point i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end,negative
it all seemed so excessive,negative
fine so gia had a drug problem does this really need to dominate the film,negative
couldnt the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs,negative
or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world,negative
quite possibly although since i have no desire to become a model this warning is lost on me,negative
as i stated at the beginning of this review i simply dont see how the life of a model is worthy of a featurelength motion picture,negative
what do they do that warrants a movie,negative
strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour,negative
i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players for example but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life,negative
gia did not,negative
and by the end of the film all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling was bisexual and was heavily into drugs,negative
not exactly a meaningful contribution to society as far as im concerned,negative
spawn features good guys bad guys lots of fighting bloody violence a leatherclad machine gun chick gooey selfhealing bullet holes scatological humor and a maneating monster,negative
it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12 and 13yearold boys it appears to have been made by them,negative
in a classic example of telling and not showing spawn opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness forces of light and how men are the ones who create evil on earth,negative
so much for a message,negative
the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons michael jai white a government who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn martin sheen who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant,negative
simmons goes to hell and back after making a deal with satan himself if he agrees to command the devils army to overtake the world hell be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda underused theresa randle and little girl cyan sydni beaudoin,negative
of course seeing as how five years has passed wanda has fallen for and married simmons partner d b,negative
sweeney,negative
his uh shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown john leguizamo a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satans,negative
clown manipulates simmons now in superhuman spawn form into a stand off with wynn,negative
wynn who thinks he is in league with the doubledealing clown recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart when it stops beating major cities around the world will detonate causing the leak of a disease that makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash,negative
phew got all that,negative
it would be easy to dismiss spawn as just another one of those heavyonfx shortonsubstance action pics but it doesnt even work on that level,negative
the computergenerated sequences are often and plenty and the problem is that they look too computergenerated,negative
the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic with the movies healthy budget youd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks,negative
other elements of the movie are soso spawns enormous red flowing cape is a wonderful sight but its too obvious when hes being played by a costumed actor or an image,negative
in movies like contact the special effects serve the story,negative
in spawn they are the story,negative
and spawn himself isnt even an interesting character,negative
the films reliance on razzledazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for but both simmons and his funky alterego are completely underdeveloped,negative
what we need is a batman a luke skywalker,negative
even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn,negative
poor leguizamo,negative
he starred in februarys the pest a movie that i still think is the years worst so far although this one does give it a run for its money,negative
as clown he overacts to the extreme never missing an opportunity for a poortaste punchline,negative
leguizamo farts green mist munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a miniskirt and performs a cheerleader routine all before turning into a giant grey demon,negative
the guy was brilliant in to wong foo thanks for everything,negative
julie newmar,negative
what is he doing wasting his talent in this and the pest,negative
im one of the few people that liked batman robin this summers other bigbudget comic book film,negative
yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison i can only hope people will change their minds and think of batman as the superior adaptation,negative
theres a compelling story somewhere in spawn including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first africanamerican superhero ever but its just not found anywhere near here,negative
as it is spawn is just awful it stinks worse than a dead trout,negative
some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch,negative
then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone in the movie has turned off their brains,negative
the real mccoy is both,negative
its charmless molassesslow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta where the real mccoy is set might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation,negative
the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy kim basinger being arrested in the middle of a job,negative
six years later karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight,negative
she soon bumps into j t barker val kilmer a hapless wouldbe thief who idolizes karen,negative
j t also has ties to jack schmidt terence stamp the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him,negative
schmidt who is in cahoots with karens sleazy parole officer gailard sartain again wants karen to help him stage a robbery,negative
this time he has some leverage karens kidnapped son,negative
just when she thought she was out they keep pulling her back in,negative
contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them,negative
leading the list is the jack schmidt character who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins,negative
there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime let alone why he would actually participate in the breakin,negative
karens initial encounter with j t during a botched convenience store holdup also strains the limits of credibility,negative
it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point but instead they run into each other the next day because theyre leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment,negative
small world eh,negative
then theres the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape and pet tigers which through the power of the laws of bad cinema must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage,negative
however the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day,negative
but the fun doesnt end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne,negative
there is also the absence of a single solitary interesting character,negative
karen is earnest and singleminded in her motherly devotion but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material,negative
schmidt is a flaccid villain the parole officer is a complete blank and karens son and exhusband might as well be furniture,negative
only kilmers j t is remotely appealing but his one potentially intriguing quality his ineptitude is never developed,negative
in fact kilmer disappears during the middle of the film just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting subplot,negative
i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast,negative
various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever and some end with no reason evident why they didnt end up on the cutting room floor,negative
even the reasonably clever climactic breakin falls victim to this syndrome including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts i kid you not four minutes,negative
there is no tension in the scene just tedium,negative
russell mulcahy highlander is a director with some style and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good but he completely stumbles in the editing room,negative
there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that im tempted to overlook the little ones,negative
like karen disarming one of schmidts henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing,negative
like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later,negative
tempted but im pretty good at resisting temptation,negative
keep cool a chinese film directed by semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang was one of the kickoff films for this years hawaii international film festival,negative
on the day it premiered lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater,negative
they need not have wasted their time,negative
the movie is billed as a comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor,negative
there are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click,negative
i wondered if there were jokes that i wasnt getting because im not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldnt be attributed to the cultural barrier either,negative
keep cool just isnt very funny,negative
the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cools producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii,negative
although the print made it the assistants luggage was lost,negative
too bad that story wasnt in the movie because it got a big laugh,negative
qu ying the films female lead was also on hand to give a few comments,negative
however whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed ms ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fastpaced incredibly long tirade,negative
it was dizzying good foreshadowing for the film,negative
you see keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes,negative
at least thats the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving,negative
cinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another,negative
although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing i found it thoroughly distracting and after a while quite annoying,negative
headache as i said,negative
the film is about a young bookseller wen jiang who is after a young woman qu ying,negative
they used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship,negative
the first half of the film is about the young mans plan to win her back,negative
of course the thing is she doesnt want to be won back and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit,negative
in the fight the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost,negative
we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced,negative
there is a funny scene the only one in the film where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his losses,negative
there is no sense to be made out of the young womans behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character,negative
the bookseller would be better off without her,negative
although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owners hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man,negative
while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation,negative
his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time,negative
a friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate,negative
although only an hour and a half in length keep cool contains extraneous material,negative
the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we dont see her from the midpoint on,negative
a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the booksellers boring pursuit during the first half,negative
but of course this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour,negative
there are a few things that keep cool does right,negative
as mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good,negative
although it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations,negative
in one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different,negative
also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner,negative
the nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table,negative
with every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge,negative
unfortunately these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the films shortcomings and werent enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater,negative
in this years summer movie preview issue of entertainmentweekly theresa connelly described her writingdirecting debut polishwedding as a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would,negative
one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film a comedydrama that appears doomed at its most basic elements,negative
the family at the center of polishwedding is the pzoniaks which consists of mother jadzia lena olin father bolek gabriel byrne sole daughter hala claire danes and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness,negative
its a large family but theres not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch certainly not in the primary trio,negative
jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family but shes kind of a hypocrite since shes carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija,negative
her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration,negative
also how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy sexy jadzia,negative
hala is a spoiled selfcentered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy,negative
with such an unappealing set of characters its no surprise that polishweddings plot complications are far from involving,negative
naturally jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop russell schuster adam trese who fathered the child but he refuses to make such a commitment,negative
hohum,negative
another complication involving the decidedly unvirginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary is first played for laughs and then inexplicably as a profound statement in the films climaxwhich ironically is funnier than any of the films lame attempts at humor such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell,negative
that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly,negative
the jadziabolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers,negative
the halarussell conflict isnt resolved in as contrived a manner but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something,negative
and then theres some atrocious dialogue which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound look at all these pickles,negative
just looking at them gives me such great sadness,negative
as misguided as polishwedding is the affair is something of a letdown considering the strong performances by byrne danes and especially the fiery olin,negative
they obviously believed in connelly and her materiala faith that audiences will be hardpressed to share,negative
synopsis easilyangered chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce,negative
diedre easily cons davids notsobright new wife molly into believing shes a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and davids quicktempered son michael,negative
diedre at the same time murders a bunch of people,negative
comments the ex is a very bad movie,negative
i havent seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while,negative
i kept vacillating however between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ultimately i decided to split the difference and give it two stars,negative
as summarized briefly in the synopsis this is yet another spurnedpsycholovergetsherrevenge type movie,negative
im not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline but it seems like 10 000 000 000,negative
the ex however though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre differs slightly from the norm in that at least it doesnt take itself too seriously like so many other duds do malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind,negative
those involved in the movie realize theyre in a turkey apparently and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script,negative
the exs storyline as i said incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature however the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that after a while the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie,negative
diedre davids first wife kills and kills and kills for example without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like its not as though shes bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime,negative
david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael their son has emotional problems specifically his inability to control his anger,negative
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie the connection between him and his son is not made,negative
molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing shes a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son,negative
time and time again things do not add up in this movie,negative
if a viewer cant accept this fact then he will definately not like the ex,negative
if on the other hand he can appreciate the movie for its campiness then hell probably like it much better,negative
i dont mean to necessarily suggest however that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp,negative
even when viewed from an itssobaditsgood angle this movie isnt all that successful,negative
the ex does have its moments though almost all of which involve yancy butler the psychotic diedre and nick mancuso david,negative
these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which oftentimes elicit chuckles from the audience,negative
the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along,negative
butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue every time her character kills someone she has a punchline thats unbelievably inane,negative
when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david for example diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states im so sorry your lease is terminated,negative
or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene,negative
diedres therapist wishes to have her recommitted so she decides to visit diedre alone in her new apartment never realizing of course that its not hers,negative
therapists typically are catatonically braindead in these movies,negative
having successfully snuffed the woman out diedre looks at the body and says what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session dr jones,negative
oh thats right,negative
im sorry but your time is up,negative
this is what passes for humor in the film,negative
the audience doesnt necessarily laugh but groan the type of groan that suggests the audience cant believe theyre watching this crap although watching it they are,negative
nick mancusos chainsmoking nervouswreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butlers character delivers but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief,negative
in between drags off his cigarette for instance in one of the movies best scenes david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his exwife is,negative
in exaggerated exasperation he nearly shouts the woman is a cuckoobird,negative
trust me it is funny in context,negative
and so the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion,negative
i wont reveal the ending specifically though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film,negative
molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds,negative
molly at one point in the film notsobrilliantly observes after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her familys to spy upon them that shes crazy,negative
youd be pretty crazy too if youd rented this turkey,negative
id avoid it unless its on tv and you come across it,negative
if you do you may want to watch it groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot and feel good that you didnt spend money renting it,negative
everyone knows that old rule never work with children and animals,negative
in this latest horror flick mimic case its never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals instead as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience,negative
the film begins in new york where we see children dying from a mysterious disease which is being carried by cockroaches,negative
dr susan tyler sorvino creates a genetically enhanced bug the judas breed however which is designed to kill all cockroaches,negative
the bug does its job the cockroaches all die and the terror is gone,negative
three years later appears on the screen and we discover that the judas breed is back bigger than ever and ready to kill,negative
the spin on this bug however is that it can mimic its predator and in this case its,negative
humans,negative
that should teach us for squishing all those bugs,negative
what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace,negative
perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking and trying to avoid the predator type movie it could easily have become,negative
if it is then the director and writers have made the wrong move because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest,negative
the director who bought us cronos a far superior film directs the film in a calm and frankly dull movie,negative
there are few exciting sequences instead just a lot of people talking,negative
if the dialogue was intelligent then it would be all right but its sadly babbling nonsense,negative
in fact the script is embarrsingly weak and the characterizations not much better sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come with the script not bothering to develop them,negative
there is some action in this film but its directed in such an annoying way its just infuriating to watch,negative
the camera cuts all over the place disoreitating the audience and instead of involving the audience in the action it merely alienates them,negative
the peformances are o k if slightly below average,negative
sorvino is o k although shes not very good at conveying terror or anything emotion really,negative
the supporting cast are all sterotypes with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth a geeky scientist with spectacles and what could be the most stereotypical mexican old timer ever,negative
their reasonable good fun however,negative
mimic then may fail with its story pacing and characters but the film does look good,negative
like dark city mimic is a definite case of style of content,negative
it may be a bit too gloomy for its own good but the sets look nice and parts of the film are directed well,negative
but looks arent good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre somewhere where it shouldnt really belong,negative
a good opportunity then wasted,negative
a shame,negative
overall rating review by david wilcock 1998,negative
because no one demanded it david duchovny in a romantic comedy,negative
at last both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources,negative
the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot which could be fodder for a valentines day episode of the xfiles,negative
bob rueland david duchovny loses his wife elizabeth joely richardson in a car accident,negative
at the same time grace briggs minnie driver is in the hospital waiting for a heart transplant,negative
grace gets elizabeths heart and it leads her to bob,negative
its the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people,negative
four writers are credited with contributing to the story,negative
that doesnt seem possible,negative
despite being a solid two hours long return to me adds little to the boy meets girl boy loses girl formula and as a result is terribly tedious and slowmoving,negative
duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks and i kept wishing for a fastforward button to move their scenes along,negative
since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before i blame duchovny,negative
hes out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series and ive always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on the xfiles comes off more siblinglike than hotandbothered,negative
theres something about duchovny that makes me uneasy,negative
regardless of the role hes playing he comes off as a weirdo,negative
the only redeeming quality of return to me is its hilarious supporting cast,negative
the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker and they generate the only laughs in the movie,negative
carroll oconnor is graces grandfather marty oreilly,negative
when bob comes into martys restaurant after hours marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status,negative
when marty discovers that bob is a widower he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration this is bob,negative
his wife is dead,negative
the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news,negative
also funny bonnie hunt as graces best friend megan and james belushi as megans husband joe,negative
married with children megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance,negative
although its rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill,negative
rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bobs best friend and robert loggia as martys brotherinlaw angelo,negative
in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast,negative
bottom line if you are compelled to see this movie watch it on video so you can fastforward to scenes with carroll oconnor and james belushi,negative
libby parsons ashley judd has the perfect little life a rich husband a cute son and a house on the ocean but when her husband nick bruce greenwood takes her sailing she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood,negative
just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent,negative
shes convicted of his murder of course and leaves her son matty benjamin weir with her best friend annabeth gish,negative
time passes and the friend disappears with matty,negative
during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell daddy,negative
and realizes that her husband is still alive,negative
libby serves six years growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick based on the theory that because of the double jeopardy amendment she can off him with impunity,negative
when she gets parole shes sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman tommy lee jones a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident,negative
after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty,negative
travis pursues naturally,negative
double jeopardy is a watereddown version of the fugitive with jones sleepwalking through his wellworn pursuer persona,negative
although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train she manages to get into a few nailbiters chased down the beach by a jeep chained to a car that plunges into the ocean sealed in a coffin that add some much needed thrills to an anemic slowmoving script,negative
character development is thin,negative
travis intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story,negative
i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the doublejeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick,negative
its a long way to go for one line,negative
theres considerable sexual tension between travis and libby hey theres something the fugitive didnt have but it never goes anywhere,negative
libby is a tvmovie everywoman but judds intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics,negative
this is judds most prominent role to date and she proves that she can light up the screen,negative
lets hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around,negative
the quality of director bruce beresfords movies seems to depend on luck,negative
when he has a good script and a strong cast he turns out oscarcaliber work like breaker morant driving miss daisy and tender mercies,negative
when he doesnt,negative
we get double jeopardy,negative
screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on the rock a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites,negative
bottom line ashley judd tries hard but cant save this predictable bore,negative
when i originally saw the trailer for analyze this a few months ago i must admit i thought it looked kind of lame,negative
and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago i thought it looked outright bad,negative
but then when analyze this finally opened a few days ago an odd thing happened,negative
it got great reviews,negative
critics were proclaiming it hilarious and a deadon parody of mob movies,negative
well with praise like that i figured it must be good and so i headed off to the theater,negative
you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts,negative
well turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for,negative
analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted,negative
dont get me wrong i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here,negative
i think the problem is he didnt quite know how to approach this material,negative
he plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama,negative
if he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been a lot more successful,negative
as it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others,negative
this doesnt work,negative
it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know its him,negative
and the movie is badly paced too,negative
it never takes off,negative
it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum,negative
i think the blame for this should be placed on the script,negative
its obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist but once this is established the movie doesnt really go anywhere,negative
the formula of the film seems to be this billy crystal says no to deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues,negative
this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie,negative
ive said it before and ill say it again the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not its funny,negative
if analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting wouldnt have bothered me,negative
i would have been too busy laughing to notice,negative
but as it is i only chuckled a few times,negative
the only really funny scene is a deadon parody of the godfather,negative
sadly though i dont think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody because i was the only one laughing,negative
but my sense of humour i have come to realize is vastly different from the general population,negative
i loathed theres something about mary yet loved baseketball,negative
now if you want a movie that i think is funny go out and see office space,negative
its full of genuine laughs and wont leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes as analyze this did,negative
so i went and saw this film right it was called battlefield earth i was never interested in the previews and never too terribly interested in the book nor do i find scientology interesting but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is i had that weird urge just to watch it,negative
well let me be the first to say and so far in my view its safe to say battlefield earth might be the worst film i have ever seen yes even worse than mr magoo blue in the face or jaws the revenge,negative
roger christianson whos credits include set direction and art direction for such great films as alien and star wars directs this film with such amateurism that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb that its quite depressing,negative
the look of the film is dark and drabby at times but then bright and happy at other times,negative
the sound is terrible and has the worst surround sound effects ive heard,negative
the acting is nothing the dialogue poor and the makeup effects hideous,negative
heres the socalled plot earth 3000 man is a endangered species while aliens from the planet psychlo the aliens are named psychlo i,negative
wonder why are invading earth destined to put an end to those mananimals to an end and destroy earth once and for all of course we have our typical hero played terrible by barry pepper who was great in a small role in 1999s the green mile who is destined to go out and save his planet,negative
one thing he has to go up against terl the chief of security psychlo who is played frankly quite bad by john travolta whom with dreadlocks a big head and green eyes just doesnt work,negative
of course the sidekick to terl is played by lol,negative
forest whitaker who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind,negative
our friendly human johnny barry pepper looks just as bad as well with long scraggly hair,negative
im not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film except just to say its terrible,negative
everything in this film is imcomprehinsable from the makeup effects which by the way arent good to the phony looking special effects everything in this film is faulted,negative
in fact i dont remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time or enjoying myself,negative
in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed,negative
throughout the entire 127 minute running time i was dying constantly looking at my watch and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something sadly it didnt,negative
my advice to hollywood get new scripts new acting classes better directors and damnit make films like american beauty more,negative
ingredients possessed plastic dolls in love plastic dolls having sex,negative
starring jennifer tilly voice of brad dourif katherine heigl nick stabile john ritter,negative
synopsis this is the fourth film in the chucky series which debuted in the late 1980s,negative
basically chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer,negative
in bride of chucky chuckys longtime girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo,negative
dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans,negative
the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple so in the side plot the couple suspects each other of being a murderer,negative
opinion bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor but doesnt succeed,negative
somehow chucky moaning about mid life crisis and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky,negative
and tiffany harping about mid life crisis and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany,negative
the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tillys cleavage to keep attention during the first half and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half,negative
the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic,negative
starring arnold schwarzenegger danny devito emma thompson frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment and a big one at that,negative
junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman,negative
these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins,negative
so foolish me i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins,negative
so much for hopes,negative
schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists doctors hesse and arbogast who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy,negative
unfortunately due to circumstances beyond their control they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans and subsequently lose their funding,negative
still believing that their drug will work they decide to test it anyway on hesse,negative
so dr hesse schwarzenegger artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug,negative
their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying surely it will work on a woman,negative
does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you,negative
well it must have to the producers of junior,negative
admittedly schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off,negative
perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny,negative
but it wasnt schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best,negative
the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy and the accompanying emotional swings is not funny,negative
schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics,negative
i kept thinking to myself with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture,negative
better yet with schwarzenegger devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time why didnt they make a sequel to twins,negative
anything would have been better than this mess,negative
danny devito is wasted in this movie,negative
his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street,negative
after seeing the movie if i was devito i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street,negative
emma thompson is wasted here as well,negative
while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations she is also a fine comedian,negative
too bad she didnt get to use any of that talent here,negative
am i being too hard on this film,negative
i dont think so,negative
schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood,negative
with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film,negative
they certainly managed here,negative
maybe it was well intentioned but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made,negative
if you are tempted to see this film do yourself a favor and go rent twins a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devitos comedic talents,negative
the first species was a moderatelysuccessful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects a few well paced action sequences and frequent views of modelturnedactress natasha henstridge sans clothing,negative
however it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel,negative
and considering the quality of species 2 its obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead,negative
the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is,negative
if you throw away the plot which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence logic coherence and consistency species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience,negative
of course that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys who at least in theory shouldnt be able to get into an r rated film and connoisseurs of bad movies,negative
theres enough blood gore simulated sex and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring,negative
this is a grade z exploitation flick thats ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment,negative
somewhere someplace i recall hearing species 2 described as erotic,negative
i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie because he or she has a peculiar notion of eroticism,negative
sure theres a lot of sex and nudity but its almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a womans abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free splattering blood and gore in all directions,negative
anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater,negative
i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge and to get the obvious question out of the way yes she does remove her top but only once and only briefly,negative
although the character she played in the original species is dead government scientists still have the dna and out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse they decide to create another clone,negative
this creature dubbed eve by its creator dr laura baker played by marg helgenberger reprising her role is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile,negative
meanwhile man has finally set foot on mars,negative
a team of three led by patrick ross justin lazard has traveled to the red planet but when they return to earth they bring something with them,negative
ross has become a half alien hybrid and hes soon mating like crazy collecting the bloodsoaked children that are the result of each sex session,negative
his intention is obviously world domination,negative
standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film preston lennox michael madsen and one of patricks fellow astronauts dennis gamble mykelti williamson,negative
but when patrick learns about eve a female of his kind theres no damping his ardor,negative
im not sure what the budget for species 2 was but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors as opposed to being diverted into the special effects,negative
michael madsen and marg helgenberger both back for a second round are clearly on hand to do as little as they can grab the money and run,negative
ditto for james cromwell who plays patricks father underused is too kind a word to describe his involvement invisible would be more like it,negative
george dzundza gets to do a little scenery chewing as an angrybutinept general,negative
meanwhile justin lazards performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridges limited abilities look good by comparison,negative
the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick,negative
complete with cheesy special effects bare breasts around every narrative corner and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics,negative
director peter medak a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume has added another forgettable title but at least he appears to have had fun doing it which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness,negative
do i recommend the movie,negative
absolutely not but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didnt try my patience to the degree that some pseudointellectual bad movies do,negative
heres hoping theres no species 3,negative
a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets,negative
the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities,negative
the result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldnt build on to show them as the poets they were,negative
on paper this shouldnt have been so terrible it had a talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and a capable cast,negative
but the film was done in by its inept script the unappealing way the film was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud,negative
i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade,negative
he especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be,negative
but when the two of them were together it looked like a mismatch,negative
leonardos rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbauds poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring,negative
the film opens in postrevolutionary france in 1871 the 16yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems,negative
he accepts verlaines praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville,negative
once there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict with verlaines busty 18yearold wife mathilde romane and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her familys money even though he has nothing else in common with her,negative
when verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in a haughty tone only if theyre bad poets,negative
he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship,negative
verlaine proves to be weakwilled beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud,negative
when mathildes father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers,negative
its a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce,negative
in brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail,negative
while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19,negative
he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gunrunner and after ten years there comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37,negative
the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying,negative
the film ends on a whimper with,negative
verlaine talking with rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published,negative
this film was especially annoying because rimbauds poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry,negative
i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film but whatever it was it just didnt work,negative
it certainly didnt bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry,negative
ill bet right now youre just lounging by the pool humming i will always love you and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success,negative
it isnt necessarily over for you i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in kevin,negative
for at least a few more years,negative
begin by scribbling the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long somewhere youll always see it perhaps on the fridge door or on a bedroom mirror with lipstick,negative
you had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star in robin hood prince of thieves where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman and alan rickman but christian slater several dozen tall trees bows arrows and a canoe too,negative
after dances with wolves and jfk you decided the world needed more three hour movies expensive three hour movies so you starred in and produced wyatt earp wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a general lack of famous wyatts,negative
wyatt earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes,negative
tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend and that featured kurt russell as earp and dana delaney as his girlfriend,negative
she was played by joanna going in your movieyou know the character known best in wyatt earp as jew whore,negative
what were you and lawrence kasdan thinking,negative
now youre suffering the demise of yet another of your epics the postman a film so financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory waterworlds and tin cups mildly lucrative box office takes,negative
the postman is not the worst movie ever madepeople in hollywood are quick to forget movies like howard the duck whenever the next bomb comes along,negative
yet it is a ridiculous movie,negative
i suspect you thought you had another braveheart on your handswhy else line up two armies on horesback all prepared for battle for the climax of your film but,negative
mailheart the postman is not,negative
i can think of some more appropriate alternate titles post encounters of the worst kind farewell my salary howard the postman the postmans never watched twice,negative
what a brown movie,negative
i hate brown,negative
you love brown,negative
dances with wolves was golden and brownit looked like an eggo commercial,negative
the postman had me running for a glass of water every two minutes would the postapocalyptic world look this maddeningly bland and dry,negative
what exactly happened to this desert world anyway,negative
did we all become so stupid that we didnt immediately begin rebuilding homes restaurants and most importantly shopping malls after the war,negative
why did you choose to drive the movies plot with a dumb group of terrorists who well terrorize townfolk across america,negative
why is it only they have ammunition anyway,negative
was it really appropriate to cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you the driftercumpostman,negative
why cast english actress olivia williams as an american,negative
dont you realize that european women can only deliver their big emotional scenes in their native accent,negative
take a look at the lessthanstellar performances of an americanized nicole kidman or an americanized minnie driver,negative
who could give a damn whether you lived or died at the end of this movie,negative
if it came down to a fight for leadership between you and the leader of the terrorists why didnt you do that halfway through the film and save us all a lot of headaches,negative
why cast will patton as the bad guy,negative
because you worked with him in no way out,negative
sure hes a suitably creepy villain know why,negative
because hes creepy in everything including armageddon in which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his space suit,negative
why heroize the most demonic institution in america the u s postal system,negative
was tom petty supposed to be playing tom petty,negative
if so why didnt he look more skeletal,negative
he should have been around 70 years old,negative
why oh why do i have so many questions,negative
i could ask plenty more,negative
shouldnt a three hour running time have provided you enough space to answer everything,negative
you have one great line in this film and you deliver it to a mule,negative
the things i like about my ass,negative
i had to wonder,negative
actually i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes a relaxed cynicism if youll accept such clunky phrasingtoo bad you couldnt resist the temptation to film yet another love letter to your country,negative
ultimately im saying relax,negative
there is no quota no need for you to make a picture a year,negative
settle down,negative
really question future screenplays before you commit to them,negative
feel free to write back,negative
i know how much you like letters,negative
when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in jackie brown he immediately signed up for a little film called american perfekt,negative
this was almost two years ago,negative
i waited patiently for the film to be released but it never was,negative
finally i forgot about it,negative
the other day though while i was perusing the selection of the local video store i stumbled upon you guessed it american perfekt,negative
i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee rushed home to view it,negative
having now seen the film i understand why it never saw theatrical release,negative
american perfekt is a jumbled mess,negative
the storyline is nonexistent,negative
it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on,negative
and at that point the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was never going to introduce a plot of some sort,negative
it wants to get by on quirkyness and socalled charm alone and it just doesnt work,negative
robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer and they head off on the road together,negative
along the way to no discernable destination they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters,negative
i suppose this freewheeling no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment but all it did was make me sleepy,negative
im all for trying new things within the realm of film but not at the expense of coherence,negative
nothing in this movie makes sense,negative
the actions of the characters go unexplained even when theyre truly bizarre,negative
ill give you an example without giving too much away,negative
david thewlis has a part as a drifting conman,negative
at one point midway through the movie he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car,negative
as he passes them we see that his face is covered in blood,negative
do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him,negative
you would think so wouldnt you,negative
american perfekt is a waste of time,negative
nothing is gained from watching this movie except maybe a migraine,negative
and if you do rent it dont bother trying to figure out whats going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end,negative
this doesnt happen,negative
and no explanation is given for the misspelling of perfect either,negative
8mm is not going to enlighten your day,negative
its a dark grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence,negative
not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess youll require a lot of patience as well,negative
nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late,negative
he wore a bizarre getup and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality,negative
cage plays private investigator tom welles praised for his secrecy and reliability,negative
at home welles is a family man with a wife catherine keener and a small daughter to take care of,negative
his new assignment is a bizarre one the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husbands safe,negative
the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man until the girl is brutally murdered,negative
or so it seems,negative
welles of course begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth,negative
and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case the more he gets in over his head,negative
he hires an adult book store clerk named max california joaquin phoenix to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography,negative
max knows what welles is getting himself into and explains you dance with the devil the devil dont change,negative
the devil changes you,negative
these turn out to be very wise words,negative
8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution,negative
the setup is slick and well played as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her,negative
this is where everything goes awry,negative
although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the real world he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula,negative
everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects,negative
although it had enormous potential the third act of 8mm is a total bust leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control,negative
cage is the films sole flame of energy,negative
his performance is actually believable but soon the directors demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation,negative
still youve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand,negative
welles trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker played convincingly by peter stormare who is notorious for the hardesthitting snuff films in the industry,negative
this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killerlike phase in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film,negative
he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing chris bauer and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie,negative
written by andrew kevin walker 8mm dissipates into a poor mans seven with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece,negative
furthermore what has become of joel schumacher,negative
the director has recently experienced a major drought slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop batman and robin anyone,negative
this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side,negative
tristar rated r language sexual situations violence 87 minutes,negative
director and writer darren stein,negative
cast rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart judy greer julie benz chad christ ethan erickson carol kane pam grier tatyana m ali,negative
review by geoff berkshire,negative
jawbreaker is the very definition of a ripoff,negative
this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie 1976 heathers 1989 and clueless 1995 and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich s,negative
along the way darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own,negative
the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo judy greer about the four most popular girls at reagan high courtney shayne rose mcgowan who can basically be summed up as satan in heels julie freeman rebecca gayheart a good girl with the face of a supermodel marcie fox julie benz a dimwitted blonde who demands that people call her foxy and liz purr charlotte roldan an angel in disguise,negative
liz is everyones favorite because shes both beautiful and kind,negative
liz is about to turn 17 and as a prank courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning,negative
in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her,negative
they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtneys car but when they open it later polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment their lives will never be the same poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at lizs dead body,negative
courtney thinking fast decides to pass the death off as a and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her,negative
things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to,negative
in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into vylette hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students,negative
up until about this point the film is effective enough,negative
however an investigation begins into lizs death and the film becomes excessively dull,negative
the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch,negative
courtneys plan to frame a sleazy guy marilyn manson in a brief cameo is never believable for a second,negative
meanwhile the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot,negative
julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack chad christ,negative
he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid,negative
ferns rise to popularity is equally lame,negative
we do get the best scene in the film the only one with a spark of originality during this section,negative
its a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high schools resident jock stud dane ethan erickson to demonstrate using a popsicle exactly what he would like for her to do to him,negative
it at least provides us with a look at courtneys personality but the way the scene finishes doesnt make any sense,negative
stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting,negative
william katt and p j soles students in carrie are lizs distraught parents jeff conaway from grease 1978 is julies creepy single dad and carol kane the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls 1979 camps it up as principal miss sherman,negative
at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinemas greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer,negative
the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look,negative
the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid,negative
they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color,negative
director of photography amy vicent who beautifully lensed eves bayou 1997 does a remarkable job here as well,negative
shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive,negative
performances are mostly subpar with mcgowan providing only a few good moments compared with her excellent work in the doom generation 1995 and scream 1996 and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty,negative
none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of tatyana ali who has a small role as a cheerleader,negative
the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like auto stud college stud and high school stud 2,negative
the soundtrack is decent and imperial teens catchy yoo hoo makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film,negative
the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes with everything ranging from l a confidential to palmetto to the big lebowski has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran talented directors,negative
with this particular genre directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lowerclass and the glamorous opulent upperclass while maintaining the noirish ambiguous ambience the staple of film noir,negative
wild things could be classified as a black comedy a sultry film noir or a plain ol erotic thriller but the one category it doesnt qualify for is that of a quality motion picture,negative
overacted overwrought and overlong wild things is a confused mess a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too,negative
with its incalculable twists turns more twists and more turns it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness,negative
in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal wild things not once jells in its eroticism unpredictability character motivation sense of the world plot etc theres not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical,negative
directed by john mcnaughton henry portrait of a serial killer wild things follows sam lombardo matt dillon a hunkish suburban florida high school teacher whos the dream of every spruced up female in the community,negative
particularly one,negative
kelly van ryan denise richards adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner,negative
soon her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike enabling her to come into his house,negative
next thing she cries rape,negative
and the socalled rollercoaster ride ensues,negative
a second accuser comes front suzie toller neve campbell a boozedrinkin tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen,negative
even bill murray gets into the act as lombardos zany lawyer,negative
he wears a fake neck brace waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray,negative
you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role,negative
as ridiculous as it sounds hes the most sane character in the movie,negative
the community is astonished,negative
reporters flee to the scene,negative
theres an 8 5million settlement for a libel suit against kellys mother theresa russell,negative
theres the ambiguous cop kevin bacon who also executive produced who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit murder and lust,negative
we the audience sniff something not so lustful,negative
like so many thrillers these days including the usual suspects and the game wild things eschews character for plot,negative
mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease as if he knows the territory hes covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany henry a furious unsettling film directorial tour deforce,negative
george clintons score is a delight to behold,negative
but its the humans,negative
the characters are mere devices for the nasty twists,negative
what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving almost unbearable if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting dont feel real or we dont care for them,negative
not even the unintentionally funny moments work,negative
the people in wild things are not so much people as they are caricatures,negative
then theres the erotic content which nearly earned the film an nc17 for a sexless badly edited poorly lit menageatrois,negative
and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country kevin bacons member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go,negative
ironically the wildest elements of wild things are not wild at all,negative
there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director,negative
of course his best film was 1978s masterpiece halloween but he also made 1980s the fog and 1987s underrated prince of darkness,negative
heck he even made a good film in 1995 with in the mouth of madness,negative
but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 with the terrible comedy memoirs of an invisible man,negative
somehow carpenter has lost his touch with junk like his failed 1995 remake of village of the damned to his uninspired 1996 sequel escape from l a those movies however look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film john carpenters vampires,negative
if i was him i definately wouldnt want to put my own name in the title,negative
it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as vampires,negative
the story is simple,negative
jack crow james woods is a vampire hunter who along with one of his partners montoya daniel baldwin and a prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith,negative
since katrina was previously bitten by him crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her,negative
it seems valeks mission is to steal a black wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him,negative
my question is how many time have we seen this same story played out,negative
well the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made,negative
john carpenters vampires sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror films ive ever seen,negative
in fact there isnt even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105minute running time,negative
the nonstop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work which is usually a trademark of carpenters,negative
and then we come to the screenplay which as far as i can tell is nearly nonexistent,negative
there is no story development and there isnt even an attempt to flesh out the characters,negative
james woods can be a good actor but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of pseudo clever lines of dialogue,negative
daniel baldwin has some potential but his character comes off as being very dense,negative
and sheryl lee faring much better as laura palmer in twin peaks like all of the female characters plays an offensive stereotypical whore,negative
there is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenters vamires which is very disheartening coming from an exfan of carpenters,negative
he has said that he turned down directing halloween h20 because he couldnt work up any excitement for it,negative
and yet when asked about a vampires sequel he said he would be happy to do it,negative
i think thats a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not to mention a significant number of iq points,negative
dear god this is a fantastically bad film,negative
regardless of what i say about knock off you cant grasp its awfulness from my words,negative
you have to see it and experience it for yourself,negative
heres the kicker though i suggest that you do so,negative
yes this is a bad film easily one of the most incompetent films of the year but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure,negative
in fact i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story,negative
dont get me wrong im not excusing knock off,negative
it reaches an unacceptable level of badness its so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was,negative
it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino and of course jeanclaude van damme,negative
it does however have the entertaining presence of rob schneider and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark,negative
as i watched it i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness,negative
now in retrospect it seems clear that it wasnt but its still a fascinating kind of mess,negative
i dont like writing plot descriptions it is by far the most boring part of writing a review but in this case im off the hook there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off,negative
for the sake of comparison i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing,negative
i paid closer attention to knock off and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray and is accused by the cia i think of selling knock off products knock off products are of course products that look like namebrand materials but are generic and cheap,negative
i dont know what any of this has to do with martial arts but there are lots of martial arts in the film,negative
ray is good at martial arts so when he has to beat up bad guys theres no problem,negative
rob schneider plays his sidekick although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film,negative
lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once,negative
in fact every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do,negative
in that order knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense,negative
but what a strange mess it is,negative
it was written by stephen e de souza who also wrote die hard and 48 hours,negative
can this be the same man,negative
i dont see how unless of course huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time,negative
knock off seems to have an interesting premise as far as action films go but theres no semblance here,negative
for instance van damme is introduced and then seconds later hes running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong,negative
why,negative
who knows,negative
what are the implications of this,negative
i have no idea,negative
most action films abandon depth in favor of action and this is normally a problem,negative
knock off however is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut,negative
the acting is embarrassingly bad rochon in particular delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity,negative
sorvino in addition deserves better than this,negative
van damme is bad but hes charming in that bad way and so i cant say that hes hard to watch although i rarely understood what he was saying,negative
the only exception is rob schneider who is actually quite funny a lot of the time,negative
tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison,negative
theyre all pointless gimmicks though such as shots of the innerworkings of a knock off running shoe,negative
but his action scenes are never boring one particular piece inside of a fruit factory a fruit factory is wellchoreographed,negative
lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy such as our heroes first encounter with the rochon character,negative
but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous,negative
i hope he did for the alternative is a frightening thought,negative
knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania,negative
if it were boring id give it zero stars,negative
but its not boring its loud and excessive and completely incoherent,negative
its also funny even when it isnt meaning to be funny,negative
a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesnt deserve to be fully lambasted,negative
i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness but i cant deny its zany useless charm,negative
oh i know theyre just action scenes looking desperately for a real story but theyre fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts,negative
its fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this but that doesnt excuse the fact that it is indeed awful,negative
im not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream but im guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft,negative
seriously this ideaa psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legendsis a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off,negative
the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue,negative
an example that car crash mustve been awful for,negative
everyone involved,negative
you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said just no one figured out what,negative
i know in slasher movies there isnt supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself dont mind cardboard cutouts but please dont let the cutouts be so damn bland,negative
one reason movies like scream star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters,negative
aside from jared leto and joshua jackson who arent on the screen long enough no one in urban legend makes the grade,negative
alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive not to mention as dumb as a post through 34 of the film and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot,negative
good thing brad dourif is here but wait hes only in the movie for five minutes and hes just redoing his goodnatured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoos nest,negative
which brings me to another aspect of urban legend its unoriginality,negative
the film most blatantly ripped off is scream another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after cravens and williamsons great success,negative
urban legend tries to deconstruct modernday folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films but it doesnt quite succeed,negative
its best stab at selfreflexivity is poking fun at that girl in the noxzeema ad ie rebecca gayheart we also have another killertauntinghisvictimonthephone routine in urban legend and quick what movie is this exchange of dialogue from,negative
female protagonist why,negative
villain why,negative
why,negative
congratulations to those of you who answered scream urban legend,negative
like i said this movie couldve been great,negative
if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script,negative
still at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer,negative
this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film,negative
no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story,negative
however even if one thinks of it as fiction the prince of egypt remains shallow,negative
but ill begin from the beginning,negative
the biggest difference between the original biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero,negative
maybe its just me but if i knew i had god on my side id have a little bit more confidence,negative
there are other differences as well such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoahs death like its nothing but a thing,negative
most of all though the storys focus has shifted,negative
rather than being a story about fatherson manethnicity mangod the prince of egypt is almost solely about the brotherbrother relationship between rameses and moses,negative
i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie where it came off as maudlin,negative
rameses and moses squabble like children and then in the interests of peace moses saves rameses butt even though moses was the one who started it,negative
yawn i didnt care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer which of course never happened in the original story moses was exiled,negative
but enough about the differences,negative
lets talk about the movie itself,negative
it features a moses who in the interests of making the character more human lacks any divinity whatsoever which isnt convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is,negative
it features a cookiecutter iwannapleasedada rameses who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes from schindlers list among other things,negative
the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the newimproved miriam voiced by the everantsy sandra bullock even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason here bullock is replaced by a singing voice,negative
speaking of which it contains very annoying music,negative
it contains shallow writing,negative
it features extraordinary animation which is one good thing i can say about this film,negative
most of all it contains an attempt to commercialize homogenize and massmarket a story about a manifestation of god,negative
i am not christian but i got the impression of blasphemy,negative
the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chopchopped into the story,negative
american pie 2 is filled with laughs,negative
but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater,negative
im no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy,negative
but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself,negative
what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart,negative
of the original i noted it was a warm pleasant outing about the travails of growing up,negative
well the quartet of chums jim jason biggs oz chris klein kevin thomas ian nicholas and finch eddie kaye thomas have grown up,negative
at least they are a year older but dont seem any wiser,negative
fresh from their first year of college the quartet along with the obnoxious stifler seann william scott rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score,negative
as usual nothing goes right until the last reel,negative
but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women,negative
and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women,negative
for the most part they are not shown as individuals,negative
they are nothing more than potential recipients of overactive raging hormones,negative
it is telling that the most normal couple oz and heather mena suvari spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex shes overseas on an exchange student program,negative
despite having been to college jim is still klutzy and awkward unsure of himself around the opposite sex,negative
most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him including a painful episode involving an instant gluelike substance,negative
also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates whom the boys suspect of being lesbians,negative
it is offensive and plays upon outdated adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs,negative
the first film despite some raunchy moments had an innocent charm to it,negative
the sequel is more cynical,negative
it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them the many mentions of finchs encounter with stiflers mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levys return as jims wellmeaning tryingtobehip dad,negative
the only performer who is actually given some new fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle the band geek from the original,negative
in the sequel she imbues her character with vulnerability wisdom and maturity,negative
american pie 2 is a presold commodity that will earn several million at the box office,negative
it is a shame though that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz who also penned the original could not have set his sights higher,negative
american pie 2 is funny but its still a comedown as well as a letdown,negative
despite its exceedingly welldone visual effects 1995s original species was one big hunk of scifi cheese from the writing to the feeble performances,negative
so coming from such bgrade roots its sequels stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising yet at the same time it is,negative
it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad if not even worse,negative
something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in speciesa sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded hybrid silis never entered into perhaps that was left for species iiithough im not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own,negative
the alien fun and games begin this time when a threeperson astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain patrick ross justin lazard late of cbss shortlived soap of a few years back central park,negative
this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original films sil but its close enough and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find,negative
meanwhile scientist dr laura baker the returning marg helgenberger has created a clone of sil named eve natasha henstridge again for research purposes,negative
it doesnt take long for eve to sense another alien presence which send her libido into hyperdrive,negative
its up to laura and her former partner bounty hunter press lennox michael madsen another returnee and patricks uninfected shipmate dennis gamble mykelti williamson to find patrick before the inheat eve does,negative
this isnt the xfiles goddammit,negative
exclaims one character in the early going,negative
in terms of quality hes absolutely right but hes also wrong,negative
the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patricks pupils to dilate once hes infected,negative
looks and sounds an awful lot like the xfiless black cancer to me,negative
but thats not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from,negative
species was already a ripoff of alien but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the originals director roger donaldson did,negative
human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eves alien body which ironically was designed by alien designer h r giger,negative
a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns,negative
aliens sans flamethrowers,negative
the visual effects were by far the best thing about species and the sequels effects crew at steve johnsons xfx inc keeps that highquality tradition alive no cheaplooking lost in space cgi here,negative
after the effects the originals best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge,negative
however medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment,negative
at one point shes called on to play alien empath la forest whitaker in the original but for most of the duration shes holed up in a glass cell,negative
by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place the film is well into its home stretch,negative
so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick played with little zest by lazard,negative
one problem with the first film was that the deadly horny but innocentatheart sil was too sympathetic no such problem with patrick who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control,negative
the rest of the cast also fails to add much but the writing can be faulted for that,negative
helgenberger and madsen go through the motions but they are already hampered by the clich d development that somewhere between the two films the oncelinked laura and press stopped getting along,negative
williamson suffers the worst indignity,negative
he tries his best to enliven the token africanamerican role but how can anyone recite insulting derivative lines such as im gonna get african on someones ass and not appear ridiculous,negative
but species iis worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work,negative
at least the original featured plenty to laugh atunaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker and the sight of helgenbergers character performing fellatio on madsens for a start,negative
but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level,negative
for all the blood and gore nudity and sex thrown in species ii is quite simply a vapid bore,negative
conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that childrens items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twentyfive or thirty years after the item was made,negative
thats when the kids of that time have jobs disposable income and a desire to revisit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives,negative
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and youll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks,negative
theres a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen,negative
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the workaday world for a long time,negative
theyd like to recapture some of that fun they remember from days of yore,negative
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them,negative
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time,negative
and for the most part theyre messing it up,negative
mission impossible lost in space godzilla zorro,negative
none of these successfully capture the originals,negative
none of these are even good films,negative
you can now add the avengers to the list,negative
the british television series began in 1961,negative
super secret agent john steed thenpatrick macnee and his third partner emma peel thendiana rigg are the pair that the american audience fell for,negative
surrealistic and witty the series fit the mood of the times,negative
the leatherclad rigg probably didnt hurt the ratings either,negative
after all its not a coincidence that you cant pronounce her characters name without appeal,negative
now were in the nineties,negative
steed nowralph fiennes and peel nowuma thurman are battling evil genius sir august de wynter sean connery who is screwing with englands weather,negative
thats about as much of a plot as we have,negative
theres some footage about a lot of other things that either dont make sense or make even less sense,negative
we get betrayal for some unknown reason,negative
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film,negative
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason,negative
theres a high tech hot air balloon but i have no idea why anyones in it,negative
the spy agency is run by a man called mother who is in a wheelchair and a woman named father who is blind at,negative
least in some scenes,negative
theres probably a reason for all of this but well never know it,negative
macnee makes an appearance of sorts,negative
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing,negative
a group of villains sits around a table all clad in huge pastelcolored teddy bear outfits,negative
at first its humorous to watch the teddies waddle around but then it becomes goofy,negative
the movie is a medley of clutter confusion and wrong decisions around every corner,negative
it feels like major portions of the film are missing,negative
the storyline jumps rather than flows,negative
reportedly the film was recut several times,negative
this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing,negative
theres one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher,negative
other than that the effects are secondrate,negative
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes,negative
thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesnt work,negative
she looks good dresses in all the right fetish outfits but theres no spark,negative
fiennes fares even less well,negative
macnees steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor,negative
fiennes agent comes across as a dour kid in grownup clothes who has never been out of his home town,negative
even connery one of the greatest living actors doesnt have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes,negative
the action scenes are difficult to follow,negative
director jeremiah chechik responsible for the atrocious remake of diabolique somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldnt be,negative
things happen people move around but even if with the utmost effort you were able to care about any of it the scenes are bewildering,negative
the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads,negative
witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination,negative
admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film but theres no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever,negative
one of emma peels first lines of dialog is rules are made to be broken,negative
it doesnt get any better,negative
advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone,negative
the release date was changed several times,negative
connery refuses to promote the film,negative
there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers,negative
at least this way they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out,negative
admittedly i havent seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades,negative
my guess is that it would be severely dated now,negative
no matter how antiquated it might be theres no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing,negative
theres no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie,negative
no reason at all,negative
the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images,negative
the tinkling christmas tree bell in its a wonderful life,negative
bogies speech at the airport in casablanca,negative
little elliotts flying bicycle silhouetted by the moon in e t,negative
and now starship troopers director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug,negative
starship troopers loosely based on the robert heinlein novel is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects,negative
in the hands of verhoeven the mammoth scifi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale,negative
to put it simply its a bug bomb,negative
in robocop and total recall verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence special effects and social satire and starship troopers starts off in similar fashion with a tongueincheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise,negative
things go downhill fast though as we meet our heroes a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school,negative
inexplicably johnny rico carmen ibenez dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by squarejawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial,negative
its a veritable alpha centuri 90210 as we watch the lovesmitten teens squabble in the name of love,negative
michael ironside plays their teacher who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities,negative
eventually the kids join the military with dreams of glory in their addled little minds,negative
one of their classmates carl jenkins doogie housers neil patrick harris snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities,negative
he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mothers leg,negative
a long dull boot camp sequence follows enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the showgirls directors camera roams over their buff bodies,negative
finally a full hour into the film the war finally starts and we meet the enemy,negative
the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space,negative
they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears,negative
yes incredible as it seems the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts,negative
a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best,negative
sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary but the closeups are a different matter,negative
the insects have an odd artificial look like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating,negative
the attack scenes are intensely violent as one would expect from verhoeven but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension,negative
while the action is frantic the military strategy wildly illogical even by hollywood standards grows tiresome quickly,negative
verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage but the fauxjingoistic scenes of children doing their part for the war effort by squishing roaches on a sidewalk arent enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck,negative
one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here,negative
his customary one part satire two parts ultraviolence formula is way out of whack and most of the film just flounders,negative
in showgirls fashion some scenes are almost bad enough to be good,negative
an intergalactic kegger party with jake busey playing dixie on a green plexiglas fiddle has a certain bizarre appeal,negative
a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug but tells her hero that she doesnt mind dying,negative
its okay she gasps i got to have you,negative
and then of course theres doogies mind meld with a bug,negative
its possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel,negative
heinleins pre stranger in a strange land books were aimed at adolescent males and starship troopers has the antiseptic retrofuture look of late 50 60s scifi,negative
the one cityscape shown is a jetsonslike gleaming metropolis with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting,negative
the hairstyles are retro too straight from the frankie avalon annette funicello school of fashion,negative
ultimately verhoevens motives are irrelevant,negative
he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire,negative
it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie,negative
avoid starship troopers at all costs,negative
what were they thinking,negative
nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough but do we really need an eighties film,negative
robbie hart adam sandler used to want to be a rock and roll star but in 1985 hes singing at weddings and having a good time,negative
a romantic at heart he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his highschool sweetie,negative
when she leaves him waiting at the altar his tune changes to love stinks,negative
he meets waitress julia drew barrymore who is engaged to a junkbonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together,negative
in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie,negative
sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role but there is no spark,negative
barrymore doesnt seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it beauty but no attitude,negative
both characters are just there,negative
bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show,negative
the eighties are shoved in our face,negative
references to deloreans madonna dallas ivana and donald burt and loni and miami vice get old fast,negative
the filmmakers must have realized that there wasnt much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions,negative
theyre not funny and it doesnt work,negative
with change on all fronts accelerating more and more nostalgia appears to have a great appeal but dont you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past,negative
maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino,negative
michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be,negative
a film that means well but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama,negative
its jeroen krabb s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who cant forget their bitter past,negative
the heroine is an attractive carefree nonreligious 20yearold chaja fraser who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations screwing a student rebel leader and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother s gebrecht and her selfabsorbed eccentric father schell,negative
her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps and her home life is filled with angst,negative
her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos a family album silverware and his old violin,negative
he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis but cant locate them now due to all the changes in the city,negative
out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building mr apfelschnitt topol tells her about,negative
the hasidics are ultraorthodox they dont go to the cinema or watch tv adhere to strict dress codes and strictly observe their religious laws,negative
chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules but soon finds the wife mrs kalman rossellini to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children a 4yearold named simcha monty who doesnt talk,negative
the stern mr kalman krabb is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses,negative
to hammer home the point of how antisemitism hasnt gone away theres a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge bradley who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator,negative
the film is done in by its hamfisted script as the story adapted from carl friedmans book the shovel and the loom goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality,negative
it starts off telling chajas story of how shes a lost jewess trying to find her identity then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that cant be forgotten,negative
the effort seemed heavyhanded as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters,negative
the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring chajas parents are given no human shades while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was onedimensional and falsely acted,negative
the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence but is strong in accepting her faith,negative
topols reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense,negative
the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it cant love it starts out by showing how under chajas loving care hes taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away beginning by saying quack quack and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder,negative
but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence refuses to speak because of his stern dad and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident the film thereby exploits the boys sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done,negative
i felt i didnt just see a movie but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story,negative
it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarilythe message it keeps sending was already received,negative
in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past,negative
that seems strange since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about,negative
unless i was mistaken and the films real aim was to make us cry over simcha,negative
payback brian helgelands inauspicious directing debut coincidentally he previously penned the awardwinning screenplay for 1997s l a confidential is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one ideaa movie with nonstop violence death and villainsand runs with it or should i say barely manages to crawl away with it,negative
mel gibson in yet another disappointing picture conspiracy theory and lethal weapon 4 anyone stars as the reprehensible porter a man who becomes determined to get his 50 share of 140 000 which he stole in a robbery back when his partnerincrime gregg henry and drugaddicted wife deborah kara unger doublecross him shoot him and leave him for dead,negative
porter is not dead howevernot by a long shotas he quickly rehabilitates and along with his loyal prositute girlfriend rosie maria bello sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay,negative
the tagline for payback is get ready to root for the bad guy and sure enough this is true as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way,negative
i wouldnt have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest but it wasnt and therefore i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever,negative
no attempt is made to flesh the roles into threedimensional characters and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them,negative
just because the protagonist a bad guy is played by mel gibson doesnt mean i will root for him and i didnt,negative
quite the contrary every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death although some of them did anyway just to spice up the dull proceedings,negative
since none of the respectable actors in payback actually have human beings to play only one performance managed to stand out,negative
lucy alexis liu of t v s ally mcbeal who plays a spicy sm dominatrix brightens up every scene she is in and has a definite flair for comedy something i would have liked to have seen more of since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat,negative
meanwhile gibson who is perfectly fine here sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging,negative
unger who made an impression in 1997s the game is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in and only has two purproses 1 to get high on heroin and 2 because she plays a key part in an early flashback,negative
finally kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb tellingly he didnt appear in the original cut of the film but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later,negative
like most action movies the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking,negative
in the course of the 102minute running time of payback porter is shot three times in the back hit by a van beaten up and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer,negative
and guess what,negative
not only does he survive the whole ordeal but he is happygolucky in the penultimate sequence and can still walk,negative
even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag,negative
payback is not in any way an entertaining film even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen,negative
perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours,negative
ive never written a review for a movie i havent watched all the way through but i had to make an exception with powder,negative
i was about fortyfive minutes into this one at a friends house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house,negative
so i never got to finish the movie and im sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie,negative
but i can at least get a partial review out of it because i saw enough to know this one wasnt worth finishing in the first place,negative
the movie centers around a freaky teenager whos spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house,negative
when grandpa dies taking his department store down with him social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder first and middle names,negative
gold bond to a state home where we find out hes a different from the other kids,negative
actually we find out hes different when we first see him because hes the most pale individual weve ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever,negative
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie the father takes one look at him and says hes not my son,negative
obviously,negative
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago,negative
so the whitefaced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids,negative
that is until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him wear his spoon you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass,negative
decisions decisions and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table,negative
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy his mother must be sissy spaceks carrie character,negative
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes as we find out powder has some sort of superintelligence your i q,negative
test went straight off the chart,negative
and attracts electrical power,negative
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school if hes such a genius already why would he need a high school education and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblums science class,negative
goldblum plugs in a jacobs ladder device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powders chest,negative
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching instead of just unplugging the damn thing,negative
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row following hideaway and nine months,negative
thats about all i saw before the big fight began and let me tell you that was twice as interesting as the movie itself,negative
but like i said i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization,negative
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guys personality overlooking his personal appearance,negative
i already had the female character picked out the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene but i guess ill never know for sure what happened,negative

powder a film review by andrew hicks copyright 1996 andrew hicks fatboy productions,negative
ive never written a review for a movie i havent watched all the way through but i had to make an exception with powder,negative
i was about fortyfive minutes into this one at a friends house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house,negative
so i never got to finish the movie and im sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie,negative
but i can at least get a partial review out of it because i saw enough to know this one wasnt worth finishing in the first place,negative
the movie centers around a freaky teenager whos spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house,negative
when grandpa dies taking his department store down with him social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder first and middle names,negative
gold bond to a state home where we find out hes a different from the other kids,negative
actually we find out hes different when we first see him because hes the most pale individual weve ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever,negative
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie the father takes one look at him and says hes not my son,negative
obviously,negative
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago,negative
so the whitefaced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids,negative
that is until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him wear his spoon you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass,negative
decisions decisions and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table,negative
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy his mother must be sissy spaceks carrie character,negative
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes as we find out powder has some sort of superintelligence your i q,negative
test went straight off the chart,negative
and attracts electrical power,negative
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school if hes such a genius already why would he need a high school education and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblums science class,negative
goldblum plugs in a jacobs ladder device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powders chest,negative
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching instead of just unplugging the damn thing,negative
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row following hideaway and nine months,negative
thats about all i saw before the big fight began and let me tell you that was twice as interesting as the movie itself,negative
but like i said i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization,negative
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guys personality overlooking his personal appearance,negative
i already had the female character picked out the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene but i guess ill never know for sure what happened,negative
my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one but in fact the third installment it was the first to gain a national theatrical release,negative
i didnt see the first film until much later,negative
so looking back the original didnt hold a lot of great memories for me since i didnt think too much of it when i initially saw it,negative
watching it now for a second time confirmed that its an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever,negative
you all know the story by now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before,negative
this first installment does an adequate job with its low budget but theres some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story,negative
plus the movies ending understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a hook for a sequel renders the rest of the film pointless,negative
and does anyone understand what happens to nancys mother at the end of this film,negative
dont get me wrong though,negative
its not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics,negative
most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is,negative
horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly and a nightmare on elm street just doesnt cut it,negative
a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video,negative
it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set,negative
the film is presented in both pan and scan and its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 78 1 although on the disc that comes in the box set only a widescreen transfer is provided,negative
the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 1 mix,negative
also included on the dvd is a fulllength audio commentary track with wes craven stars john saxon and heather langenkamp and the films director of photography,negative
other extras include the jump to a nightmare feature im sure you can figure that one out the usual cast and crew bios which are from the films original press release kit and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp and the films original theatrical trailer,negative
some dvdrom features are also included but since i dont have dvdrom capabilities i cant really get into that,negative
the commentary track is entertaining and informative but nothing spectacular,negative
the first thing of note is that its the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago,negative
im not saying thats a negative thing just pointing it out,negative
everyone seems enthusiastic about being there with the possible exception of john saxon who just doesnt say much at all,negative
most of the time youll forget hes even there,negative
everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason as if because theyre commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible,negative
the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series,negative
also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film,negative
however you can only access one easily,negative
the other is hidden in whats called the labyrinth which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created,negative
basically its an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage interviews etc somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film,negative
finding it though is both a chore and a bore,negative
r,negative
synopsis a humorless police officers life changes when he befriends a supersmart superadorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute young blond scientist,negative
unfortunately einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfootsized apecreature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine and this rogainenightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl,negative
meanwhile a group of white chainsmoking guntoting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie,negative
comments watchers reborn a cheaply made directtovideo turkey is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers,negative
technically this should have been called watchers v but it seems that this cycle of horror movies much like many other sequelcrazy film series has decided to drop the numbers from the titles,negative
even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi,negative
the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago,negative
this really isnt a good movie,negative
have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation,negative
well any hope a viewer may have had perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill will be dashed by the time hes seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn,negative
theyre awful,negative
these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer some weird crap about a dead indian teens and wolves and an action movie called detonator starring scott baio,negative
scott baio,negative
what idiot dreamed this movie up,negative
after surviving these abysmal trailers the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented watchers reborn,negative
maybe it wont be that bad he may say to himself,negative
perhaps just perhaps the bottomofthebarrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading,negative
watchers reborn after all is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago,negative
it stars mark hamill luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy,negative
lou rawls is even in the mix,negative
unfortunately the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill he looks very sick here and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers the book,negative
the latter is really too bad,negative
koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good but he is still my favorite hack writer,negative
koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful,negative
people who read many of his books however often complain of repetitive plot devices,negative
its definately not a koontz book if there isnt 1 a psychic 2 a superintelligent dog or 3 a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs,negative
watchers has all three devices which may explain why its arguably the most popular of koontzs books,negative
the idea behind koontzs novel though highly implausible is very interesting,negative
basically a biological war machine is created a smart dog can be released in battle track down its target and then relay the targets position psychically to a large creature designed to kill in handtohand combat,negative
silly but kind of neat too,negative
im sorry,negative
i dont mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn the movie,negative
i suppose i just dont want to talk about the movie itself,negative
this turkey is really cheesy,negative
no one in this movie can act including mark hamill and its difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero,negative
the cheese factor is only increased when hes involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist geneticist zoologist whateverthef kshessupposedtobe whom he befriends,negative
mercifully the filmmakers opted not to do nudity,negative
to be honest the only halfconvincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein,negative
you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts,negative
i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie,negative
and the creature,negative
yes the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling,negative
this creature is shot about 500 000 times but its okay,negative
the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing,negative
oh he can also rip body parts off allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around,negative
cheesy gore,negative
thats another main element of watchers reborn,negative
it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the films campiness rather than its suspense,negative
ultimately i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror scifi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the films silliness though this film will tax even their patience its an 83 minute film but it feels like four hours,negative
also i hate to admit i have survived far worse than this,negative
anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin fear the rush will know what i mean,negative
finally i couldnt help but think that watchers reborn would work well as bot fodder for the creative folks behind one of my alltime favorite shows mystery science theater 3000,negative
this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face,negative
rated r watchers reborn contains dozens of bloodspattered bodies and unconvincing gore,negative
it also has violence obviously,negative
i wouldnt recommend it for the little kids but im sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay,negative
instead of watching this film however i recommend reading koontzs book,negative
trust me itll be time much much better spent,negative
talk about beating a dead horse,negative
when home alone was released in 1990 it was a breath of fresh air and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinelyfunny family film,negative
the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel so two years later we were subjected to home alone 2 which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited,negative
for john hughes two home alone movies werent enough he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with including a pathetic box office bomb called babys day out last years liveaction 101 dalmatians and this years flubber,negative
now inexplicably hughes has exhumed not only these wornout plot elements but the home alone name as well,negative
the result 1997s worst sequel edging out speed 2 and batman and robin home alone 3,negative
by changing the characters hughes who wrote and coproduced the film along with his coconspirator director raja gosnell has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest,negative
the new kid alex pruitt is played by alex d linz one fine day and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness,negative
hes not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was,negative
the villains pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber,negative
in home alone 3 there are four of them olek krupa david thornton lenny von dohlen and rya kihlstedt but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls,negative
this time the kid isnt left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip,negative
instead he has developed a bad case of chicken pox so he cant go to school,negative
his dad kevin kilner is away on business and his mom haviland morris has to run errands so for the most part hes all by himself during the day,negative
through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate a top secret u s air force integrated circuit comes into his possession,negative
its wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alexs home to retrieve it,negative
the eight year old who is wise beyond his years booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldbergtype devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains,negative
the movies climax takes place during a raging snowstorm only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable,negative
previously the most counterfeitlooking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii,negative
these are far worse,negative
in fact the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this nearblizzard when a shining sun can be seen,negative
if its a wonderful life could generate real looking snow back in the 1940s why cant home alone 3 which has a significantly larger budget and 90s technology at its disposal,negative
there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of liveaction cartoon violence for young children,negative
home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire,negative
its one thing to see wyle e coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen,negative
adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous but what about five and sixyear olds,negative
the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme many of alexs schemes are nasty enough to kill,negative
but because this is a family film no one dies despite being electrocuted falling thirty feet and getting smacked on the head by a barbell,negative
not only is home alone 3 unnecessary but its offensive,negative
its an exercise in tediousness and there isnt a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end unless by some strange quirk of fate you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes and thus havent seen this stuff before,negative
i cant imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure,negative
maybe thats why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumbsucking years,negative
i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really indepth articles about some incident,negative
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail,negative
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested and what kind of pressure the investigators are under and just about any other aspect you can think of,negative
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know,negative
often i get to the middle of a story and say ok it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject,negative
film is a different medium,negative
it is a visual medium,negative
that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize,negative
i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space,negative
the magazine article and the film script are two very different media,negative
the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article the man who knew too much by marie brenner,negative
it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film,negative
it really verges on being tedious at least at times,negative
for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy sideeffects,negative
but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it,negative
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco,negative
the tide turned when a former vicepresident of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking,negative
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs,negative
who were the major people involved what were their motives how was the story almost killed how did it get aired anyway,negative
that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider,negative
this all could have been enthralling but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well,negative
and in the end he failed,negative
to make a long story short the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short,negative
the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist,negative
we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand,negative
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace played by christopher plummer,negative
there the news team under producer lowell bergman al pacino are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it,negative
this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world,negative
terrorists can grab the headlines but the tobacco companies have the real position of power,negative
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work to his home,negative
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly,negative
he had been a very profitably rewarded vicepresident in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family,negative
rather than support him his wife liane diane venora demands of him what are they supposed to do for income,negative
meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand,negative
they offer wigand 12 000 just to interpret the data,negative
wigands severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms,negative
he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman,negative
in spite of the secrecy wigands former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role,negative
and so the game begins,negative
wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer,negative
meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family,negative
the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants,negative
wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out,negative
he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight,negative
al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider,negative
the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail,negative
the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience,negative
the musical score by pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory,negative
it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling,negative
also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace,negative
plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too wellknown for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly,negative
this film might have been a really engaging experience under another directors control,negative
michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style,negative
i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie be happy i wont bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend boxoffice after scoring huge successes with men in black 710 directed by the same man who controlled this one and independence day 610,negative
can you say the,negative
third times not a charm,negative
plot james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nations top scientists and threatening to take over the united states within a week,negative
critique i did not laugh once during this entire picture,negative
when you consider that this film is a partcomedy thats not a very good sign,negative
i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes,negative
when you consider that the other part of this film is geared as an i would say that this another negative sign,negative
and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow the storyline tired reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame oneliners weak characterizations and an anticlimactic end you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this big summer blockbuster,negative
it blows,negative
or as they say in french eet blows,negative
could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it,negative
maybe,negative
could it be that most of the special effects dont show up until the last half hour and even then we dont see anything that its trailers hadnt already given away,negative
perhaps,negative
or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood bigbudget movies that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own,negative
naaaaaaah,negative
a bad movie is a bad movie,negative
on a positive note i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek who seemed underused in my humble opinion and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in,negative
branagh was also fun as the scenerymunching overthetop bad guy but thats pretty much where the entertainmentbuck stopped,negative
smith and kline were static at best the plot full of holes and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others,negative
i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie,negative
then again there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage huh oh,negative
yeah but the rest of the movie sucked,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars will smith has starred in two of the ten alltime top grossing films worldwide 1997s summer blockbuster men in black 710 for which he also recorded the grammywinning title song and 1996s independence day 610,negative
he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career,negative
kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama and has been married to the cuteasabutton actress phoebe cates since 1989,negative
they have two kids together greta simone and owen,negative
one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has kasdan written on it,negative
lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies including the big chill silverado i love you to death grand canyon and french kiss,negative
salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over even though she spoke no english,negative
she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders mi vida loca no not the rickie martin video and played her first starring role in robert rodriguezs desperado opposite antonio banderas,negative
since then she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguezs films,negative
she stands 52 was born in southeast mexico and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother,negative
one of the actresses cast as branaghs lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner 710,negative
another is dutchborn frederique van der wal who is one of the worlds most recognized supermodels having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times as well as harpers bazaar vogue and mademoiselle,negative
hello kids,negative
today the movie studios want to take over my critical review and somehow persuade you that armageddon the summers biggest blockbuster is a film for everybody,negative
and remember if a film is for everybody and if it makes the most money for the summer it must be good right,negative
armageddon is a comedy with a capital c,negative
it stars bruce willis who has a hundred oneliners,negative
it has a tiny rock land directly in the middle of a heated argument in new york city,negative
and chuckle chuckle one of those new yorkers survives with charcoal all over his face,negative
snorkle sniff hiccup,negative
and it has steve buscemi as a genius who wants to work for an oil rig,negative
kneeslap,negative
isnt this just so so funny,negative
armageddon also has romance with a capital r,negative
it has a tender moment between forbidden lovers ben affleck and liv tyler with with animal crackers,negative
and it has will patton as a long lost husband trying to reunite with his separated wife and child who thinks hes a salesman,negative
gurgle sniff awwwww,negative
and it has steve buscemi spewing more oneliners about minors and strippers,negative
umm moving right along,negative
armageddon also has lots of action with a capital a,negative
not just any action sequence would do,negative
it must have original action sequences that are designed to thrill,negative
like drill darn it drill,negative
and lets have inept people destroy the mir space station,negative
cant you hear your heart beating,negative
and steve buscemi goes crazy and starts shooting at people,negative
what drama,negative
lastly armageddon is out there to save the planet with a capital p,negative
this cant be any old thrillerwe must have an asteroid the size of texas head straight for earth,negative
and and we must have beautiful scenic worldwide shots like paris blown up,negative
and and we must have peoples of all colors nations and religions join hand in hand for one final hopeful hug,negative
the final sequence where muslims in prostrate worship stand upin domino fashionto cheer the victory filled me with such emotional goo that i wanted to to to rip the screen into shreds,negative

any film that could take the indiefilms most valuable talents and throw it all away with a bruce willis vehicle a hundredmillion dollar budget but have cheapo sets and lousy special effects is bottom line living proof that hell exists and has made a multipicture deal with universal,negative
in the midst of all the action the terseness the oneliners the fake sets the overall waste of time i recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician malloy give me a reading,negative
remember him,negative
he was a principal player in last years in the company of men a film that was more powerful shocking terrifying funny and shocking than armageddon could ever aspire to be,negative
armageddon cost over 100 million to make,negative
itcom cost a paltry 30 000,negative
need i say more,negative
the following review encompasses two versions of dune,negative
dune the theatrical version 1984 runtime 137 minutes capsule review cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book,negative
the films visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative,negative
dune the extended version 1988 runtime 189 minutes capsule review a bit of a throwtogether assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television,negative
it was disowned by director david lynch but its considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline,negative
quality dubs of this version from the outofprint japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web,negative
the review,negative
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of 40 million the film of frank herberts cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by scifi fans,negative
director david lynch blue velvet eraserhead twin peaks was working on his biggest production to date a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico,negative
the screenplay was lynchs own chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected,negative
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors,negative
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis dune a windswept desert planet thats home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange,negative
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe,negative
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it,negative
most importantly it allows the navigators of the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated to fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish,negative
lynchs film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the storys two main strands,negative
one is the longstanding rivalry between two families houses atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis,negative
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah longawaited by the natives of arrakis the fremen,negative
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom,negative
unfortunately this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended,negative
the thinking among universals ohsowise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office,negative
with lynchs initial cut running at closer to three or more hours the studio demanded that further cuts be made,negative
what a great idea,negative
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible,negative
the most glaring consequence of this oneeyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters,negative
thus their personalities are vague their motivations unclear and in the case of pauls father duke leto their demise rather meaningless,negative
the end result is a distinct chill we cant warm to most of the cast and we dont care much for them,negative
and it hardly helps that the voiceover narration is sparse and that the duneesque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book,negative
dune is also a very serous film,negative
the constant selftalk by various characters makes it so serious and selfabsorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment,negative
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them,negative
humour or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad sadistic kind is hard to find,negative
you may balk at the comparison but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy,negative
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster however,negative
it still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative scifi,negative
special effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms are an awesome sight,negative
both the production design anthony masters and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original,negative
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years,negative
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography the film is at least a feast for the senses,negative
see it in the widescreen format if you can,negative
and despite all the cuts several cast members still make a strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen,negative
sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader of the bene gesserit religious order whos secret aim is to manipulate pauls destiny for its own shadowy ends,negative
as paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade,negative
the conclusion,negative
any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herberts original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker,negative
david lynch took a brave stab at it and partly due to forces beyond his control ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects,negative
dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release,negative
many chose to stay away altogether as the films disastrous box office showing attests,negative
the extended version however is a rather different beast,negative
in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition directors cut of the film on home video a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres,negative
but alas he failed to do so choosing to move on to other projects,negative
in a way then it is partly lynchs own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa,negative
stung into action lynch successfully petitioned the directors guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with allen smithee the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work,negative
he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous judas booth,negative
certainly looking at the results of mcas handiwork theres at least half a dozen instances that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons for the director to object,negative
but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas,negative
most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration both of which fill many holes in the original versions storyline,negative
pauls relationship with his father and associates is more intimate with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously,negative
the political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained,negative
pauls initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably,negative
and as further background a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe,negative
as a piece of storytelling then mca tvs version of dune is clearly superior,negative
as a piece of editing however it is at times surprisingly inept,negative
the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate,negative
theres some sloppy cutting too and in a few instances shots even appear out of order,negative
and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes eg,negative
ships coming and going soldiers coming and going is at times clearly outofcontext,negative
this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected and rightly so,negative
it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u s television,negative
but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasnt even in herberts book,negative
the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his heart plug,negative
its a surreal and disturbing episode thats very lynchesque but adds nothing to what we already know the baron is a nasty piece of work,negative
despite its own peculiar flaws then the extended version of dune is a generally superior film,negative
all up it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered fabricated or newly created sequences,negative
unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart the alan smithee version remains the closest well get to what the movie should have been,negative
on repeated viewings one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit,negative
still as one of this centurys great sciencefiction novels some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen,negative
with rumours circulating of a new six hour miniseries planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga,negative
one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself,negative
such was the case with boxing helena 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch daughter of the great david lynch,negative
made in the dying years of posttwin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs it was hyped as another warped twisted masterpiece of lynch clan,negative
kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract,negative
but the result was extremely disappointing film which quickly sank into welldeserved oblivion,negative
the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh played by julian sands talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena sherilyn fenn beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair,negative
cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to reestablish the relationship,negative
during one of such occasions helena is hit by a car and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her,negative
after she wakes up helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaughs stylish residence but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping,negative
she is still trying to escape so cavanaugh takes off her arms,negative
apart from casting sherilyn fenn audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies this film by ms lynch hasnt got anything in common with the works of directors more talented father,negative
despite rather bizarre subject the style of this film is conventional and setting is light characters are beautiful but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray,negative
jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos,negative
the actors arent good either,negative
julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains being neurotic doesnt suit him,negative
bill paxton was better for this role but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helenas boyfriend,negative
sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks but even the her greater effort in acting couldnt help this film,negative
the screenplay on the other hand is awful at least for someone who had made bestseller with laura palmers diary the events in this movie are implausible characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion,negative
one of those subplots involves character of cavanaughs regular girlfriend played by betsy clarke,negative
the twist at the end although unpredictable is unbelievable and the viewers who had the stomach to endure entire film would feel cheated,negative
all in all boxing helena is disorganised quasiartistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basingers career,negative
tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multitiered marketing materials for crap movies,negative
and here he hits rock bottom with planet of the apes,negative
i didnt expect much from this latest interpretation of pierre boulles classic novel planet of the apes,negative
i mean how could you top the force and impact of the original film intelligently coscripted by rod serling of twilight zone fame combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those damn dirty apes in one of his best roles of his career,negative
sadly i sat down to watch burtons version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes i was checking my watch and my girlfriend a big fan of the original film started to nod off,negative
this time around the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine braveheart and project x marky mark wahlberg who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter plays leo davidson a hot shot u s air force pilot,negative
leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms no real explanation given in the film and leo sends one of his genetically altered smart chimps into the storms to collect data,negative
leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp leo hops in another ship to find the monkey and then hes thrown through some type of timespace wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle,negative
leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo paul giamatti who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari helena bonham carter,negative
the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leos ship,negative
along the way monkeys played by tim roth overacting his role of a vicious general named thade and michael clarke duncan who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages just like battlefield earth,negative
in the end it all culminates into another braveheart ripoff human versus ape battle scene,negative
while rick bakers makeup work is amazing the script is a pathetic hodgepodge courtesy of three writers the acting is horrible and the surprise ending feels like a swing from a ballpeen hammer into the temple,negative
wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences,negative
this remake or reinterpretation as tim burton has proclaimed it is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film,negative
the ethical arguments about the equality of species fascism and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue an unimaginative narrative structure and a romance between a monkey and a human,negative
even chuck hestons antigun tirade in the de rigeur cameo seems shallow and jokey,negative
but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton,negative
even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america john badham could have directed this film,negative
even joel schumacher could have directed this film,negative
he probably should have,negative
burtons predominant themes of rejection isolation and the search for ones place in the universe as seen in ed wood edward scissorshands and peewees big adventure are completely absent in this planet,negative
i suppose thats what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole,negative
you dont need to have seen the original species to appreciate how utterly lousy species ii is,negative
with few exceptions sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them but the fact that species ii is a followup isnt the only reason its so miserable,negative
its the predictable storyline the cardboard characters the banal dialogue the failed attempts at humor the revolting special effects the gratuitous nudity all female of course the bad acting and the bland direction,negative
the plot simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle,negative
the slime well sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black,negative
that should have been the end of the movie right there,negative
back on terra firma at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and as youll remember if you saw the first movie driven by a strong urge to procreate,negative
on a parallel track government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film now called eve again played by natasha henstridge and are keeping her around for some testing,negative
this apparently includes observing eves reaction to the dukes of hazzard tv show which she appears to enjoy,negative
eves biorhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk mates which we are forced to witness in grossout detail but otherwise there doesnt appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film unless it was written into her contract lets hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only,negative
eve finally breaks free of her confinesand her brafor the finale but the effects are so messy you cant really see whats going on,negative
peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams i told em not to go,negative
at the top of his lungs referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle,negative
michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox so that he can enter high security areas flash a badge and claim to be press maybe as does marg helgenberger as dr laura baker the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns,negative
theyre both unbelievably wooden,negative
whats a talented filmmaker like peter medak the ruling class the krays let him have it doing directing this tripe i wonder,negative
its an unfortunate trend this oncetalented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like species ii,negative
last year peter hyams gave us the relic no thanks necessary there,negative
and the first species was helmed by roger donaldson who although certainly no genius behind the camera had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects,negative
is it just that there are no better offers out there,negative
species ii is worthless,negative
worse than that its also exploitative offensive and insulting to the intelligence at every turn,negative
its not that there isnt anything positive to say about the film,negative
there is,negative
after 92 minutes it ends,negative
gordy is not a movie it is a 90minutelong sesame street skit and a very bad one at that,negative
this movie is so stupid and dumb that its depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie,negative
im sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it,negative
it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy voiced by garms whose family has been taken away to up north which we know means death,negative
of course we can hear the animals talk to each other and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible,negative
actually its almost funny in a way,negative
the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears a little girl named jinnie sue macallister young who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him,negative
jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it,negative
what is the point of this,negative
maybe she is one of the producers relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something,negative
we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce roescher who is sad because his divorced mother is dating,negative
he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue but he accidentally falls in a pool probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a 200 suit on nah didnt see that one coming,negative
starts to drown and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him,negative
if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hanks grandfather the original ceo dies and leaves his fortune to hank,negative
and gordy,negative
of course there must be a villain but even this villain donadio as sipes isnt that evil,negative
he never raises his voice or becomes angry and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story,negative
its hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film or if the filmmakers are just this untalented and stupid,negative
at times gordy is tolerable to watch thus earning it one star and not the dreaded z,negative
but its just so unbelievably boring cliche dumb unfunny corny and just plain bad it may scare children it certainly disturbed me,negative
42196 12997 61397 see also babe,negative
its a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater,negative
and unfortunately with mans best friend well be waiting a while longer,negative
the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of biogenetics gone wrong,negative
sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a good story provokes her to snoop inside of emax a poorly guarded million dollar biolab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding,negative
the result she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake camouflage like a chameleon climb trees like a leopard and attack with the strength of tiger,negative
max takes a liking to sheedy and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax owned by henrikson,negative
well it doesnt take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman etc,negative
sheedy is a boring nonpresence on the screen tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the i apologize for a lack of credits,negative
i suppose i was eager to leave the theater and in my rush forgot to take note of the director writer producer etc,negative
henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film,negative
the movie depends upon its ability to impress the audience with animal special effects but all it presents is a dog that can growl open door handles with his paw sit roll over play dead and sick,negative
the rest of the special effects were so poor i found them offensive,negative
the film attains submediocrity an unambitious film at best,negative
horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite,negative
2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off,negative
it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways,negative
im not going into much greater detail than that since it would take forever to explain and quite frankly im not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that ive already wasted,negative
while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction 2 days in the valley falls way short,negative
this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello james spader and jeff daniels,negative
while the story isnt much and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots,negative
james spaders character while not much better than the rest is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way,negative
and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron in her first role,negative
you know a movie isnt that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women,negative
even if they are both gorgeous,negative
i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted,negative
but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result,negative
while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about,negative
if i were to put a number on it only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch,negative
this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent and even then prepare for disappointment,negative
not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again,negative
or at least not all of it anyway,negative
in double jeopardy the stakes are high,negative
think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker,negative
the finished product although able to maintain the viewers attention is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script,negative
alex ill take homicide for 400,negative
libby parsons ashley judd is a happily married mom leading a normal life,negative
one night her husband nick bruce greenwood takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat,negative
libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared,negative
she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck where she handles a fallen knife like any stupid character and is spotted by the coast guard who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening,negative
nick is presumed dead and although she pleads her innocence libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband,negative
now please dont think im spoiling any vital plot details because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans,negative
if you havent seen this preview dont read any further,negative
but seriously the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters,negative
during the most vital scenes in the movie i was anticipating every twist or surprise that eventually popped up on the screen,negative
i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals,negative
most unfortunately will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production,negative
one is tommy lee jones who plays travis lehman a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison,negative
jones is always wonderful as an authority figure and hes certainly familiar with this sort of role as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals,negative
judd as a likable heroin with gusto also has a chance to flex her acting abilities,negative
while emotionally unconvincing the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role perking up the movie like an injection of antidepressant,negative
the actors and their relationship together present the onetwo punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely,negative
and now back to the plot,negative
while behind bars libby learns an interesting little bit of information a person cant be convicted of the same crime twice,negative
this law called double jeopardy could be her motive for hunting down her husband,negative
who may still be alive,negative
yes you heard right,negative
the movie degenerates into a crosscountry chase where everything you expect to happen,negative
does,negative
the final scenes which could have redeemed the film are poorly handled by director bruce beresford whose previous work centers highly around drama driving miss daisy paradise road,negative
ironically it is those elements like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son that dont quite work here,negative
at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars,negative
unfortunately jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive and the real depth of his character is only skin deep,negative
but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material and both have some memorable comic moments,negative
judd in particular has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her parole officer,negative
hmmm,negative
perhaps this would have made a good comedy,negative
it is disappointing because there are the makings of a competent action film here,negative
its nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver and will entertain those who arent turned off by the woeful storyline,negative
tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldnt fool most children,negative
warning may contain slight mild spoilers,negative
rated r for intense some strong sexuality and language,negative
starring arnold schwarzeneggar robin tunney rod stieger gabriel byrne,negative
running time 132 minutes,negative
we go into a movie theater boom,negative
the lights go down our hearts race we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie weve been waiting to see for a long time comes on,negative
we sit there watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is,negative
why shouldnt i have know what i was getting myself into,negative
again like this past summers hit stigmata end of days may be worse,negative
its not like this is any kind of original idea it just throws in some rosemarys baby along with the devils advocate a little exorcist and some stigmata here and there,negative
whala you have end of days a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific,negative
sadly but truly again like most recent films all the good parts are in the trailers,negative
the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend and flop in the next,negative
jericho cane arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan living in gabriel byrnes body and stop him from impregnating christine york robin tunney because if he does and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist,negative
he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 and strangely hes trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes,negative
he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger in a terrific role and tries to save this girl leading to an ending thats satisfying but turns into a typical action movie,negative
thats pretty much it on plot,negative
it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it parts you have to wonder where all the money went,negative
as for arnie,negative
good role ok performance,negative
i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts,negative
the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film,negative
in the trailers it looks like a good scary action film and ends up being a boring long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions,negative
gabriel byrnes who ironically played a priest in stigmata here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character,negative
two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun the devils advocate and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also,negative
robin tunney great performance as always plays satans main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child,negative
of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isnt nothing new,negative
the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown though not nearly as the visual style was in stigmata,negative
here we are given great camera work and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just dont work in this movie,negative
the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home,negative
only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances the writing and visual style but the storyline and the finished product dont work as well,negative
the sad thing is that end of days had so many things going for it,negative
the plot could have been more organized the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mindnumbing,negative
at times it seems like armageddon and started to get old and tiresome,negative
hollywood is running out of ideas bad and like ive always said before needs new ones,negative
even with its 100m budget end of days is less than pleasing,negative
in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over and easily could have had a 70m budget,negative
maybe i sound crazy but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film and hope that they make it as good as the original,negative
we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the boxoffice,negative
we need to get more films like the blair witch project that could scare people to death while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch,negative
overblown effects stupid and thin plotline good performances disappointing umm,negative
yup those pretty much describe end of days,negative
it should have been a classic,negative
a great cast of respected supporting actors,negative
an interesting premise of loser comic book characters,negative
however mystery men proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999,negative
the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals,negative
the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise,negative
the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laughoutloud joke and mediocre small jokes it failed miserably at being entertaining at all,negative
the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons,negative
they had been used a number of times before in previous films the best ones which were mediocre to begin with were ruined in the trailer and the expectation of laughing at clever unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film,negative
mystery men might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business,negative
but with veterans doing this kind of junk it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought,negative
thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie,negative
the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy,negative
the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero captain amazing who has recently captured every evildoer in the city,negative
captain amazing played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear because of his success in the past is worried that he will lose popularity,negative
after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city geoffrey rush overacting just a bit too much to keep himself busy things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured,negative
it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day,negative
by the time this section of the plot is finished the interest for what happens if you havent already figured it out is very low,negative
there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention,negative
the first scene in the film which shows the wannabes trying to save the day feels like it was seriously edited down,negative
right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folks home by some masked goons captain amazing comes in and saves the day or ruins the movie,negative
instead of editing this scene more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr furious ben stiller and monica a waitress claire forlani or the vast majority of the film which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was,negative
a simple rule more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work,negative
another major problem with mystery men is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances,negative
the film depended on its cast to work fluently together like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion,negative
however most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way,negative
to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat paul reubens who disappeared from acting to everyones joy returns here leaving very little to be impressed about,negative
as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes,negative
fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of american pie and theres something about mary,negative
mystery men drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining,negative
anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way,negative
so why continue to watch,negative
this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure,negative
mystery men indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says i knew you could do it,negative
mystery men fails in every category it attempts to pass,negative
what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable,negative
terrible acting terrible script and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors,negative
im unpredictable,negative
an overexcited ben stiller shouts out,negative
no ben youre the complete opposite,negative
deadbang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up to its dumb title or at least to half of it,negative
although deadbang is definitely dead it is anything but a bang in fact they should have called this one dead bore,negative
in the film johnson plays,negative
you guessed it,negative
a cop,negative
the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character jerry beck is a gritty los angeles homicide detective a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on miami vice,negative
a la mel gibson in lethal weapon beck is an emotional wreck complete with violent outbursts unscrupulous police methods and a bleak outlook on life,negative
becks wife has just divorced him and she is cutting him off from their children,negative
she will not even allow him to wish them merry christmas by telephone,negative
but becks family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in deadbang,negative
beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop,negative
his investigation starts in l a and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp,negative
virtually every aspect of deadbang is inept and ineffective,negative
the plot is incoherent and full of holes,negative
the movie depicts becks investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions,negative
the action sequences in deadbang are strictly thirdrate and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense,negative
i certainly expected more from longtime director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller the manchurian candidateas well as black sunday seven days in may and the french connection ii,negative
in all fairness to frankenheimer however i should note that most of deadbangs shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction,negative
deadbang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting,negative
according to the movies production notes deadbang is based on the reallife experiences of stillactive detective jerry beck,negative
you would never guess this from watching deadbang however since the film totally lacks credibility it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable,negative
most of the characters in deadbang are either atrociously acted underdeveloped superfluous or all of the above,negative
william forsythe for example is painfully bad as arthur kressler a wholesome bythebook fbi agent whos offended by becks foul language and unorthodox methods,negative
forsythes lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable,negative
deadbang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid wkrp in cincinnati and franks place but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains,negative
the sole function of penelope ann millers character is to give deadbang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less,negative
i guess the films title refers to this love scene since its definitely a dead bang,negative
the only real virtue of deadbang believe it or not is don johnson who tries to overcome the limitations of the movies pitiful script,negative
johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life,negative
and i must admit that deadbang does have one or two amusing moments,negative
the funniest scene has johnson throwingup all over a criminal as he interrogates him,negative
but when barf is the highlight of a movie you know the movies in trouble,negative
the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck in which he cant keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen,negative
but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make,negative
louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice,negative
in order to woo his lady love serina louie makes friends with a young boy sammy who persuades teacher mrs hammerbottom carol burnett to allow louie to attend class,negative
louie learns to read and write and returns to his flock but is laughed at once again when no other swans can understand his message of love for serina,negative
to make matters worse louies father feels hes lost his honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of e b,negative
whites trumpet of the swan,negative
as jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so e b,negative
white is being returned to for childrens films,negative
the animated charlottes web has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of stuart little,negative
trumpet of the swan directed by richard rich 1999s animated the king and i the swan princess series is unlikely to be remembered along with those two,negative
trumpet of the swan is receiving a regional theatrical release but is sure to quickly appear on home video,negative
boston is one of the targetted cities because our hero louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in beantown,negative
he encounters a gypsylike con man in the public gardens who pitches louie and his trumpet as an added attraction to bostons swan boats,negative
louie stays at the ritz carlton before giving a concert at the hatch shell along the banks of the charles river,negative
at this point louies earned enough money so that dad can pay for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over serinas father,negative
trumpet of the swan features flat background art some poor sound syncing and insipid sugary songs,negative
this effort would be better suited to saturday morning television than the big screen but may be ok for the real small set,negative
absolute power the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff,negative
it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper,negative
one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood,negative
not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence,negative
continually underestimating the audience the film gives us information we already know or dont even need,negative
details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two nightvision goggles in their car,negative
oddly enough the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities,negative
a masterful jewelthief played by clint eastwood witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire played by e g,negative
marshall,negative
while robbing one of marshalls mansions he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault,negative
there through a twoway mirror he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay,negative
their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman,negative
in self defense the woman grabs a letteropener and stabs the man in the elbow,negative
she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men,negative
the man,negative
he is the president of the united states of america,negative
where does the film go wrong,negative
it cannot be the acting,negative
clint eastwood ed harris and gene hackman as the president give typecast but decent performances,negative
the cinematography is sufficient wild and erratic during action sequences dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue,negative
even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the genre,negative
the fault clearly lies in the screenplay and the screenplay alone,negative
while setting up a story about misuse of power about the true possessors of that power and about intrigue and doublecrossing it does not resolve it,negative
not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax,negative
rather the tense situations are left dangling at the end giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness,negative
an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant,negative
police officers are everywhere incognito of course,negative
at the same time not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives,negative
all three parties are unaware of each others presence,negative
this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood who might suspect this is a trap will get himself out of this difficult position,negative
he will probably have a brilliant plan involving ingenious preparations,negative
however when he arrives at the trap both hit men miss how convenient and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away,negative
the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes,negative
ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap,negative
the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds,negative
parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter,negative
the daughter blames her father for never being there for her because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere,negative
of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family,negative
again it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot,negative
however trying is simply not enough,negative
the second story line should be subtle original and preferably unpredictable,negative
everything this film is not,negative
how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced,negative
how could eastwood who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven ever believe in a project like this one,negative
i am sad to say that my respect for the producer has diminished substantially due to this film,negative
director quentin tarantino once said i can make a good movie out of any bad script,negative
director clint eastwood obviously cannot,negative
in twilight a exalcoholic excop exhusband exprivateeye harry ross paul newman works for a pair of aging hollywood actors catherine susan sarandon and jack ames gene hackman,negative
jack is being blackmailed and he asks harry to deliver the payoff,negative
instead of the blackmailers harry finds a dying excop m,negative
emmet walsh,negative
as more bodies begin to pile up harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherines first husband twenty years earlier to find out whos willing to kill to keep that secret buried,negative
newman sarandon,negative
hackman,negative
with an alist cast of oscar laureates like that twilight would seem very promising,negative
however the script is tired and predictable,negative
it would serve well as a tvmovieoftheweek possibly with some 1970s detective hero reprising his role,negative
the appeal of the project for its stars and its director robert benton is nostalgia,negative
twilight wants very much to be a 1940s film noir with alan ladd or dick powell,negative
all of the standard tropes are here a hardboiled p i,negative
among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero shadowy figures shooting from doorways dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation,negative
the script offers little originality and coauthors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich in 1998,negative
elmer bernsteins score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn notefornote from a vintage noir,negative
the lead actors try hardnone of the three has every made less than a full effort even when burdened with a bad script,negative
they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters,negative
harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine,negative
jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harrys love for catherine,negative
catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefullymaintained veneer,negative
twilight wants to be characterdriven like nobodys fool also directed by benton also starring newman based on a novel by russo was but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with,negative
twilight also squanders a fine supporting cast stockard channing harrys friend on the police force reese witherspoon jack catherines bratty kid giancarlo esposito the humorous sidekick john spencer harrys nemesis on the force liev schreiber and margo martindale the blackmailers and james garner a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble,negative
saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night and i have to say i wasnt too impressed,negative
this film is about an expert marine sniper played by tom berenger who is teamed with a hotshotyoungnoexperienceneverkilledaman new partner to take out some drugkingpins and military strong men in panama,negative
sound cliche,negative
thats only the beginning,negative
billy zane memphis belle played the rookie and never seemed to get a handle on his character,negative
he was so contrary and pigheaded in the beginning you just wanted to smack him,negative
then he goes crazy from the pressure but seems to immediately snap out of it,negative
im not sure if the blame should lie with the directing editing scriptwriting or acting,negative
but it didnt all come together,negative
i think berenger is a pretty good actor and he looked great in the part covered in camo face painted stalking through the jungle with his highpower rifle,negative
but once again his character was given some pretty bad dialogue and didnt react too logically to many of the situations,negative
there was very little logical development in these characters,negative
my biggest problem with this film was its tendency to put these two snipers in as many inchesfromdeath situations as possible,negative
they began to resemble g i joes the greatest american hero,negative
and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls,negative
now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold in fact thats what made die hard so much fun the superhero avenger type,negative
so some will enjoy the action hero heroics but i didnt think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes and the real life feel of covert operations in panama,negative
a word must be said on the camera work much of it was very nice,negative
the jungles of panama or their standins in this case formed a very picturesque background,negative
and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography,negative
many have seen the slowed down bulletcam following the projectile to its target,negative
this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill,negative
it was dramatic when used in flashback but,negative
it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots pardon the pun into the real time action then,negative
it just seemed silly,negative
all in all not a real dog there is some nice action good atmosphere and pretty photography,negative
but the plot is pretty lame the acting didnt form a cohesive whole and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics,negative
cashing in on the success of white men cant jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles including the cowboy way and drop zone wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed hoping that they can strike up the same success,negative
sadly if this dismal cliche ridden and mindnumbingly boring action pic is anything to go by they havent got a chance in hell of even coming close,negative
this time out the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops,negative
following several runins with their tyrannical boss robert blake who is obsessed with the money train a train which carries all the subways takingsand will let nothing stop it now theres an original plot device harrelsons character decides to try and take off with the cash,negative
along the way both of them fall in love with the same womananother transit cop who also hates her boss,negative
this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard you were always the better brother etc etc etc and doesnt help to add anything to the film,negative
given a better script better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time the film almost went for two hoursor did it just feel like it this film might and i mean might have turned out okay but as it is it is stocked with the worst action film cliches whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time,negative
robert blake who plays the evil boss has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history,negative
he sounds like wayne newton and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets,negative
but this is only one of money trains problems,negative
if you look at the script as if it was an action film it lacks originality and suspense,negative
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film it is even worse,negative
the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely aint butch and sundance,negative
the film isnt all bad though,negative
snipes and harrelson when they arent using the dumb cliches that the script gives them make an agreeable duo and some of the stuntwork is indeed excellent,negative
but good stuntwork cannot save a bottomofthebarrel action movie,negative
if youre a really undemanding action freak theres a chance youll like this,negative
but if youre looking for something original or suspenseful try somewhere elsei doubt youll find it here,negative
capsule where are you tonight leni rienfenstal,negative
starship troopers is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography and bad pornography at that,negative
it is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun its so cynically calculatedly boneheaded that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed,negative
its one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time,negative
why am i calling this movie pornography,negative
pornography in the abstract is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts,negative
i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper as a nearpornographic eternity,negative
i didnt agree with that assessment but i could see what was being implied the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout do er man do er,negative
that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers,negative
its literally like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk,negative
it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening,negative
the film takes place in our future when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesnt appear to have intelligence,negative
to counterattack humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which theyre clearly capable of they send down grunts with m16 rifles,negative
this isnt heinlein its a bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome,negative
one scene has a journalist on a battlefield filimg soldiers being slaughtered and ends with groaning predictability said cameraman gets skewered too,negative
the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic,negative
they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense,negative
they dont even behave like soldiers in a bad movie and therefore we dont care about them,negative
we hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate,negative
here we dont even hate the bugs whats there to hate,negative
hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine,negative
if theres anything really hateful there the movie doesnt know how to give it to us,negative
the screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps a better appelation would be screen typist and director the increasingly talentimpaired paul verhoeven have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other,negative
one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot whos great at getting out of tight situations and does it again and again and again,negative
once or twice is fine,negative
by the fifth or sixth time its worn out its welcome,negative
theres never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle,negative
also the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry,negative
if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing,negative
but if one human gets cornered he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip,negative
uhhuh,negative
the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasifascist flavor,negative
i say quasi because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action the gear the uniforms etc the movie doesnt have the nerve or the brains to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject,negative
the bumpers between scenes which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison,negative
like the rest of the movie,negative
theres more i suppose but its not worth it,negative
the acting is bland neither arsenic nor gravy the music disposable the camerawork turgid,negative
the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece,negative
as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment hollywood doesnt loose the oppertunity to get involved by telling stories and expressing opinions,negative
this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels hays hodges tommy lee jones and terry childers samuel l jackson,negative
they fought side by side in vietnam where childers saved hodges life by shooting an unarmed pow,negative
thats against the rules of war but understandable in this story anyway under the specific circumstances,negative
certainly hodges is not complaining,negative
years pass,negative
hodges whose wounds make him unfit for action gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer,negative
childers is now a respected and muchdecorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould,negative
because of his excellent record childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ben kingsley cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops,negative
childers does what he has to do evacuate the family and protect the men under his command,negative
after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd,negative
more than 80 yemeni men women and children are mowed down,negative
childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians,negative
he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film,negative
did childers violate authorized u s military rules of engagement,negative
or are there simply no rules in war,negative
the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions,negative
the murder of 83 innocent civilians has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u s where is the accusations from the arab leaders,negative
where is the u n,negative
the film ends without even telling the most interesting story what happens on the international arena,negative
this film in a way akin to films such as a few good men has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism,negative
these accusations are pretty heavy but also unfair,negative
what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking,negative
one of the earliest apparent problems with rules of engagement is its lack of credibility,negative
the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now but is overdone contrived and unrealistic as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed,negative
a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality,negative
that is precisely why its not offensive,negative
it is completely unobjective,negative
many stories are started and never finished,negative
many questions are asked but never answered,negative
a lot of parallels are referring to nothing,negative
it seems that neither the director producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film,negative
is it about arab mentality,negative
americas foreign policies,negative
americas role in the world,negative
corruption in the higher circles,negative
it goes on and on,negative
it consists of countless stories but not a definable plot,negative
it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one,negative
i think that it is ironic because director william friedkins probably most acclaimed film was the exorcist which had a silly story but became a rather effective film,negative
in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film,negative
though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism such as the impressive battle scenes his latest film does simply not engage,negative
i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed,negative
its obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe,negative
the characters feel designed unreal merely shadows with no life outside the conflict,negative
even the actors can not save this film from going under,negative
though both jackson and jones act admirably with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this it is not something that these great actors can boast of,negative
they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back,negative
jackson is gray and jones uninteresting,negative
the rest of the cast including ben kingsly blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks,negative
the time has come for the verdict,negative
on the charges of complete lack of objectivity i find this film guilty,negative
on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking i find it guilty,negative
but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty because of its inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere not only when concerning the arab population,negative
i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood badguys,negative
this is very sad since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth,negative
however it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states,negative
and that its not a coincidence that u s residents in the middle east including yemen are on constant maximum alert,negative
first impressions critically a closetoawful film but moneywise it has been doing and will continue to do great,negative
a sometimesfunny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring,negative
an orginal plot that grows old real fast,negative
one of the only 90 minute films that ive gotten bored through,negative
men in black has defied the odds,negative
when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas,negative
however i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea which summer audiences have embraced that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie,negative
tommy lee jones and will smith play two government agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society,negative
the ridiculous plot begins when an alien bug played weirdly by vincent donofrio who was so great in full metal jacket lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy thats somewhere on orions belt,negative
anyway the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy or a higher power will blow up the earth,negative
the premise is ridulous but that is not why i didnt like this film,negative
i love original plots,negative
this one had an original one,negative
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films,negative
whenever i saw donofrios bug stomp and eat people in the film it got terribly boring after a while,negative
while smiths wisecracks did fill in the gaps it wasnt enough,negative
and also i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a subplot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent they cant have contact with any humans really,negative
and here i see jones at a satellite computer watching his lover plant the garden,negative
a sentimental moment in an alien movie,negative
nice try but i dont think so,negative
it doesnt work here,negative
it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring we dont only have aliens to worry about but now we have joness conscience,negative
i came into the movie not wanting to see joness conscience but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it,negative
maybe its unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were,negative
nevertheless even though some parts are indeed funny the plot in this movie grew old and boring quick,negative
hav plenty as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film is a true story,negative
life itself is a series of true stories but most are not movie material,negative
as scripted directed and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot hav plenty limps along at best,negative
its dialog is so stilted you know what they say no women no cry,negative
that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it,negative
in the story lee plenty cherot is a 28yearold author and teaching assistant,negative
the movie which happens mainly over the new years holiday consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed,negative
since he consistently refuses caroline gooden tammi katherine jones figures that he must be gay,negative
eventually he and havilland hav savage chenoa maxwell get together proving that he wasnt gay after all just picky,negative
sexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them but he will not even kiss them,negative
hes a man who knows his mind which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute monologues,negative
filled with wealthy africanamericans the story is closest in tone to love jones which was better,negative
hav plentys story doesnt go anywhere,negative
at the end it subjects us to lee plentys new film which is a movie of the movie weve just seen but with even worse acting,negative
remember folks that as outrageous as this all seems this is a true story,negative
hav tells the camera but the problem is that its not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting,negative
hav plenty isnt so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audiences time,negative
hav plenty runs 1 32,negative
it is rated r for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers,negative
an 80year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch wearing tightfitting leather as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a pumpbitch,negative
two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them,negative
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch,negative
welcome to ready to rumble,negative
judging from the fact that pottymouth adam sandler is the reigning boxoffice comedy champion you realize albeit while shaking your head that yes there is an audience for this sort of thing,negative
ladies and gentlemen i weep for society,negative
mind you when executed with style and comic ingenuity jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel theres something about mary and a laxativeinduced attack of explosive diarrhea dumb and dumber can be extremely funny,negative
unfortunately ready to rumble is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired,negative
ready to rumble is built around the dedicated fanbase of professional wrestling,negative
which in fact sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy,negative
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves and limited to a stampede of asinine humdrum bathroom humor basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and bio dome,negative
gordie boggs david arquette and sean dawkins scott caan take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics,negative
by day they transport raw sewage,negative
by night particularly on nitro monday they pay homage to their personal hero and savior jimmy king oliver platt the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community,negative
with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title firsthand,negative
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair joe pantoliano sporting long hair and cowboy boots has other plans,negative
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page playing himself pummel the king into the tarp thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans,negative
gordie and sean are shocked rioting madly while arguing this isnt even a payper view event,negative
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a comeback attempt,negative
along the way you can expect a lot of sh jokes as well,negative
you may find something to like in ready to rumble if a you are a rasslin aficionado yourself or b you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of lowbrow comedies,negative
i welcome lowbrow humor with open arms that is if its fresh and resourceful,negative
rumble is nothing but a sloppy frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation,negative
the first halfhour is the ultimate test of patience,negative
luckily the simpleminded events pick up steam particularly with the wellchoreographed wrestling action,negative
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in varsity blues and when in the ring he does professional work,negative
but the violence is too excessive,negative
having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen harts tragic accident just last year especially with one characters dive during a cage match,negative
this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of,negative
outside the wrestling action the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term scattershot while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 with brills extensive vocabulary ranging from diddly to boob and so on,negative
the final tally i chuckled a few times groaned a lot and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105,negative
castingwise ready to rumble is an odd duck,negative
oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure,negative
hes perhaps a bit chunky but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him fatty which dampens the blow i suppose,negative
rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader the nirtoest of the nitro girls proclaims gordie but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg macho man randy savage and sting among others,negative
wcw fans are sure to appreciate these,negative
others,negative
well wont,negative
i found merit in david arquettes bountiful energy as gordie which brings me to my finishing,negative
ahhh,negative
praise for the film in ready to rumble i have discovered something even more annoying than arquettes att television commercials,negative
now theres a low blow for you,negative
i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stones any given sunday,negative
its an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rockem sockem profession of pro football,negative
unfortunately the director seems to have only one priority on his mind sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers,negative
in altering each frame with quickflash photography and dizzying inyourface editing stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics,negative
we see glimpses of greatness but any given sunday has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledygook,negative
it grows tiresome and monotonous,negative
yes stone has pulled a brian depalma,negative
matters of importance are pushed aside right from the getgo,negative
tony damato al pacino coach of the struggling miami sharks finds his team stuck in a losing rut,negative
aging quarterback cap rooney dennis quaid appears to be losing his touch and damato cant seem to ignite any passion in his squad,negative
when cap is injured on the field and after a patch of unlikely events occur thirdstring qb willie beaman jamie foxx is brought into the game,negative
once in the huddle and this becomes an ingame ritual beaman horks all over the field,negative
nerves you see,negative
eventually though the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates sparking his rise to fame in the football world the endorsements the music videos etc and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behindthescenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like,negative
and i believe it,negative
there is some intriguing insight posed but in the big scheme of things stone fumbles the ball,negative
the problem with the directors visual approach is this he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate,negative
football is an exciting game to watch but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush,negative
i guess he is mistaken,negative
any given sunday is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them,negative
many football fans including one i attended with are liable to be disappointed with the ultrastylish way stone has decided to present the game,negative
in return a threestar film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the directors tampering,negative
in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break this actually shows decent character development and interaction,negative
for instance heated returns between damato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci cameron diaz are enjoyable to watch,negative
there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory,negative
the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine aaron eckhart lauren holly annmargret and charlton heston in an extraordinarily brief appearance,negative
unfortunately too many big names are wasted a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast,negative
pacino makes some interesting progress with his character,negative
you begin to identify with coach damato and the morals he is striving for,negative
but i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics,negative
any given sunday is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique,negative
and a very distant back seat at that,negative
have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming,negative
obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment and so to finish us utterly they have now released urban legends final cut,negative
this is another scream like feature consisting merely from the recycled materials of ripoffs from the most pointless movies of all time,negative
amy jennifer morrison is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do,negative
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious universitys film program where each years best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize a virtual oneway ticket to hollywood success she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese loretta devine whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines,negative
soon enough fake and real blood starts to flow and amy is being chased around by scary killer while her cast and crew get slain one by one,negative
is the culprit the original urban legends murderer just some random psycho,negative
a member of the faculty one of her competitors for the hitchcock or is there something even more stupid going on,negative
this is another one of those tiring pointless teen slasher flicks neither scary funny or interesting,negative
it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain,negative
the body counts and screams continue to grow as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly,negative
in fact watching films like that after having watched scary movie is impossible keeping a serious face,negative
several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing without succeeding,negative
and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing,negative
its the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century,negative
how many times must we tolerate the same clich s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth,negative
it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them,negative
they are the most stupid meaningless predictable and soulless films in existence,negative
however director john ottman manages to make urban legends final cut into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre,negative
what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in scream ottman takes seriously,negative
for that reason alone it is worth a look just to realize how bad a movie can be,negative
its tough to find comparisons for such an achievement and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect,negative
even movies like lost in space and mission to mars seem spectacular in its shadow,negative
we have not seen such waste of t,negative
ime and resources since showgirls 1995,negative
no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production i came up with nothing except the way the killer was dressed,negative
here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and mariesylvie deveu that have wisely replaced the well known screammask with a very elegant fencing mask,negative
jennifer morrison stir of echoes is all right and the other actors best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script,negative
in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film with the exception of its screenplay is its portray of film schools,negative
if these graduates will be the directors of the future then hollywoods golden days are over,negative
rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment,negative
lets just hope and pray that its just an urban legend,negative
fit for a ghouls night out fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic fatuous builtin excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls,negative
being a boy i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudofeminist comingofage story,negative
fair enough,negative
ill pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 this is a nono dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass speaking variations on it wont hurt,negative
for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes,negative
this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism,negative
they dare you to look away without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children theyre mouthpieces for writerdirector catherine breillats onenote clinical politics,negative
rather than show an evenhanded evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change breillat previously responsible for the unwatchable romance wants to indulge in her hour of hate,negative
life is pain highness,negative
get used to it,negative
shed find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest,negative
for children dealing with trauma and pain is complicated,negative
to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap,negative
these wouldbe auteurs more like hauteurs havent earned the right to display suffering because they dont layer it in emotional truth as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet,negative
of course there i go again comparing her to all these better male directors,negative
i dont care,negative
gender be damned shes borderline inept,negative
braced for a kneejerk reaction from the art house crowd mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice writerdirector catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people,negative
dont be fooled,negative
this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten remembered only as cold boring philosophically arid and incompetently photographed,negative
the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence,negative
twelve years old a bundle of dough with a sour pout the superb ana s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance,negative
her character is also named ana s,negative
sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split her presence is grounded and heartbreaking,negative
its a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister 15year old elena roxane mesquida for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room,negative
in this summer cottage ana s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elenas depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance,negative
the boy in question a smug italian college kid named fernando libero de rienzo is a real piece of work claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob,negative
ana s doesnt receive any warmth from her largely absent parents who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth,negative
she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone singing songs to herself and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that its her paramour,negative
reboux commands the screen but theres only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself,negative
if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they werent so dramatically misguided,negative
this 83minute vignette is something of a horror show but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end,negative
on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late,negative
will mommy fall asleep at the wheel,negative
perhaps,negative
or maybe theres something deadlier around the corner lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl,negative
whats more she might even like it,negative
with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood breillats extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt,negative
fat girl is a bitter pill indeed,negative
aka ma soeur,negative
screened at the 2001 new york film festival feature coming soon,negative
i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago,negative
i guess my memory really sucks,negative
there is very very little that is funny in caddyshack,negative
the laughs are few and far between and what there are really arent that great,negative
caddyshack as the name implies more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club,negative
michael okeefe plays said caddy,negative
why they cast this unknown fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me,negative
the movie doesnt seem to have a real plot just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera,negative
the only real story if you can call it that was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course,negative
most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera with painfully limited success,negative
bill murray is slightly amusing in places but fairly wasted,negative
the biggest waste of all is chevy chase who didnt even crack a smile on my face with his characters lame zenlike approach to golfing,negative
there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie,negative
i guess thats what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid,negative
im not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper,negative
nothing about this movie works,negative
it wouldnt have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasnt going to fly,negative
most of the scenes just couldnt possibly be funny,negative
its as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world,negative
im sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny,negative
in reality they were painfully embarrassing to watch,negative
there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the hot babe of the movie walking by in her bikini,negative
olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl,negative
everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned,negative
maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny,negative
but for the rest of us stay the hell away from caddyshack,negative
this is the worst movie ive viewed so far in 98,negative
the avengers silly man dressed in a bowler hat woman wearing tight leathers evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits greater evil sir august de wynter wearing kilt,negative
the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast,negative
the same question was probably asked of last years stinker batman and robin,negative
i feel the production got a little too smug the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie,negative
my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed thurman and fiennes something that was a vital element of the 60s tv serial of the same name,negative
the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks but does not allow much room for character development and interaction except to perhaps grate on the viewers nerves,negative
one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality,negative
connery as sir august does not fair better than thurman or fiennes,negative
his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather mostly embarrassing and poor quality,negative
if there is a movie you would prefer never to see i believe the avengers would be a good choice,negative
for one thing you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title,negative
i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature like lightning you cant see it coming until it hits you,negative
staring george clooney arnold schwarzenegger chris odonnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone,negative
well to start this off id just like to say a couple things,negative
first is i miss michael keaton i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence,negative
not even from the first film was batman really the star though he was damn close in the first couple anyway,negative
in batman forever and now in batman robin hes almost pushed to being a bit player,negative
i cant really say if clooney who regardless was better than kilmer was a very good batman or not,negative
hes given next to nothing to do at all he might as well not have been there and it wouldnt have made much difference,negative
now joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark,negative
fine i mean granted batman returns while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes,negative
yet his bright neon campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me,negative
im usually very easy on films,negative
i loved con air and other films some critics have slammed,negative
granted that film really was paper thin cliche ridden except for one thing it was fun,negative
there is virtually no fun in this film at all,negative
i couldnt have cared less,negative
itll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing,negative
schwarzenegger is awful i mean really really bad,negative
and this is coming from a regular fan of his work,negative
i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them,negative
he talks all to often in this movie,negative
i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll,negative
i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film,negative
i liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot,negative
wyatt earp details thirtyfive years in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900,negative
after seeing the movie speed twice recently i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatts life pass before my eyes in real time,negative
this movie was boring slow boring and slow,negative
there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat,negative
the script happily womanbashes but also tries to sound like an 80s movie,negative
they cannot have it both ways,negative
i now pronounce you husband and wife,negative
sure they said that in the 1800s,negative
entrepreneur,negative
sure,negative
every bit of maleegostroking dialogue that wyatts third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it,negative
oh the script was written by two men,negative
no kidding,negative
the movie is torture to sit through,negative
the scenery is boring,negative
the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important,negative
can you say poor editing,negative
everyone looks ugly in this movie,negative
when you shoot people from under their chins they look like they have double chins,negative
kevin costner has never looked worse,negative
he should sue,negative
he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost,negative
dennis quaid is marvelous,negative
if you have to see this movie just for his performance go into the theatre at the movies halfway mark,negative
doc holliday quaids character shows up at about the 90minute mark,negative
gene hackman is very good,negative
is he in the credits,negative
i dont remember seeing his name,negative
mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatts second wife,negative
annabeth gish is good as wyatts first wife,negative
i though that jamie gertz played wyatts third wife but i later heard that her name is joanna going,negative
she looks great but her dialogue sucks,negative
she also seems way to young for costner,negative
costner seems way to old for 90 of this movie,negative
in his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old,negative
yeah right,negative
catherine ohara and jobeth williams are always good and totally wasted here,negative
this is the worst movie that i have seen in years,negative
the last action hero was better that this,negative
go see maverick if you want to see a western,negative
bullets for dennis quaids performance only,negative
you cant have any of this,negative
its all mine,negative
a twisted priest charles huevelman hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana angela zimmerly looks on uninterested,negative
an evil presence appropriately named the presence dj vivona rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him,negative
for kicks the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered,negative
when something goes wrong and one of the presences recent victims escapes the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped,negative
they enlist the help of alison ramona midgett a recent suicide victim to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the netherrealm,negative
her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed,negative
the kings sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice,negative
during the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled,negative
abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love,negative
in this new realm amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm,negative
after each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyns,negative
because of the screwup that allowed the recent escape abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself,negative
as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered,negative
if theres one thing i cant stand when i see a film its when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty,negative
films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this and now ice from the sun can be added to this list,negative
this film is essentially an 80 minute stalkandslash film following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and supposedly haunting images many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot,negative
if there arent bizarre images floating past the screen then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone,negative
compelling but ultimately not,negative
the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images,negative
the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesnt pop up until near the end of the sequence,negative
when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv,negative
at least the music in the film is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett,negative
at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing,negative
for some reason though he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance,negative
one overalled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel then theres an inbred father dwight spurgin and his two inbred children mark kettler and jennifer poirrierwallace that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half doghalf human mix with a shotgun and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds,negative
why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of rednecks when you yourself had all of these cool powers,negative
and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time,negative
i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment,negative
the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned sequence,negative
the character in question dana angela zimmely has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated,negative
a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken,negative
he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever,negative
when she starts to leave the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life walks out and makes like it wants to be crucified by her,negative
the presence starts to clap annoyingly which continues for the rest of the sequence until dana takes off with the strange creature following her,negative
when it finally catches up to her she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ,negative
the box for the film claims because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18,negative
contains nudity and graphic violence,negative
while both is certainly true there doesnt seem to be much of either in any large amounts,negative
besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump a semigraphic selfsurgery scene and two instances of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety,negative
as for nudity it is very sparse but at least we get to see angela zimmerly far and away the most attractive cast member before her body is bruised torn and bloodied by the dragging incident,negative
ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www bmovie com,negative
it has been presented in in fullframe only and the transfer for a film shot a good deal in 8mm is pretty decent,negative
besides the decent soundtrack which is also available from www bmovie com a makingof video is also available called on thin ice,negative
i havent had the opportunity to see the documentary but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed if only to see how director eric stanze director of a similar cult film called savage harvest conducted the atmosphere on set,negative
rated r for strong violence language drug use nudity and some sexuality,negative
starring wesley snipes anne archer michael chaykin donald sutherland marie matiko,negative
running time 117 minutes,negative
directed by christian duguay,negative
ive never fully understood wesley snipess career,negative
he has his ups and downs but mostly the downs,negative
his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled blade,negative
he has had his typical action movies boiling point passenger 57 but his new movie the art of war should just be called rising sun 2 the art of war cause basically its a semiremake of the same plot with a different cast and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller that is high on style and low on substance,negative
wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u n after a chinese ambassador is killed he is on the track of the killer trying to find out who it is how it happened where the killer was and what to do,negative
anne archer plays his boss type person of the u n and she has hired snipes to track down the killer,negative
well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer and is now an outlaw kidnapping a chinese woman with him and having her help him along the way,negative
all this leads to a finale that is so dumb and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb and the stunts dialogue and acting all ruin this movie,negative
wesley snipes isnt one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before,negative
the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998s blade,negative
i walked into the art of war expecting a good high octane thriller and all i got was a pile of mush,negative
the only real good thing the movie has is action and plenty of it but i noticed it is badly filmed the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on,negative
the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful that it even tries to mock the matrix laughably funny it is undeniably stupid,negative
christian duguays direction is also not that great,negative
his camera angles and sense of style are all in place but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done,negative
even the whole matrix ending wasnt even good,negative
the stunts and action are badly filmed and badly choreographed,negative
his placing of the characters and the assination of the chinese ambassador and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie,negative
anne archer who is usually good in her roles turns in a horrible job here,negative
she is sour downbeat and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue and dumb moves,negative
even donald sutherland as a costar cant save this movie from being a bust,negative
so for an overall opinion the art of war is a total waste of time,negative
its not entertaining nor exciting or even action packed,negative
it is a pointless movie and makes absolutely no sense at all,negative
if you really want to see a good version of the art of war rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind rising sun it isnt a great film either but at least its better than this,negative
david schwimmer from the television series friends stars as a sensitive and slightly neurotic single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother barbara hershey of a classmate he cant remember,negative
hello mrs robinson,negative
though quite cute as a romantic comedy the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march,negative
the characters act react and interact at halfspeed making for one excruciatingly long sit,negative
and whats with the dreary lighting,negative
co matt reeves brings some snap to the storys midsection the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for another classmate a very appealing gwyneth paltrow,negative
by this time though most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep,negative
those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepyeyed schwimmer a hound dog with a head cold who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression,negative
there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see mission to mars,negative
there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind,negative
but there are those who will not and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies 2001 a space odyssey armageddon apollo 13 the abyss close encounters of the third kind e t,negative
the extraterrestrial alien and aliens,negative
why,negative
because there is not one original idea in mission to mars,negative
all of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films,negative
if this is the sort of thing you dont mind you might like the film,negative
of course there are other reasons not to like mission to mars the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who havent used their brains in some time and who dont intend to start during the films running time,negative
mission to mars manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time,negative
the plot cribbed greatly from 2001 concerns a team sent to mars the first manned trip ever made to the red planet,negative
luke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians,negative
the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse this being nothing like the pulseemitting monolith in 2001 that one was on the moon but when they try to study it a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in 2001,negative
a rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell along for the ride,negative
after some zerogravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel,negative
now stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home,negative
after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth,negative
mission to mars is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so lets start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film,negative
thats it,negative
everything else fails,negative
the failure isnt de palmas fault hes working from an atrocious script,negative
only during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in 2001 where the rescue teams air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life,negative
a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film its just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes,negative
take it out and the plot isnt affected in any way,negative
the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ships computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh 2001 able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine,negative
why did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside,negative
shouldnt the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach,negative
why are the characters such idiots,negative
because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them,negative
all the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim its too bad you cant go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this,negative
cant we find out these things in a less grating matter like maybe in a flashback,negative
the whole film is like that,negative
the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know whats going on they must tell us exactly what were looking at every time,negative
sample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut a look theres mars astronaut b you sure thats mars,negative
astronaut a yeah thats mars all right,negative
astronaut c hey are you guys looking at mars,negative
that exchange isnt actually in mission to mars but i wouldnt be surprised if it were,negative
for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film havent learned to do something all those directors did very well show and dont tell,negative
de palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten,negative
this is mentallychallenged filmmaking they assume the audience wont get whats going on so they explain everything five times over,negative
fourthgraders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted,negative
the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent im just here to get a paycheck attitude,negative
cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines,negative
armin muellerstahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo,negative
robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance,negative
and sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavyhanded monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolenfromnolessthanthreemovies a lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and subpar cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then,negative
and of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in 2001 who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world,negative
it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slowgoing,negative
leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters,negative
supposedly were intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the onecharacterdecidesnottoreturn ending of armageddon but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning,negative
me i alternated between the two,negative
there is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over,negative
set in harlem during the great depression rival gangster families go to war over control of the numbers an illegal gambling lottery,negative
runners take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings,negative
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen cicely tyson who is challenged by dutch schulz tim roth a ruthless hoodlum,negative
by turning against the queen dutch defies his partner the infamous lucky luciano andy garcia who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace,negative
the queens army strengthens when an acquaintance ellsworth bumpy johnson lawrence fishburne is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her,negative
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt on himself and the queen and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion,negative
bumpys reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch,negative
bloody gang warfare ensues,negative
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign,negative
his new army questions his methods,negative
his girlfriend vanessa l williams and the queen disagree with his violent solutions,negative
most importantly in his eyes dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him,negative
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it,negative
this movie is not original at all,negative
in fact i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and arguably the best gangster movie of all time the godfather,negative
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit why not borrow from a lesser known movie say millers crossing,negative
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself,negative
here are just some of the major similarities i stopped counting at 10,negative
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader,negative
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop,negative
wife or girlfriend questions her partners murderous activities and leaves him,negative
high ranking officer betrays the leader,negative
blood relative of the leader murdered,negative
war erupting between the families,negative
highranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members,negative
new leader runs family differently from previous leader,negative
large meeting with all families involved,negative
the setup in this movie is done rather well,negative
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of runners sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery,negative
this was the way of life in harlem and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table,negative
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work,negative
i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry violent dutch and the calm patient lucky,negative
after about the 3040 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing one after the other and in short order,negative
it was a huge distraction and an insult to my intelligence,negative
who was the screenwriter kidding here,negative
some of the individual performances were well done,negative
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role,negative
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain much like his roles in the cook the thief his wife and her lover and rob roy,negative
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows,negative
a couple of coincidences is one thing over a dozen is an insult,negative
directed by bill duke,negative
ellsworth bumpy johnson lawrence,negative
fishburne dutch schultz tim,negative
roth lucky luciano andy,negative
garcia the queen cicely tyson francine hughes vanessa,negative

written by randy turgeon january 22 1998,negative
hey ive got a great idea for a movie,negative
ok here it is well get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so,negative
whats that,negative
sounds too boring,negative
ok how about this then we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours but half of them are angry looks and half of them are im in pain,negative
looks,negative
whats that,negative
that still doesnt sound funny to you,negative
how about if we through in some ewwwww,negative
looks,negative
still not funny,negative
if you answered no that doesnt sound funny then ding ding ding,negative
youre absolutely correct,negative
for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple played by tim allen and kirstie alley who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant wayne knight best know as newman on tvs seinfeld gets them in trouble for tax evasion,negative
what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell,negative
what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs,negative
namely talent,negative
backing up the married couple is brad and caroline sexton allen and alley a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else but in reality are on the brink of divorce,negative
just as their marriage seems to be hanging from its final thread brad discovers that his accountant bob lachman knight has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sextons names,negative
the irs catches on but since everything points back to the sextons and not lachman there is nothing much to do,negative
except run away and join an amish community,negative
first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckleoutloud moments and even some decent laughs here and way over there but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that youll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn,negative
alley is absolutely unwatchable and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade which i inform you was total b s,negative
allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons nor are they very convincing as an amish couple,negative
this entire movie is one bad illconceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning,negative
the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing,negative
its such a trite stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast noticing that theyre all predominantly tv figures were probably the only ones they could get,negative
bryan spicers directing doesnt help one bit either,negative
in fact listing spicers filmography which includes the first power rangers movie and the big screen adaption of mchales navy is more of an insult than a r sum,negative
now that ive pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground i will let you in on the best thing about it,negative
it bumped seven films up a notch on my worst of 1997 movie list,negative
thats right thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the years worst six films are now not seemingly as bad and a smile like yours previously inhabiting the number ten spot now doesnt have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list,negative
if you look at it in that respect for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all,negative
i feel sorry for the financial backers of waterworld which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made at 172 million and is also one of the stupidest boy did they get ripped off,negative
in fact this film is not really a movie but more of an amusement park ride with a plot,negative
its not even just another case of cliches strung together well it is that too its something thats painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws,negative
kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half fish,negative
he is an on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted,negative
hes referred to as the mariner but they the meaner would have been a more appropriate title because hes cold rigid and strict and hes supposed the be the good guy,negative
he docks at a small floating village of sorts,negative
he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters,negative
first we meet one of the villains then the soontobe heroine a child prodigy a wacky inventor and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today but also some of the lowtech tools used by pirates and vikings,negative
immediately the films biggest flaw is apparent are these people primitive or highly advanced,negative
it doesnt seem like anyone can read yet they have skidoos and airplanes,negative
how are these things powered,negative
and if they have airplanes couldnt they just keep flying until they reached dry land,negative
also if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things,negative
im sorry im all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us,negative
there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology so why mix the two together,negative
it doesnt make any sense,negative
there really isnt much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything,negative
the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child enola mojorino has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to dryland,negative
who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out,negative
we never get an answer just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland,negative
to make a long boring stupid and just plain bad story short the mariner escapes with a woman named helen tripplehorn and enola,negative
they sail for a long time encountering some strange people in the process and fight off the smokers as lead by the idiot villain deacon hopper who kidnaps enola,negative
the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons rescuing enola and bringing them all to salvation how original,negative
even with all its special effects action and adventure this film is boring,negative
not a single character is likable therefore neither is the plot,negative
dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholsons joker while costner just plain rips,negative
still waterworld is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it,negative
i just hope they dont make a sequel,negative
what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie,negative
a better question what would inspire a studio to produce said movie,negative
if you have an answer let me know,negative
foolish the new movie written by and starring master p is a jawdroppingly horrible film one with no redeeming value socially cinematically or otherwise,negative
comedically it has some potential but only in its standup comedy moments which i can turn on comedy central for,negative
master p stars as fifty dollah beat that as a mobster i think who is trying to start a comedy with his little brother foolish eddie griffin,negative
but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss played by andrew dice clay for the very first time entertaining a stubborn club owner and family problems the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger eberts idiot plot if everyone here wasnt an idiot there would be no problem,negative
so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names,negative
not a hell of a lot,negative
as i have mentioned master p cannot act or write,negative
he acts like the rapper that he is,negative
the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro,negative
as for his script well i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience,negative
if you havent yet figured it out that is not saying much,negative
costar eddie griffin really the star of the show is quite a different story,negative
the fact of the matter is that griffin whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network is an extremely talented comedian standup and otherwise,negative
he has much in common with chris tucker rush hour money talks in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips,negative
he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity to the extent which that can be done and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie,negative
and indeed i laughed at a few standup scenes here but from a featurelength movie i expect more,negative
foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters,negative
every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers foolish blurts out towards his jewelrysporting sibling you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car to which i said a bit too loudly for the occasion huh after getting slightly upset with his wife,negative
believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hardearned 8,negative
youll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you dont have cable,negative
eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative although offensive yarn but everyone else should stay the hell away,negative
137,negative
watching the movie i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup cute n cuddly computergenerated monkey,negative
if the monkey died the movie got an extra half star,negative
alas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs,negative
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars,negative
thats pretty generous considering the movies camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek,negative
when will robinson jack johnson teaches his pet robot about friendship you are actually supposed to buy it,negative
so why such a seemingly high rating,negative
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage,negative
first we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater,negative
the sound and screen kicked ass,negative
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did and i dont necessarily mean that in a good way,negative
also there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons or getting caught up in the movies tension,negative
i even liked the computergenerated settings,negative
i usually prefer to see models or sets but the cg was more detailed than ive seen in a lot of movies it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities,negative
also gary oldman is never a bad actor even though he is typecast as a villain,negative
william hurt isnt too bad either,negative
neither actor had a great role but their performances were watchable,negative
and perhaps i shouldnt admit this but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood,negative
there is very little swearing or blood there is a strong moral message saccharine though it is there is a bit of romance whose culmination after 2 hours is a real kiss no sex,negative
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six,negative
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space but at the time they were manna from heaven,negative
that type of moviemaking is a lost art,negative
now for the bad news,negative
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue,negative
its squeakyclean family fun trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction,negative
you better hold on to your joystick is one such line,negative
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign,negative
second worst and closely related is the screenplay,negative
the storys exposition takes place at a press conference which allows the writers to explain whats happening with the least amount of creativity effort or interest,negative
once the story gets going i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while but on the whole the situations that arise are silly and contrived,negative
when gary oldman easily reprograms wills pet robot to kill the robinsons my friend summed it up perfectly he flipped the switch to evil,negative
then theres the tone of the movie,negative
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson,negative
then it could be an adventure movie,negative
theyre mostly right except that johnson will wasnt a good enough actor to carry it off,negative
still that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination,negative
just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesnt mean that we have to bow to a promise keepers notion of whos the center of a family,negative
many quality family films have been made with a nontraditional family structure fly away home comes to mind to much better effect,negative
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie,negative
in star wars the rebels were the good guys,negative
we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system,negative
in lost in space the rebels are the bad guys a terrorist force that must be killed crushed and silenced so that our children may live free,negative
that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists,negative
finally a few specific details deserve criticism,negative
the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056,negative
why,negative
why bother saying what year this is,negative
just tell us its the future,negative
i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997,negative
setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it wont be timeless not that this movie was really in the running anyway,negative
then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole,negative
this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunnys barber chair and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers havent learned a thing about ergonomics,negative
one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed it made lost in space look cool,negative
the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and out of context made it sound hip,negative
this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie,negative
but if thats the best part of the movie i cant in good conscience recommend it,negative
still if you get stuck seeing it as we did you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance think of liking bad movies as a child and bring along your bad movie bingo cards,negative
in the 13th warrior arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the kings old lady,negative
with his translator screen legend omar sharif in a small role ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen vikings,negative
he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king,negative
a messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance,negative
a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons twelve northmen and one outsider,negative
thus ahmed becomes the 13th warrior,negative
on the trip ahmed manages to learn the vikings language by listening to their fireside conversations,negative
a bit farfetched its true but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting,negative
ahmed whos called ibn by the vikings forms friendships with herger the joyous dennis storh i and the viking leader buliwyf vladimir kulich,negative
when they arrive in the other kingdom the thirteen warriors discover that theyre facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves,negative
hereafter most of the movie is battle scenes the cannibals attack the vikings the vikings attack the cannibals the cannibals attack the,negative
well you get the idea,negative
just to add some action theres also a viking vs viking duel,negative
other movies insert scenes between the fights these scenes are called character development,negative
i suspect that the 13th warrior had a better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tagteam direction,negative
the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan youll notice a lot of similarities between warrior and mctiernans predator including the chittering jungle sounds,negative
somewhere along the line mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over,negative
crichton whose novel eaters of the dead is the basis for warrior has directed a small assortment of goofy sciencefiction thrillers westworld coma looker runaway,negative
their result of their consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie,negative
perhaps what the 13th warrior needs more than anything else is a villain,negative
the eaters of the dead are a faceless mob in blackface,negative
they have no personality and by the end they dont even seem particularly threatening,negative
the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression,negative
mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain it was his die hard that made villains seem fun and attracted bigname stars to the evil roles in action films,negative
the 13th warrior suffers from a lack of vision,negative
it wants to be predator meets braveheart meets the magnificent seven meets dances with wolves,negative
with so many competing goals all it can do is echo what it might have been,negative
it might have been a satisfying action film,negative
it might have been a beautifullyrendered medieval epic,negative
it might have been a thoughtprovoking examination of the meeting of cultures,negative
what a shame it turned out to be nothing in particular,negative
bottom line if you want to see antonio swing his sword rent the mask of zorro,negative
if anything stigmata should be taken as a warning against releasing similarlythemed films relatively close to one another,negative
of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst,negative
i suppose i should have seen this coming,negative
after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but wasnt anything id lose sleep over,negative
clearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping,negative
is it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtvinfluenced tripe i have seen in a long while,negative
no not really,negative
patricia arquette plays frankie page a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globetrotting mother,negative
as it turns out the rosary belonged to a recentlydeceased brazilian priest,negative
the priests church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue,negative
father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue,negative
his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ,negative
father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story considering shes an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on,negative
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church,negative
as it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of a fifth gospel before they were excommunicated,negative
the new rupert wainwright music video,negative
i mean film stigmata is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse,negative
indeed it would have been good if it were a music video because its only interesting for about five minutes,negative
im not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slowmotion doubleexposure and extreme closeups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he has been to film school,negative
his camera trickery is interesting for a little while but eventually it becomes headacheinducing,negative
what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue such as it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see,negative
look at what i can do,negative
im an excellent director,negative
maybe then hed explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slowmotion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary,negative
if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery i didnt see it,negative
just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story here comes a doubleexposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever,negative
arrrrrrrghhhh,negative
then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother me if stigmata had a story or characters that were remotely engaging,negative
though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script,negative
where are plot continuity and character development when you need them,negative
case in point frankie page is the character that i assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we arent given any back story on her character or any reason to like her,negative
the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hardworking hairdresser who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and shes kind of cute so lets start the bleeding,negative
the fact that shes clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesnt help either,negative
according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back,negative
go clubbing,negative
sure that makes sense,negative
arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so onedimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking,negative
scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable,negative
even though frankie pages life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon,negative
even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advances,negative
father andrews religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic,negative
as for pryce he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle ill get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded,negative
trust me im not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain,negative
whats worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible,negative
first of all the film doesnt even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary,negative
how come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata,negative
actually im not sure what frankie was posessed by,negative
supposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit i think,negative
which one is it,negative
the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants to use this time,negative
furthermore the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrapup and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church,negative
if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas youll find that it is not being suppressed by the church as the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library,negative
theres nothing the catholics need to worry about though,negative
stigmatas religion is so offbase that it cant be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church,negative
if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone allout and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting,negative
im not catholic in fact i don t care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means,negative
its rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as stigmata does,negative
it s not thoughtprovoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends to be,negative
im not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story,negative
maybe its an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever,negative
the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over,negative
like so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill,negative
so much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us to pick out the films many flaws,negative
im also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earthshattering,negative
when we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns on their first day of sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing,negative
the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it,negative
when considering david finchers latest film the game four words come to mind,negative
dont believe the hype,negative
this michael douglas vehicle from the director of seven isnt nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe,negative
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept aided no doubt by the riveting trailer where a jaded millionaire douglas is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy,negative
this isnt simply virtual reality,negative
this is real life with a deadly twist,negative
on his 48th birthday nicholas van orton douglas is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother conrad sean penn,negative
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother,negative
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services,negative
they make your life fun conrad tells him,negative
nicholas humors his brother telling him hell call but its clear he has no time for any foolish fantasy roleplaying as he calls it,negative
then for reasons that are never really made clear nicholas decides to go to crs and see what theyre all about,negative
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have,negative
nevertheless when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client the weird things start happening,negative
of course when weve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time what else should we expect,negative
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands,negative
one of those films basic instinct came from the creative minds of writer joe eszterhas and director paul verhoeven,negative
the premise of the game is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film total recall,negative
in that case the premise was implanting someone elses memories as a way to enhance ones own life through a dream vacation,negative
yet in both films the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience,negative
we live the adventure along with the protagonist reacting to each twist and turn,negative
in theory the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isnt,negative
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride when the truth is finally revealed,negative
now for those of you who forgot let me say this again,negative
dont believe the hype,negative
the game is not a thrilling roller coaster ride,negative
as a suspensethriller it doesnt do much but spin in circles,negative
by the third reel i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot,negative
is it any wonder douglas wont be able to resist the charms of a mysterious potentially lifethreatening blonde ever heard of glenn close,negative
no well how about sharon stone,negative
thought so,negative
if anything in this film surprises you at all i would guess you havent seen that many films,negative
there is no suspense here,negative
trust me i looked hard to find some,negative
i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations,negative
fincher aims for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas,negative
there are those that might say the game is not intended to be viewed literally,negative
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film,negative
the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues,negative
there is a moment early in the film where van orton realizing his game has begun smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out whos in on the whole thing,negative
he is charged by his paranoia,negative
he is looking at the world through new eyes,negative
it is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film,negative
from there on the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us,negative
any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device,negative
at the outset were told each game is tailored to the individual,negative
ultimately this game is supposed to work like a crucible trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire proving his soul,negative
yet as douglas endures his personal gauntlet were given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is,negative
i wanted to like this film more than i did,negative
i look at it as just anothergreat idea poorly realized,negative
i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didnt mean we were seeing what was really happening,negative
bryan singers the usual suspects for one a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas,negative
also there is the underrated jacobs ladder with tim robbins a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism,negative
here are two examples of films that dont simply manipulate for manipulations sake,negative
there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place,negative
one major issue that comes up in the game is whether or not the whole illusion is just a highly sophisticated con game,negative
well i can tell you right now after youve spent your 7 dollars you may be asking yourself the same thing,negative
synopsis in sooner than you think america the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs,negative
a dangerous criminal however attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them,negative
comments so what do an exgangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common,negative
why theyre all members of blade squad an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms rollerblades and jetpacks,negative
they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james camerons aliens,negative
yes its blade squad the fox networks wednesday night movie of the week,negative
this movie marking its dubious world premiere today curiously has a number of guest stars,negative
how can a movie have guest stars,negative
you may ask,negative
well blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie,negative
blade squad is dumb,negative
blade squad is loud,negative
blade squad is obnoxious,negative
blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a longlived tv series,negative
why not,negative
after all television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars knight rider fast helicopters airwolf and super fast motorcycles street hawk and viewers have eaten it up in the past,negative
so why not crimefighters with jetpowered roller blades,negative
to be honest as a madefortv presentation blade squad is at least watchable,negative
the film has a relatively large cast of characters a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script and enough action sequences to keep one halfinterested,negative
id imagine adolescent males probably the target audience of this turkey would get a kick out of it,negative
i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad,negative
i can remember liking airwolf and street hawk when i was 10 or 11,negative
and although this isnt saying much blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on the insipidly awful generation x a huge disappointment considering the comic books terrific twoyear beginning,negative
but i digress,negative
despite its limited appeal blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series,negative
one it suffers from mtv syndrome a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewers senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background,negative
oh yeah dylans knockin on heavens door and bowies im afraid of americans are used here in rather poor taste,negative
two blade squad needs a new crew for the sound,negative
the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end,negative
characters dialogue at times sounded choppy and unintelligible,negative
during one important scene a song played loudly in the background,negative
when a character spoke the songs volume dropped but did not disappear,negative
as soon as that character finished speaking the songs volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke,negative
this sounds trivial im sure but it distracted me immensely,negative
finally this is commercial television,negative
foul language is not allowed typically on commercial television,negative
thus dont use foul language in a madefortv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner,negative
in an early scene of the film for example the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets,negative
when the good guy spouts out a bad word a driver conveniently honks his cars horn offscreen to muffle the word out,negative
in a seinfeld episode this technique proved funny here it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably,negative
perhaps future writers if a show is spun out of the movie could take a cue from marvel comics 2099 series of comics,negative
make up a bunch of new bad words for the future,negative
this way you dont need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language,negative
compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp,negative
when compared to say a movie studio film blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials bs,negative
review written august 12 1998,negative
1 he doesnt have a hardtodecipher accent 2 he doesnt always speak in a monotone and 3,negative
his face doesnt always wear the same impassive expression,negative
in short the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad but too bad to be good,negative
unfortunately the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle firestorm which is just plain awful,negative
one of the most glaring problems with long who made his acting debut in john woos broken arrow is that hes so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery,negative
as ace firefighter jesse graves long is supposed to be playing a biggerthanlife action hero the kind of he man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers,negative
unfortunately despite the best efforts of firsttime director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costners work in the postman look stark jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy,negative
to put it kindly this is not a wellwritten motion picture,negative
firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich s which taken together form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot,negative
the only reason this film is getting one star instead of something lower is that most of the fire sequences are realistic and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively,negative
were introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people,negative
during this sequence our big burly hero proves that hes also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog yes the dog lives from being broiled alive,negative
flashforward a year,negative
now our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins real actor scott glenn,negative
but this day our big burly heros first in charge isnt going to be businessasusual,negative
a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom,negative
led by randy earl shaye william forsythe the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border,negative
along the way they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress suzy amis,negative
eventually our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire rescue the damsel in distress defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die and restore order to the galaxy,negative
firestorms director dean semler is a former cinematographer he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves so its no surprise that the film looks good,negative
unfortunately thats firestorms lone asset and it falters near the end when computergenerated special effects fill up the screen,negative
these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game,negative
the action sequences which include a variety of chases are occasionally interesting but never invigorating,negative
everyone including long appears to be going through the motions,negative
there isnt a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end unless you count the forest fire which generates some heat,negative
as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die william forsythe lacks panache,negative
hes worse than a generic bad guy hes a boring generic bad guy who doesnt have any snappy oneliners to hurl at our big burly hero,negative
my advice to scott glenn absolute power and suzy amis titanic is to accidentally forget this film the next time theyre making out a resume,negative
theres some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list,negative
at least i hope there arent 10 worse films than this,negative
and i know i wasnt the only one who really disliked this movie,negative
as the audience was filing out of the screening i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments,negative
the general consensus seemed to be that although the movie sucked the promotional key ring was cool,negative
the problem is that fox wont be giving out key rings to regular moviegoers so that nixes any reason to see firestorm,negative
the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits,negative
the rationale is sound but in many cases of this and recent years the sequel is a shoddy product thats exposed for the cashmilking vehicle it really is,negative
last years speed 2 and scream 2 as well as this years species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory,negative
in some cases a sequel can even discredit its predecessor as with the latest neoslasher flick i still know what you did last summer,negative
whatever uniqueness the original mightve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller,negative
julie james jennifer love hewitt and ray bronson freddie prinze jr are back from the original to star in i still know reprising their roles in typical fashion,negative
julie and ray experience a rather predictable fallingout at the beginning of the movie leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson matthew settle,negative
will and julie hit it off and along with friends karla brandy norwood and tyrell mekhi phifer the foursome heads off to a radio stationgiveaway vacation in the tropics,negative
unfortunately things arent so peachy once they arrive and with a regularity you could set your watch by the infamous fisherman muse watson is back with his hook,negative
its another bloody showdown complete with cliffhanger ending,negative
theres not much thats original about i still know and with the market saturated by genx thrillers like this one its unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel,negative
for diehard fans of the genre this will be required viewing material but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer,negative
the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isnt heightened by skillful scripting or camera work but rather a tense stringbased score and manipulative editing,negative
the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments,negative
much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point,negative
the whole reason the plot exists julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station is a dead giveaway lessening suspense and creating a hurryupandwait timing problem,negative
and whereas the killers identity mightve been a question in the first movie its almost a given here which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically,negative
three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as the killer,negative
theyre almost used to it and the performances show it not hewitt nor prinze nor brandy nor phifer give a decent show,negative
and so in the end its left wide open for a third movie and most likely a brand new supporting cast,negative
god help us,negative
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet vulnerable irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness,negative
the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo played by sookyin lee as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible,negative
alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene,negative
this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland,negative
one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa,negative
she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window,negative
next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild adam beach,negative
he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating,negative
ben gets emotionally involved with alessa,negative
as alessa so delicately puts it we were bosom buddies now were fuck buddies,negative
but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor,negative
the real problem with the film seems to be helen lees inability to decide what she wants to be saying,negative
she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa,negative
alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients,negative
this appears to be a high profile and wellpaid job,negative
we are supposed to care about alessas feelings but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father,negative
alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint,negative
this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up doublezero,negative
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
certainly no one would rent ed woods glen or glenda,negative
expecting to see a good movie but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didnt know was possible,negative
in fact woods infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison,negative
watching glen or glenda,negative
i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together as a result it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious,negative
the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary with endless repetitive narration about transvestites how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriends clothes without being able to wear them how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals and how the main character is as it reminds us probably half a dozen times not half man and half woman but man and woman at the same time,negative
the camera work is terribleoccasionally the camera lingers on say a closed door while the characters talk offscreen or inexplicably zooms in on someones ear or nose,negative
wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage which leads to voicedover nonsequiturs like yes our world is a busy and frightening place with so many people driving their automobiles,negative
finally there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankensteinstyle laboratory delivering pointless lines such as people,negative
all with their own thoughts,negative
their own ideas,negative
while lightning crackles quasiominously overhead,negative
had wood continued in this vein glen or glenda,negative
probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horrormovie touch,negative
unfortunately he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script,negative
pull the string,negative
pull the string,negative
announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears,negative
there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns this time warning us beware,negative
beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door,negative
it eats little boys,negative
and puppy dogs tails,negative
and big fat snails,negative
a bizarre nightmare sequence which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid ensues during which finds his fiance trapped under a fallen treein the living room,negative
someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister green dragon but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series appears to be orchestrating all this though the film is far from clear on this point to put it kindly,negative
near the end of this sceneand here i must confess that wood lost me completelyis a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music,negative
after this scene ends not a moment too soon glen or glenda,negative
returns to its documentary style but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone,negative
the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism but at that point it didnt matter much what happened,negative
as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over glen or glenda,negative
had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen,negative
i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could it still might not match glen or glenda,negative
for sheer cinematic disaster,negative
i am giving this movie an f but im not sure that quite does it justice,negative
the cartoon is way better,negative
thats the bottom line on disneys incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature,negative
the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic home alone with puppies and not much else,negative
when production of this remake was announced the big question seemed to be why,negative
the original cartoon still works so whats the point,negative
the answer it appears is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign,negative
the story for those of you who missed childhood is simple,negative
two dalmatians pongo and perdy fall in love at first sight,negative
they drag their human pets together and in a short time both couples marry,negative
the heavenly matchups turn chaotic when pongo and perdys newborn pups are stolen their dognapping engineered by the evil cruella devil who wants them for their pelts,negative
everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies,negative
in the original movie the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities,negative
we also could hear them talk which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film the dogs view of humans as their pets,negative
in the new version the dogs are mute and expressionless,negative
hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks,negative
while he drew the desired aww theyre so cute reaction from the audience it was quickly followed by several people whispering i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dogs heads to get them licking like that,negative
the canines lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little,negative
joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles,negative
in previous films daniels successfully played off his white bread persona,negative
in something wild he revealed the rebellious thrillseeker beneath his neutral demeanor,negative
in terms of endearment his hapless appearance masked a cold manipulative womanizer,negative
here he and richardson are so consistently bland that its a wonder their images even stick to the film,negative
glenn close however has no problems establishing a distinct personality,negative
as the villainous icon cruella devil she tears up the screen in a deliciously overthetop performance,negative
close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself,negative
with a twotone fright wig red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature,negative
shes clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon and her wicked glee is infectious,negative
when she spits out lines like youve won the battle but im about to win the wardrobe,negative
the film comes briefly to life,negative
101 dalmatians is crammed with john hughes typical heavyhanded approach to comedy,negative
after an ingenuous opening showing pongos morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park a little slapstick goes a long way but hughes just keeps laying it on,negative
the second half of the film where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen is a tedious home alone clone with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy scratchy cartoon including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence,negative
101 dalmatians has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick bland characters and unconvincing animatronic raccoons highfiving one another,negative
rent the cartoon,negative
its actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i the phantom menace because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy,negative
and no i really dont feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the boxoffice,negative
really i dont,negative
not at all,negative
the plot has been done before a mysterious unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town causing confusion for everyone who reads it,negative
the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen kate capshaw and by the way what is it with bookstore owner main characters,negative
in the past year and a half weve seen them in life is beautiful youve got mail this movie and the upcoming notting hill who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore,negative
she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from and comes to the incorrect conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott,negative
he reading the letter himself assumes that she wrote it for him,negative
after a while they fall in love well duh,negative
kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman tom selleck,negative
to add to her turmoil her mother shows up blythe danner who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 and her trusted bookstore manager deadpan ellen degeneres quits,negative
supporting characters arent called supporting for nothing,negative
their purpose isnt just to move the plot along theyre also supposed to give the storyline a backbone,negative
to do this they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting,negative
rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed dull cardboard secondary characters especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonists various interactions with them,negative
this is the love letters damning error,negative
capshaws character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely onedimensional,negative
because of that the love letter is awkward and insincere,negative
even worse its a bore,negative
i liked capshaw and her helen but everyone else is painfully fake undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist,negative
there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either and besides degeneres wisecracks theres little that is even a little amusing,negative
this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter hosun chan does a good job of portraying helens yearnings and various subtle complexities,negative
but its far from profound,negative
there isnt a common theme running through the proceedings thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless,negative
really this is a harmless little movie its far from an abomination and its not torturous to sit through,negative
but bad it is,negative
awful it also is,negative
the love letter is a failure and an inane failure at that,negative
1999 eugene novikov137,negative
in this remake of the 1954 japanese monster film godzilla is transformed into a jurassic park copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town,negative
although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while it gets old fast,negative
the film often makes no sense a severalhundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels sports secondrate effects the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen lame jokes mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny horrendous acting even matthew broderick is dull and an unbelievable love story why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillos character,negative
there are other elements of the film that fall flat but going on would just be a waste of good words,negative
only for diehard creature feature fans this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door,negative
i couldnt,negative
michael redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both fear and loathing and godzilla in the same evening,negative
chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from you either find his helium voice crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying,negative
i think i fall into the former category im one of the few who thought his turn in the fifth element as a prancing princelike deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating but his new vehicle money talks just doesnt do him service,negative
tucker is good in the movie and this is the kind of film that if people see it could make him a big star but hes also really the only thing good about the movie,negative
in fact if you see money talks it should shock you beyond recognition that two of toy story s writers penned the sloppy script,negative
tuckers role here is that of franklin hatchett a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell charlie sheen,negative
after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard gerard ismael,negative
but villards thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist franklin is allowed to escape as well but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that for some reason or another is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo,negative
the local media mistakenly puts the prison breakout blame on franklin which is where james comes back into the picture,negative
he makes a deal to protect franklin if in turn franklin gives him an exclusive interview,negative
this means james must present his new friend in the stickiest of situations a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace heather locklear also attended by her uberrich parents veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino,negative
and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james,negative
this aint no buddy movie claim the print ads,negative
yeah right,negative
actually for the better part of oh 20 minutes it appears money talks has the momentum to cover entertaining ground and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker,negative
this is tuckers first leading role and if you imagine a slightly lankier africanamerican jim carrey with a reliance on wild rrated raunch rather than pg13 physical comedy you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role,negative
but you realize all too quickly that tuckers overstated liveliness is the only thing money talks has going for it,negative
and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make,negative
its all too easy to pick out everything wrong with money talks,negative
the plot is recycled buddybuddy comedythriller tripe that seemed overused even when nothing to lose employed it last month,negative
everything is paintbynumbers especially the los angeles coliseum finale which finds not one not two but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers,negative
the villains as many as there are are dull,negative
certain story elements are too coincidental,negative
and too much of the films dramatic agenda is played too straight,negative
a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklins true identity you brought a killer into my parents house,negative
is extremely silly,negative
you get the picture,negative
obviously i did not have a pleasant experience at money talks,negative
but the people around me appeared to be having a riproaring good time one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health,negative
but tucker at least for me is a pretty funny guy and aces the movies best scene where franklin passes himself off as vic damones son at james and graces engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics,negative
tuckers audience and he does have one will probably like money talks,negative
those who he irritates however will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails,negative
postchasing amy a slew of lovetriangle movies this month we have kissing a fool costarring amys own lee and april brings us the object of my affection which may as well be titled chasing allan for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate,negative
to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it that film stars schwimmers friend jennifer aniston,negative
if only kevin smith could write them all,negative
schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max who falls in love with his best friend jay lee s book editor samantha avital a mere twentyfour hours after meeting her,negative
they are soon engaged and max because of his own raging libido grows suspicious of samanthas fidelity,negative
he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book to test her,negative
the trouble is jay might be secretly in love with her,negative
to stretch this flat sitcom premise to feature length the plot is framed by a climactic wedding at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular talethe events leading up to the nuptialsto an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend,negative
hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue and lee poor lee is miscast,negative
so hysterically funny in chasing amy here he is forced to repress his comic instincts to swear to yell to talk about oral sex,negative
the scripts idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a sensitive man and then show him drinking pepto bismol when hes stewing over his girl trouble,negative
as for avital an israeli actress she is warm and sweet but we dont know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things,negative
she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer who plays schwimmers assistant and personal temptress turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo,negative
there are a handful a smattering of good scenes in kissing a fool,negative
i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club during which jay gets up and asks has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her,negative
over and over until hes booted off stage,negative
there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything thats on the page,negative
kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night jokemachine friends that spawned schwimmers movie career so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back,negative
the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what its about and why its good or bad,negative
i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this but i after having seen get carter i really cant tell you what its about although i could go on and on about how and why its a bad movie,negative
get carter falls into that category of movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room,negative
you might call them the steven claude van snipes school of mediocre thrillers,negative
you know the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights shootouts and car chases but really light on plot and character development,negative
they have stories where the socalled hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight chase or shoot at,negative
sylvester stallone stars as jack carter a las vegasbased mob enforcer who returns home for his brothers funeral,negative
he believes his brother richie was taken out and didnt die from a dwi accident,negative
carters one of the most cliche badasses ever captured on celluloid,negative
his face alone is pretty intimidating and theres quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his ramboontestosteronetherapy voice,negative
stallones performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesnt realize hes mocking himself,negative
the actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death,negative
hes in a town thats not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well,negative
mickey rourke costars as one of these characters a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman,negative
theres also another plot involving richies mistress a secret cdrom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carters stillliving relatives,negative
im rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible,negative
i could just rip the screenplay to shreds plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all,negative
i dont like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally,negative
yes get carter is just that complicated and complex,negative
and whats worse is that its not this intricate to make it seem smart like the usual suspects for example just the opposite,negative
you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didnt remember what had already happened and didnt figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax,negative
all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another asking them what they know getting information and then realizing that if he wasnt a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes,negative
although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another,negative
making a movie entirely about criminals doesnt necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters,negative
mel gibson starred in payback a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldnt help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter,negative
so ultimately get carter fails for pretty much every selling point it has,negative
carter is not a likable character and you really dont care if he gets revenge or not,negative
the action sequences are not at all exciting or original,negative
the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all cmon you know whos going to win every brawl and shootout and car chase,negative
in the end you dont feel nearly satisfied with the results,negative
the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible,negative
the city is never mentioned by name but i assume its seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and its always raining,negative
welcome to your ohso typical sequel,negative
it tries to be twice as big as its predecessor yet ends up twice as shallow,negative
shallow hmm now theres an idea,negative
maybe if the illfated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better,negative
the first thing that struck me and,negative
surprised me was that the camera work for the opening sequence anyway was terrible,negative
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet very,negative
different to the original movie,negative
the characters,negative
well not many of the characters actually had characters but heres a rundown,negative
annie who was the highlight of the the original must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie,negative
why,negative
because somethings got to account for her losing that many iq points,negative
even though annie wasnt exactly a rocket scientist in speed here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall,negative
for instance after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people cant get ut till she gets the chainsaw out of their faces bang,negative
bang bang,negative
in point of fact sandras character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules who constantly has to be rescued,negative
jason patric,negative
all i can say is bring back keanu,negative
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump but,negative
thats one more tree stump than jason has,negative
i dont think he changed facial expressions all movie jason smile for the cameras,negative
now frown i said frown oh you are bang,negative
bang bang,negative
wooden just doesnt describe this guys performance but itll have to do,negative
the bad guy ahh william,negative
dafoe theres a bright move,negative
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic body of evidence,negative
yes that is sarcasm,negative
his wide eyed maniac of a character doesnt start out too bad but,negative
goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses,negative
in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage even though he already has the money and can escape bang,negative
bang,negative
though id like to give this movie a double thumbs down there were some nice sequences,negative
considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars youd hope thered be at least a couple,negative
the real eyepopper for me even though it was given away in the trailer bang,negative
bang was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker,negative
this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was completely,negative
computer generated,negative
wow i,negative
dont think ive ever seen a cg model look so real before,negative
the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of speed,negative
this lackofspeed problem affects many sequences,negative
such as the oil tanker part it was oh no were going to hit the oil tanker,negative
20 minutes later oh no were going to hit the oil tanker,negative
20 min you,negative
get the point,negative
this movie failed simply because it didnt live up to its name there,negative
was very little feeling of speed,negative
in the original movie the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive in this movie it felt more like well people were gonna run into that there island in a few hours i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i cant turn off the engines im,negative
passing the cafeteria on the way can i get anybody anything,negative
the ending of this movie really is terrible,negative
even though it features what ive since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie it just doesnt work at all,negative
the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic but surprise,negative
surprise it just takes waaaaay too long,negative
it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped,negative
one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town around 25 people are killed by the ship and,negative
theres only 15 or so people left on the ship,negative
so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering the audience is sitting back and thinking wait a sec this is a happy moment because,negative
bang bang,negative
then there was the dog i,negative
almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris,negative
putting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche every,negative
movie seems to have a dogindanger sequence volcano dantes peak independence day daylight twister,negative
lost world etc,negative
etc,negative
this movie is a perfect example of how not to make a sequel,negative
director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one backtoback and see if he realises where he went wrong,negative
if you have ever seen fox tvs special car chase programs youll have a good idea about the content of ronin the new action thriller from director john frankenheimer,negative
the film involves a mysterious briefcase that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on,negative
an irish women dierdre played by the truman shows natascha mcelhone hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase,negative
among the people she hires are sam robert de niro vincent jean reno and gregor stellan skarsg rd from good will hunting,negative
dierdres groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it,negative
they accomplish this task but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again,negative
the briefcase stays on the run as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed,negative
the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie but failed to understand that just because there are surprises it doesnt add too the credibility of a senseless script,negative
the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on after the apparent climax of the film,negative
but to add to the excitement as i mentioned earlier there are endless car chase scenes,negative
they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story,negative
dont get me wrong i love car chases but they were overdone and too long here,negative
we never do find out whats in the briefcase but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller,negative
it happens every year the days get longer the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their bigbudget blockbusters,negative
this years crop already seems inferior to that of past summers even 1997s lackluster trio of batman robin the fifth element and the lost world,negative
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla heeere leezerd leezerd which doesnt make me optimistic about future summers,negative
godzilla is of course based on a series of cult movies translation really bad movies only a few people can tolerate from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turnerowned cable stations,negative
that this bigbudget remake wont rise above its roots is fairly obvious,negative
the credits show us the origin of godzilla,negative
in five words nuclear explosion creates giant lizard,negative
sounds like an enquirer headline doesnt it,negative
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable discovery sequence,negative
this time a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling if that aint a stereotype,negative
when he discovers the telltale radar blip,negative
people die,negative
cut to our protagonist played by matthew broderick,negative
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones warbling along to singin in the rain,negative
its a nonetoosubtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie,negative
no dice bueller,negative
from the beginning poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzillas enormous footprint,negative
every disaster movie has to have a knowitall scientist and this time broderick is it,negative
as the worlds leading expert on radiated earthworms and wouldnt you love to have that printed on your business card,negative
broderick is invaluable to the government,negative
he immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because hey you cant take seriously the intellectual arguments of newsradio cast members,negative
broderick instead hits the nail on the head announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard,negative
the radiation isnt an anamoly he announces and lightning strikes,negative
i believe this is a mutated abberation he continues and lightning strikes again,negative
its vocabulary lightning you see activated by words of four syllables or more,negative
meanwhile were introduced to our new york cast headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist maria patillo brodericks former love,negative
gee what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time,negative
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer,negative
italian cameraman hank azaria tells her shes not ruthless enough nice doesnt get you anywhere in this town,negative
its dog eat dog,negative
actually its lizard eat city as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apples core,negative
the filmmakers provide us with a onenote drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla,negative
i think ive got a bite he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him,negative
you can guess what happens next,negative
similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city,negative
hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps one new yorker remarks please dont tell me thats another parade,negative
please dont tell me thats the best line you could come up with,negative
mayor ebert is not pleased,negative
played by the principal from head of the class he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option and bickers with his assistant gene,negative
i guess the filmmakers knew theyd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didnt even bother to kiss ass,negative
the problem is if youre going to attack siskel and ebert you should at least make it funny,negative
dialogue like didnt we agree that we werent going to have any sweets until after the election,negative
followed by back off gene just doesnt work for me,negative
other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick characters last name and frenchman jean renos inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york,negative
theres even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses,negative
as the beast heads back into hiding broderick suggests the military lure it out with food,negative
cue twelve dump trucks all dropping fish into a new york intersection,negative
broderick thats a lot of fish,negative
that ambush fails but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying 50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them,negative
yep godzillas with children which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla,negative
thats until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually like linda tripp,negative
godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day so it has a lot of dumb action scenes destructive special effects and shallow subplots,negative
look no further than patillos betrayal of broderick patillo what have i done animal,negative
what have i become and the climactic godzillas nest sequence in madison square garden,negative
the main difference is independence day was about the experience,negative
it had a real global patriotic element to it and some genuinely fun characters,negative
godzilla has lots of rain and lightning reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak blockbuster juicy fruit swatch sprint and bumble bee tuna,negative
yes bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla,negative
that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie,negative
8mm written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery,negative
nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles who is asked by upper class toff mrs christian myra carter to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe,negative
the movie happens to be an mythical snuff movie where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed,negative
all mrs christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not,negative
welles agrees and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies with video clerk max california phoenix as his guide,negative
although the snuff industry hasnt really been examined in mainstream cinema 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most,negative
the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away,negative
8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much and apart from a few moments most of the action in the film is nothing you havent seen from another standard thriller,negative
the cast help towards the entertainment apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage,negative
while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona 1987 ever since leaving las vegas 1995 cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot such as in the terrible snake eyes 1998,negative
here in 8mm hes boring uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice,negative
and in this overlong thriller these virtues do not help keep the suspense up,negative
only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving as phoenix is a true talent,negative
his performance is a great break away from the gloom and hes just purely enjoyable to watch,negative
catherine keener is completely wasted as cages wife although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves,negative
her character though is hugely underwritten one of the most wasted characters of the year,negative
also fun is fargos peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director,negative
as this film is written by the person behind seven 8mm is filled with doom and gloom and noone appears to know how to use an light switch,negative
unlike seven 8mm isnt too clever and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives,negative
lacking the strong characters seven featured 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment,negative
but director joel schumacher the completely wrong guy for the job puts style over content and while the direction and look are good its just not very disturbing,negative
schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience and though we are meant to be looking at the dark belly of the porn industry it doesnt exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind which misses the point,negative
also the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed so cliched its amazing to think its the same film youre watching,negative
8mm is far from an success a snuffed opportunity,negative
with a boring lead character controversial scenes that manage not to be controversial and a director obsessed with looks what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller,negative
ultimately 8mm is probably worth renting on home video unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like,negative
and trust me the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it,negative
steve martin shines but sgt bilko,negative
fails to impress,negative
based on the popular 50s sitcom sgt,negative
bilko follows the string of oldsitcomstomovie conversion fever,negative
remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back,negative
brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped,negative
i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy but the tvconversionmovies are hitting our screens like wildfire sad to say with mixed success,negative
such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie,negative
sgt,negative
bilko frankly i have not seen any its original tv version even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd failed to entertain,negative
sgt ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool place of vehicle storage and repair of fort baxter,negative
though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out moneymaking opportunities from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4d pools,negative
though materialistic in mind bilkos methods has thoughtfully enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that,negative
colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn blissfullyconfused state bilko has managed to hide his operation though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it,negative
bilkos state of ascent is suddenly underfire when the pentagon sends major thorn a tough cookie on army regulations to check on the progress on the 70 million hovertank project a new weapon under development within the forts grounds,negative
to add to his problems thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major sabo done on him by bilko during their younger army days,negative
director jonathan lynn who directed my cousin vinny in which marisa tomei won an oscar for bestsupporting actress managed to pull sgt,negative
bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter but that is about it,negative
there are really not enough laughterpackedmoments in sgt,negative
bilko to fully entertain the average moviegoer,negative
still steve martins sgt,negative
bilko is played with finesse and fullforce by the renowned comedian,negative
without him sgt,negative
bilko would have just fell flat on its face,negative
sgt,negative
bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world,negative
the current trend in mixed successes in such tvconversions may be a blessing in disguise really at least it will force hollywood to rethink any of its initial intentions to turn another tvidea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity,negative
unless you are a fan of the tvseries or love to watch steve martin in action you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres,negative
im sure there are better ones around,negative
ive got to admit it,negative
im a huge jim carrey fan,negative
i loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumberand even in batman forever which was a pretty awful movie carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good,negative
until i saw ace ventura 2 i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying,negative
sadly ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be,negative
carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie but this time it is no longer funnyit is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i,negative
the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof,negative
soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and if not returned in four days will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other,negative
once again its up to ace to save the day using his uncanny detective skills,negative
those who have been disappointed by carreys more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him overacting to the best of his ability but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesnt capture the feel of the original,negative
the original benefited from what looked to be carreys constant hypedup improv sequences which were hysterically funny,negative
here however the tighter script which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies takes the improvised material from the first and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie giving carrey little chance to improvise,negative
instead his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly,negative
but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself,negative
in the first movie he was always cool and one step ahead of every one elseperfect for carreys offthewall approach,negative
but here ventura is made to look a lot stupider and is often made out as the straight guya role which is definitely not carreys style,negative
there are definitely some very funny moments but they are few and far between,negative
they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura or even dumb and dumber,negative
vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly dangelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family,negative
as with the other three films their two children rusty and audrey are played by a revolving series of actors,negative
this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles,negative
also back is cousin eddie randy quaid the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes,negative
in vegas vacation clark griswold chase decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen dangelo can renew their wedding vows,negative
it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue,negative
apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldnt bother to write any jokes into the script,negative
at least thats the way it looks when watching this turkey,negative
about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film since there had been none up to that point,negative
by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times and i had smiled at a couple of gags,negative
i might add that none of the funny and i use the term loosely moments came as a result of anything chase dangelo or quaid were involved in,negative
they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film,negative
the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids who manage to have a couple of their own adventures,negative
rusty becomes a vegas high roller providing most of the films best moments,negative
every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film,negative
which brings me to the best moment of the film,negative
the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road the theme from the original vacation begins to play,negative
christie brinkley and her red ferrari also from the first movie drive by,negative
it was a cute moment but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been and just how far that this series has fallen,negative
too bad,negative
words i thought id never write the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace wit and power of the original,negative
put the gun to my head pull the trigger and put me out of my misery,negative
better yet put the horror genre out of its misery,negative
when youve finished watching urban legends final cut youll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting terrible script and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today,negative
urban legends final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas mainly from the blair witch project and scream fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin one creepy film school and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movies hapless victims,negative
urban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted hitchcock award which guarantees the winner a director deal in hollywood,negative
one female filmmaker jennifer morrison the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to urban legend tales,negative
suddenly her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urbanlegendary homicides but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings,negative
the killer wears a fencing mask and a long black overcoat looking like a scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney,negative
why this is scary is never explained,negative
of course the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuitys sake,negative
urban legends has one minor recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway the security guard of all people,negative
the other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before but shes utterly clueless about whats going on around her,negative
call it suspension of disbelief,negative
this film is also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water,negative
the last decent horror film was the blair witch project and that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction,negative
the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich as everyone seems to have forgotten real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown,negative
to watch battlefield earth is to wallow in misery,negative
it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history,negative
it has a clumsily told story insipid dialogue shallow characterizations ugly scene transitions no evidence of dramatic arc headacheinducing sound effects and a resolution that is completely implausible,negative
worse theres the promise of a sequel,negative
why,negative
save your money,negative
some films go quickly to video,negative
this one however should go straight to the scifi channels mystery science theatre,negative
in the year 3000 man has become an endangered species,negative
most of humanity called mananimals was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens called psychlos,negative
survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earths resources for the rest of their lives,negative
the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand ninefeet tall who resemble inbred klingons,negative
dimwitted as they are tall their culture is predicated on power extortion and getting leverage,negative
travolta the leverageusing star plays terl the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth,negative
much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terls petty machinations,negative
he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter,negative
but one thing is certain he hates being stationed on earth,negative
when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet he begins to devise his latest plan,negative
he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site,negative
its not clear how this benefits terl except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it,negative
the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler barry peppers is selected as the slave groups leader,negative
a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining knowhow,negative
but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language the principles of our founding fathers euclidean geometry and the location of fort knox,negative
this enlightenment just doesnt prepare him for the mining assignment,negative
it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors,negative
were going to blow up their home world he says,negative
but first we need a few more supplies,negative
in days he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling loincloth wearing rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts,negative
by now the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl,negative
the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travoltas labor of love is a piece of scifi drivel,negative
numerous journals have called it an illconceived idea stemming from blind hubris arrogance and poor planning,negative
and after watching this movie youll wholeheartedly agree,negative
this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed tediously acted and frequently begs the question why was this ever made,negative
at a price tag of 90 million this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly assuredly becoming the avengers of this summer,negative
both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity,negative
in addition to the universally pejorative reviews theres another bizarre element to the battlefield saga,negative
this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta who for over a decade had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen,negative
the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist and battlefield is based on a 1982 novel by l ron hubbard the religions late founder,negative
this led some to believe that battlefield earth would amount to scientologist dogma laden with subliminal messages,negative
but the story is so poorly told that any message subliminal or otherwise is totally undetectable,negative
if the audience got anything out of this film it was this we are not too unlike the psychlo leader,negative
like terl the audience felt imprisoned dreaded their situation and looked for any opportunity to leave,negative
could that be the scientology message,negative
in the interest of being generous i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black,negative
sir anthony hopkins playing a superrich media mogul has gathered his family around him for dinner,negative
his oldest daughter played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake,negative
the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes,negative
hopkins frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair does what any man in his position would do he punts,negative
whichever one you like dear he says,negative
and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do she cries,negative
i liked that scene for two reasons,negative
first the cakes looked really cool,negative
second it was perhaps the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act,negative
meet joe black is chockfull of odd performances people doing things for no discernible reason at all and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot,negative
its easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani but its even easier to sleep right through it two people on my row managed it quite nicely,negative
the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess,negative
i know my audience had problems with the movie because they thought it was a comedy,negative
case in point everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie,negative
however the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani,negative
its not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death but it makes a certain kind of sense,negative
it shouldnt take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr pitt,negative
and indeed they do after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished,negative
well when that happened the audience howled with laughter and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous,negative
so if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawingroom humor are funny i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately,negative
anyway the deceased lawyers body no worse the wear from its massive injuries is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role,negative
the idea is that death given the pen name of joe black so as not to disturb others wants to take a holiday and experience the world,negative
if this werent hollywood we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death but since it is we get scene after scene of fishoutofwater humor just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck whos wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesnt know how to act in our society,negative
it also doesnt help that the character of death is written so inconsistently,negative
he claims to be on vacation but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try to get your travel agent to book that one,negative
he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois,negative
he knows everything about some characters nothing about others,negative
and as played by brad pitt hes not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing hes just there,negative
its as if someone told pitt never mind about acting in this picture son just stand there and look pretty,negative
its as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie,negative
ive used the phrase angel of death in this review very deliberately to contrast pitts performance with this years best angel performance nicolas cages in city of angels,negative
where pitt is cold and unfeeling cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows,negative
where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man pitt is aloof and arrogant,negative
cage struck instant chemical sparks with costar meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlanis character is so shallow that she cant see beyond pitts good looks,negative
the movies other top name is a much better actor but that doesnt save meet joe black,negative
sir anthony hopkins isnt given much better material to work with unfortunately,negative
he plays one of these goodhearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood,negative
one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkinss character more realistically evil,negative
hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world,negative
of course no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder,negative
but i have to wonder and in this movie you have a very long time to wonder how you or i would act in a similar situation especially if you or i were a multimillionaire,negative
hopkins pretty much goes to the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation,negative
fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated im sure,negative
i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black and im asking myself why,negative
movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest which is what im going to do now,negative
go spend time with your family go volunteer for a local charity heck go take a nap,negative
dont go see meet joe black because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death,negative
curtis edmonds,negative
no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it,negative
sideshow bob,negative
i am continually amazed at movies like this,negative
that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mindboggeling but it seems to happen a lot nowadays,negative
wild wild west is a beautifully filmed well acted and well directed piece of garbage and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault,negative
in short this movie is a comedy without laughs,negative
so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal,negative
the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco but its still pretty boring,negative
will smith stars as jim west an old western rb variation of the james bond character,negative
west is teamed up with artemus gordon kevin kline and theyre pretty much polar oppisites west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach,negative
talk about deeply developed characters,negative
at any rate this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies none of which are funny,negative
the year is 1869,negative
several top scientists have been abducted and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general bloodbath mcgrath ted levine,negative
president grant sends west and gordon to investigate,negative
theres evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana,negative
west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh another disgruntled former confederate,negative
as it turns out loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon which he will use to conquer the united states,negative
id go further with the plot but there isnt any point,negative
this films narrative is little more than a jumbled unfunny mess,negative
i only laughed at a couple of jokes and then only lightly,negative
there isnt one truly uprorously funny moment in this film and thats pretty disasterous when you consider that its primarily a comedy,negative
as i said the fault is totally that of the script,negative
when you consider their respective roles will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done,negative
the leads couldve been played samuel l jackson and robert de niro and the film still wouldve been awful,negative
no one and i mean no one can make a line like bye bye mr knife guy,negative
sound good,negative
still this film has a lot going for it visually,negative
the set design is fantastic maybe even oscar worthy,negative
the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus who was also behind camera in martin scorseses brilliant goodfellas is absolutely stunning,negative
he lends the film a much needed exciting comic bookish look,negative
i wont fault barry sonnenfeld either,negative
he does a fine job of directing the proceedings but like the rest of the people involved with the film there really isnt anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw,negative
despite being beautifully made wild wild west becomes quite boring after the halfway point,negative
the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does,negative
if wild wild west didnt look so good it would be almost insufferable,negative
as it is its somewhat tolerable but not very entertaining,negative
it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low but there isnt anything much worse than an unfunny comedy,negative
well lets see im,negative
not quite sure how to review this film based on its laughter factor,negative
well yeah i can its not funny,negative
ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 12 star but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever,negative
in fact this could be the unfunniest movie ive seen in a long time if not the unfunniest,negative
let me be the first to say ready to rumble is a huge disappointment,negative
long time wrestling lovers david and scott dream of making it to the wcw and watching jimmy king wrestle,negative
that is their hero of course whom is kicked out of the wcw,negative
well here is where the plot thickens lol the two wish to rescue the king and put him back into the wcw but not that easily because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them while davids father wants him to become a police officer and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots,negative
what a plot eh,negative
ready to rumble is one of those films that tries to be funny but sadly fails miserably everything in the film is imcomprehinsable and even the trailer wasnt funny,negative
the actors are dull the script awful and the plot which there isnt much of really,negative
annoying,negative
im not quite sure how great actors like these and very funny actors too are given such a lame script and directed in such a childish manner that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days,negative
this review isnt going to be very long because of the fact that there isnt much going for the film if anything at all,negative
only one big laugh is in the film which isnt all that hilarious,negative
i sat in my chair wondering with this 107,negative
minute comedy was going to be over and sadly it went on forever,negative
im not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste but believe me you it is,negative

cradle will rock is the latest effort from tim robbins,negative
while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 dead man walking he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here,negative
the story is confusing and filled with many subplots so ill try my best and explain it as simply as possible,negative
the film is based on a mostly true story about a federal theater in the 1930s that produced a play the cradle will rock that apparently was offensive to some so the government shuts it down,negative
its during the time of the depression and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs or are poor,negative
between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots about those who work in theater or those associated,negative
also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience,negative
tim robbins just keeps piling on political views and characters that we just give up on the film or in some cases walk out,negative
for robbins it may be a nice achievement but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue and fancy outfits,negative
i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast unfortunately are all uninteresting except for a few,negative
let me recap what each important character does so please bear with me its the least you can do especially if you were considering seeing this,negative
ill begin with those involved with the play,negative
theres orson welles angus macfadyen who of course is the director of the play the producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria the writer of the play emily watson a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock,negative
outside the play theres the ventriloquist bill murray who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ruben blades whos unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage john cusack,negative
theres a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories susan sarandon philip baker hall too name a few but those that i mentioned were the most significant to the story,negative
anyway most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted except for emily watson who does another great job and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack who always delivers through thick and thin,negative
now although most of the film was weak to say the least there were some nice moments and some involving subjects but all this is overblown,negative
sure the free speech segment was a nice feature but not when it becomes repetitive,negative
the whole film is like this and its basically nothing but a headache,negative
on the brighter side tim robbins direction was masterful,negative
his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas andersons latest magnolia only smoother in my opinion but even that cant make a movie that much better,negative
although it has its moments not many of them but theyre there cradle will rock stays true to its title because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over,negative
deuce bigalow rob schneider cleans fish tanks,negative
yeah i didnt know that was a real job either,negative
one of his customers is antoine leconte oded fehr a successful gigolo,negative
when antoine has to go to sweden for three weeks he lets deuce use his house to look after an ailing 800 fish,negative
fooling around deuce sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a 6000 fish tank,negative
after taking a try at one of antoines clients and earning 10 deuce decides to prostitute himself to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fierytempered antoine returns,negative
enter t j eddie griffin a pimp for manwhores who arranges for deuce to service an assortment of women whose imperfections keep them from dating,negative
theres an enormous woman played by transvestite porn star chi chi la rue who hides food in her clothes,negative
theres claire gail ogrady whose narcolepsy causes her to fall asleep every few minutes,negative
tina torsten voges is so tall her face doesnt fit on the screen and ruth amy poehler has tourettes syndrome and shouts obscenities without warning,negative
finally theres kate arija bareikis whose sorority sisters secretly paid her fare,negative
she seems perfect and deuce quickly falls in love with her,negative
she does we discover later have an imperfection but deuce decides it isnt important,negative
deuces life is complicated by a bothersome cop william forsythe looking for information on antoine and by kates discovery of his manwhoring,negative
however neither threat generates much suspense,negative
the formula is so familiar that we know how it will end from the start,negative
deuce bigalow is the first project from adam sandlers company happy madison the formation of which assures that well be seeing the sandler style of comedy massproduced at an increasing rate in years to come,negative
be afraid,negative
be very afraid,negative
the good news is that sandler doesnt actually appear in deuce and that rob schneider and eddie griffin are funnier than sandler,negative
schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but goodhearted deuce believable,negative
griffins delivery is deadon especially in the coining of technical terms for t j s profession as in dont make me hebitch manslap you,negative
theres the expected amount of toilet humor in deuce,negative
for one thing deuces dad is a mens room attendant,negative
does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny,negative
for most of us i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the farside of puberty and discover how funny sex is,negative
i for one will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed,negative
bottom line deuce doesnt offer anything new but it is intermittently funny,negative
for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones it is surprising to find the messenger the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess,negative
in the early to mid 1400s there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman,negative
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place,negative
france was involved in the hundred years war against england,negative
there was no strong political leadership in the country,negative
morale was low there being little hope for the future,negative
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing voices and seeing visions,negative
convinced that these were messages from god she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him,negative
the message if he would give her an army to command she would deliver to him the crown,negative
he does,negative
and she does,negative
then once seated on the throne he abandons her to her english captors,negative
director luc besson the fifth element may have cowrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material,negative
the inconsistencies of the cast the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes the inappropriate musical score and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable,negative
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife milla jovovich the fifth element in the title role,negative
ms jovovich looks spectacular as joan clad in battle armor astride a similarly protected horse,negative
if looks were enough to fully convey a character she would have been brilliant,negative
since it isnt she tried and failed to act the part,negative
her joan is unbalanced inspiring the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed,negative
john malkovich being john malkovich fares a bit better as the dauphin who joan would see on the throne as charles vii,negative
an easily manipulated man his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death,negative
faye dunaway the thomas crown affair gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphins motherinlaw and chief advisor,negative
the army under joans command are comprised of comical figures more stooges than soldiers,negative
the one exception would be tcheky karyo la femme nikita as dunois the man who was leading the attack prior to joans arrival,negative
trying to plan a systematic campaign he sees his leadership authority negated by joans insistence on following her visions,negative
dustin hoffman sphere has a small inhuman role as joans conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial,negative
dressed like cloaked monk he leads her to doubt herself and her revelations,negative
as well she should,negative
scriptures do speak of revelation,negative
god via his gift of holy spirit is able to communicate to men,negative
three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation,negative
they are word of knowledge word of wisdom and discerning of spirits,negative
even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his holy men,negative
who spake as they were moved by holy spirit i e,negative
by revelation,negative
but the scriptures also caution us,negative
beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world,negative
1 john 4 1 kjv,negative
joans end being burned at the stake at the age of 19 the frenzy mob rule and blood lust her inspiration wrought and the death pain or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one,negative
while her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality she was as others have been before and since misled by the spiritual master of deception,negative
as a messenger she was quite effective,negative
she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying,negative
at times youd think edtv would be an entertaining film,negative
i mean who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day,negative
but this average joe ed perkuny matthew mcconaughay is a sappy lifeless creation that wanders around trying to solve everyones problems and settle his own,negative
mcconaughay is awful especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans,negative
frankly he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys,negative
he overacts in every way his overexaggerant body language obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life and drops to his knee and cries,negative
the rest of the cast is very good especially martin landau as eds stepfather who plays a cute role as the closetodeath old guy that makes all the witty comments,negative
jenna elfman is good but a little overemotional her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films i e,negative
cant hardly wait and krippendorfs tribe,negative
woody harrelson as eds brother ray does his usual eggheaded role with his comic wit as well he wrote a book entitled my brother pissed on me,negative
elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut and dennis hopper in a quick cameo as eds biological father is a nice choice ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show,negative
ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who after awhile decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec rob reiners opinion,negative
i hate to compare this film to the truman show but the fact is i was ashamed to see this movie,negative
it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed,negative
edtv had no real wit or genius it was typical hollywood,negative
extracting the tv part of the movie you have the simple plotline man steals brothers girlfriend girlfriend leaves town man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on slut breaks up with him real girlfriend comes back and voila you have a romance,negative
i got so restless during this movie i almost walked out,negative
the only reason it doesnt drop below a c grade is because of the fine supporting performances,negative
ad2am i almost lost my nose and,negative
i like it,negative
i like breathing through it,negative
jack nicholson chinatown,negative
in life eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison,negative
after about an hour of watching this movie you begin to realize how their characters feel,negative
fortunately for audience members theres a chance to escape the nearest exit,negative
this undoubtedly is eddie murphys worst movie and thats an accomplishment,negative
remember the golden child harlem nights,negative
compared to life they look like citizen kane,negative
life is long predictable foulmouthed and only intermittently funny,negative
its 100minute running time feels like 100 years,negative
robert ramsey and matthew stones script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as motherf s or n,negative
s,negative
you lose count how many times both those obnoxious offensive words are used,negative
and if that all it takes to write a script than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie,negative
but like life it will probably stink,negative
to be honest the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up,negative
but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well,negative
life is as sophisticated as a belch,negative
its crude and stereotypical,negative
years ago movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient secondclass people good for being only maids and servants,negative
for the most part the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved,negative
but a new more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies,negative
in many recent films through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers blacks are presented as fasttalking conniving scam artists or hiphop guncrazy sexcrazed youths,negative
both sets of caricatures are demeaning,negative
and the fault does not rest with the actors,negative
they have to eat too,negative
it is with the people who write the scripts the studios who greenlight the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest,negative
lifes only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds,negative
otherwise life is an embarrassment a blot on the resumes of those associated with it,negative
see it at your own risk,negative
synopsis a man whose lover paris was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system,negative
the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend laura and becomes addicted to virtual reality which due to a design flaw in his unit recreates the dead paris,negative
comments virtual seduction executive produced by roger corman and lance h robbins serves as a cheaplymade precursor to strange days a far superior film,negative
both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ab using technology to be with former lovers in strange days the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality,negative
interestingly both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium though strange days uses the setting far more effectively,negative
this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction,negative
its not bad for what it is lowbudget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality,negative
unfortunately its been done before and since in much better films a fact which ultimately leaves the scifi fan bored by this movie,negative
virtual seduction has many faults one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins,negative
the films script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavyhanded and wooden as the movie progresses,negative
many important scenes seem too dark the lighting could have been improved significantly,negative
the cast a collection of veteran bmovie actors and sitcom regulars do only a mediocre job in their roles,negative
jeff fahey of the original lawnmower man convincingly though unenergetically plays the lead character,negative
carrie genzel plays paris the vr lover but ami dolenz as the current love interest seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality which doesnt lend credence to the films premise,negative
meschach taylor of the once popular designing women sitcom adequately plays a scientist working on the project but his performance isnt something to write home about either,negative
virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background,negative
in other words one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then but its rather boring to just sit and watch,negative
the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from bmovies in this genre but it is still an adult rrated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt,negative
this turkey ultimately isnt awful but its not particularly interesting or unique either,negative
dont be seduced into watching this movie unless youve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch,negative
and now the highflying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics and it isnt pretty,negative
this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer a version of dumass the three musketeers,negative
by bringing in popular asian coordinator xing xing xiong whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting,negative
the end result is a tepid and dull ripoff that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu,negative
the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay,negative
dartagnan justin chambers is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer,negative
he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents,negative
in paris he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu stephen rea who is trying to overthrow the king and richelieus maninblack associate febre tim roth the killer of his folks,negative
he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk so he rounds up aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steven spiers to free the musketeers wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the kings prison,negative
dartagnan and his new frisky love francesca mena suvari play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen catherine deneuve ends up being captured by the menancing febre forcing the musketeers to regroup with dartagnan leading the charge and save the day,negative
director peter hyams end of days obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles but here its a disaster,negative
one problem is that in reality most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones,negative
jet lis high risk is a ripoff of die hard not the other way around,negative
ironically there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes,negative
most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20 to 30minute action sequences because they know the scenes have to carry the picture,negative
the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano sudden death horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers the wedding planner to deliver his mousy self as a leader,negative
chambers dartangnan isnt a musketeer hes a mouseketeer,negative
and hyams use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are wellnoted but thats the only standout in an overall flat production,negative
teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood,negative
every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand,negative
the formula is very simple you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal,negative
you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes the typical teenage attention span,negative
the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they don92t care to judge films92 quality so any piece of trash will due,negative
that is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash,negative
josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times,negative
she has her own personal assistant unlimited supplies and her own office,negative
but she is very much dismayed with her position in life,negative
there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field where she can play a more active role in the chicago media,negative
so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jumps at it with elation,negative
constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gus john c reilly,negative
the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter,negative
however since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes and josie is headed for the field,negative
obviously the field assignment involves a high school,negative
specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them,negative
i don92t think that i need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring so i won92t,negative
the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school,negative
interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was and she appears to be heading down that road again,negative
fortunately for this lame production other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting,negative
they include the predictable love stories between both a student jeremy jordan and a teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body,negative
also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative,negative
the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing,negative
typical for teenage films it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor,negative
one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical,negative
most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy,negative
but those still don92t recover for the total lack of quality in this movie,negative
following this trend of high school movie rules comes the general acting,negative
it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film,negative
in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch,negative
she is required to play her character on two levels having some very black and white transitions,negative
and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time,negative
at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher,negative
but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance,negative
following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live,negative
she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic,negative
it is these qualities that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent,negative
luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film,negative
david arquette scream takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined,negative
and as a central character he gets to take on his own miniplot which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed,negative
in a dazzling cherryonthesundae type piece of work he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit risky business,negative
never been kissed is a mediocre film at best,negative
the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception,negative
the acting is just as bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light,negative
unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be a success because teenagers will pay to see any trash,negative
over 40 years ago a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankinds nuclear testing,negative
partly flight of fancy partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo,negative
a year later gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things a new name a dubbed english track and raymond burr,negative
as godzilla the film took on the rest of the world,negative
thirty years later toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things yes including raymond burr and called it godzilla 1985,negative
now its 14 years after tohos remake and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run,negative
in emmerichs godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiationinduced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms,negative
when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states,negative
meanwhile tatopouloss college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works in new york city as an assistant to a bigtime news reporter,negative
shed like to be a reporter herself and when godzilla comes ashore she figures this is her big break,negative
of course with the big guy running amok in the city niko and audrey are bound to cross paths and are joined by victor animal palotti hank azaria audreys trusty cameraman friend and phillipe roche jean reno an operative for the french government whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place,negative
together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla,negative
with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nations premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla,negative
he didnt,negative
right up there with the lost world godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history,negative
the plot is pretty much what we expect the big dinosaurlike creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city and its up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down,negative
the script however is painfully bad,negative
its fraught with lines so corny they dont even belong in bmovies and includes many character actions which make you think you idiot or you stupid girl,negative
i suppose when youve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well,negative
why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them but is conveniently able to leap atop others,negative
why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line,negative
why do sidewinder missiles which have small explosive warheads blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla,negative
why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f18 fighterbombers when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two,negative
okay maybe the last one was a bit nitpicky but hey i was on a roll,negative
broderick is usually a good actor but in this film hes weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way,negative
hank azaria does what he can but dont expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage,negative
like brodericks azarias character is quite simply lacking in color,negative
what really annoyed me was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting,negative
casting must have been asleep on this one,negative
the one bright spot here is jean reno who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic quite unlike what weve seem him do in the past,negative
although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable,negative
unfortunately the same cannot be said of the other incongruities,negative
the entire feel of the movie is tongueincheek and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it,negative
this results in a significant amount of parody which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster and ends up just producing a mess,negative
most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously,negative
although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens,negative
if we cant take the characters seriously the threat they face is an empty one because we simply dont care what happens to them,negative
godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more lighthearted than it should be,negative
far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters but heres a behemoth running through the city,negative
theres bound to be a lot of casualties but instead godzilla is afflicted with the afterschool g i,negative
joe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems to get out of harms way just in time,negative
in a couple of scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire,negative
none of the characters even remark upon this ability nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers,negative
its as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes godzilla can do this just like in the old movie,negative
consider another punch pulled,negative
through creative script writing you can make a sequel out of just about any movie but the final scene in this one doesnt just leave the door open it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently,negative
it made me want to gag,negative
emmerich should have done away with 90 of the humor and injokes and played this one as a straight action film,negative
with an intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been so much more,negative
however by confusing the viewer with a ton of addins and parodies the movie ends up being something that just doesnt work,negative
now if they only had raymond burr,negative
i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws,negative
but if you ask me the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american,negative
or more the point anyone that allows him to bask in his own lessthansubtle presence,negative
this is not an insult to gere as i consider him to be a rather talented actor but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role,negative
if a film is solely about one person the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work,negative
although geres performance is in no way poorly acted it is far from perfect and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself,negative
this is where he truly belongs and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear with the sensational edward norton the jackal with bruce willis and pretty woman with the delightful julia roberts,negative
in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear bold and up front who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind,negative
it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail,negative
it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room drunk and cheerful,negative
yet instead of a hangover poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch,negative
he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison,negative
his cell food and rights all terrible,negative
now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy lawyer shen yuelin bai ling defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder,negative
jack and shen argue about their countries different laws shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family,negative
as the plot thickens scenes get progressively more ridiculous ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected butyouknewalong criminal is discovered,negative
red corner is one of those films where you sneer laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes,negative
what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act,negative
this is not to say that the film does not have its moments there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption,negative
but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch,negative
if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly the basic idea is quite tangible,negative
it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate the evidence that goes missing the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before,negative
if that wasnt bad enough red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions,negative
shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself,negative
taking itself far too seriously red corner is not half the film it intends to be,negative
although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast the films main fault is in the bizarre and often out of place way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway,negative
whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again,negative
martin vailwhere are you,negative
one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jeanluc godard film,negative
after all he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave,negative
he is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing,negative
however his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year,negative
the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels and reconciliation,negative
these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples young adult and elderly,negative
it is edgars bruno putzulu selfappointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup to define a central idea its only when things are over that they make sense,negative
whether this project will end up a play film or opera remains undecided,negative
the thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone,negative
instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes the next scene no more engaging than the last,negative
only once does any character utter something worthwhile but by the time it happens youre so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it,negative
but dont fret it will surface again,negative
you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film as some fellow critics did and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile,negative
but you hold hope for some time,negative
the background music keeps you in a state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversations,negative
its only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope,negative
and with speeches like i am thinking of something but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else how can you expect to hold anyones interest,negative
to godards credit he certainly knows how to frame a scene,negative
the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful,negative
watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him,negative
and if this film had anything poignant to say you would have which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities,negative
the environments be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complements them,negative
unfortunately godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene,negative
sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words,negative
the second half is composed of nauseating hypercolor that often blurs the image,negative
you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners,negative
the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies,negative
steven spielberg is picked on in particular,negative
while ill grant that this does happen and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage its still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood,negative
it just goes to show an intelligent person isnt necessarily an admirable storyteller,negative
the days of breathless are no more,negative
love to kill starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes,negative
at the outset the movie appears to be about tony danza whos an illegal distributor of guns trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman,negative
danza sets up a double date with her her sister and a collegue of his,negative
everything seems to be going well until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs,negative
much confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up and other associates of danzas begin to emerge all after one thing or another,negative
sound confusing,negative
it is,negative
i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity,negative
in some respects it works,negative
but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess,negative
characters keep popping up with no explanation demanding money for deals that occur offscreen,negative
the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister,negative
but so little time is devoted to this part of the story we never really become too familiar with these characters and because of this we dont really care what happens to them,negative
well i didnt at least,negative
one thing i will give the movie is that its a complete departure for tony danza,negative
heres a guy because of his many sitcom roles whos ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing,negative
here he plays a man whos just looking out for himself and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin so be it,negative
i was very impressed by his performance and within minutes of the start of the film i had forgotten all about his goodguy persona,negative
michael madsen is also good as an associate of danzas who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him,negative
like i said its not exactly a linear storyline,negative
love to kill should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre but its just too bad that the story doesnt really add up to much,negative
the stars deserved better and so did the audience,negative
as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times,negative
but alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber,negative
its amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything,negative
the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful,negative
this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor,negative
well this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded,negative
along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber,negative
thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience,negative
the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber but it seems to have a life of its own,negative
this is there strictly for the kids,negative
the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs,negative
although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone,negative
the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at get his fiancee back finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire and do all this in the funniest way possible,negative
admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original the absent minded professor,negative
the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable,negative
the basketball players stereotypically unqualified for the sport somehow manage to bounce fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning,negative
this just sounds too bad to be true the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance,negative
as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie,negative
giving life to the flubber which is so poorly executed that its best forgotten and prof brainards flying robot weebo,negative
giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasnt for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie,negative
the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well but it wasnt and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good,negative
now weebo is a totally different story,negative
its a robot that prof brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too,negative
this is a really original idea well maybe not but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie,negative
yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters,negative
the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all,negative
the acting by robin williams prof,negative
brainard seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced,negative
most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12,negative
people when stood up at the altar dont usually give third chances,negative
or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards but what can be expected this is a childrens movie,negative
flubber as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect,negative
with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great,negative
it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end but it does not wash up to the original,negative
kids should find this movie amusing and fun and theyll probably enjoy the whole movie,negative
as a movie its just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that,negative
two party guys bob their heads to haddaways dance hit what is love,negative
while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub,negative
its barely enough to sustain a threeminute saturdaynightlive skit but snl producer lorne michaels clueless creator amy heckerling and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institutions recurring roxbury guys sketch that would presumably make a good feature,negative
emphasis on the word presumably,negative
anightattheroxbury takes an alreadythin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking pointand that of viewers patience levels,negative
the first five minutes or so of roxbury play very much like one of the original roxbury guys skits,negative
with what is love,negative
blaring on the soundtrack the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi chris kattan and will ferrell bob their heads scope out hotties at clubs and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts,negative
there is one crucial difference howeverthese guys speak,negative
that little fact has been used as justification for the films existence that the butabis newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters,negative
the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren ferrell and kattan are new thats for sure but they all lead to comic dead ends,negative
there is no story per se only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots,negative
the brothers literally run into or rather get run into as in by car richard grieco of 21jumpstreet fame and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club,negative
there they meet a hotshot club owner chazz palminteri conspicuously uncreditedcan you blame him who takes an interest in an idea of theirs,negative
meanwhile the bros overbearing father dan hedaya wants them to stop clubbing,negative
when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father a rift is created between the two,negative
the narrative messiness of roxbury would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny but virtually none of it is,negative
the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end,negative
alas the jokea rather lazy takeoff on jerrymaguirewill only strike a chord with people who have seen that film,negative
granted a lot of people have seen jerrymaguire but the fact that the films best joke is completely dependent on ones familiarity with another film says a lot about roxburys lack of inspiration,negative
that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves,negative
like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of saturdaynightlive the roxbury guys is a onejoke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context,negative
after watching one of the roxbury skits on snl this is what you come away with from the characters they bob their heads to what is love,negative
bump unsuspecting women and thats all,negative
after watching anightattheroxbury youll be left with exactly the same,negative
a friend invites you to a movie,negative
this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare and be grounded in reality,negative
the plot is as follows after a terrifying incident a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city,negative
they need fresh air to get some perspective maybe to start over,negative
romance begins to brew however as one of the locals played by an international superstar in rugged clothing sparks things up especially at a countrywestern slow dance,negative
it stars a rising young starlet helms a good cast and is directed by one of the better actorturneddirectors in hollywood,negative
you accept,negative
you jump at the opportunity to see what you believe to be the horse whisperer,negative
but poor moviegoer you have been conned,negative
alas you find yourself watching incredulously hope floats,negative
oh woe,negative
your hope has sunk,negative
why was this movie made,negative
why was it released,negative
it is a travesty on nearly every level and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved,negative
at the hands of a better script the film could have been a gem,negative
but it is clueless as to what it is about and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers,negative
hope floats stars sandra bullock as birdy who after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend on national television no less takes her daughter and drives back to her home helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands she decorates with stuffed wildlife,negative
birdys nephew travis played by leave it to beavers cameron finley is under her custody and in one of the films many failed injokes is always seen wearing a different halloween costume,negative
what is the point of this,negative
does it make any sense,negative
is it supposed to be funny,negative
the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child,negative
all of this undercuts the plot of which there is none,negative
there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion,negative
theres the scene where birdy who used to be the prom queen is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked for a job,negative
theres the scene where birdy dances with her father in the hospital for alzheimers,negative
and then theres the sentimental scenes with justin played by harry connick jr who is taking a liking to her again showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch,negative
and during each of these scenes i was sidetracked by my earlier question,negative
what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume a kermit costume a cowboy costume with whip and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner,negative
what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life,negative
outside of this there are other sure signs of screenwriters block,negative
when the daughter stands up to the bully at school,negative
when birdy almost loses her job,negative
when the family pulls in a goofy lipsynch to cheer someone up,negative
when someone dies,negative
when the daughter cries no wails in exasperation that her father is not coming back,negative
in a movie like this you notice the strings being pushed and you sit there comatose hoping it will end,negative
who can survive such a debacle,negative
i worry for bullocks career which has been running on autopilot for the last few years,negative
she has an attitude a solid perkiness and can drive a busbut she cant handle the emotional scenes much less hold a southern accent,negative
harry connick jr is worsestick with singing or get some acting lessons please,negative
gena rowlands is the best part of the film,negative
but shes such a good actress that it staggers the mind that shes weighed down by such lukewarm material here,negative
it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes great films is known for this film,negative
two notes to forest whittaker 1 cut the slowmotion sequences,negative
there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick,negative
have you done so you could have shaved off tenminutes of this almost unbearable debacle,negative
2 youve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographers filter makes the candlelight appear like little x s,negative
youre not a bad director but you cant change a terrible script,negative
theres a recurring scene where birdy working at the neighborhood fotomat finds the machine go wrong and image after destroyed warped dark image appear,negative
think about it,negative
a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie,negative
okay i just dont know why but i seem to be getting this diversion to disneymade reallife actors movies as,negative
well as reallife acting tim allen movies,negative
i couldnt even make it through the santa clause so why did i even see this,negative
just to make an idle point i did like toy story but that was good also i have this aversion to bad french farces and if they remake them into american films,negative
well this is my excuse it was prom night im not a prom person my best friend and i impulsively went to the driveins where they were playing grosse pointe blank wouldnt mind seeing it again but i had to suffer through this first,negative
i agreed to go,negative
ugh,negative
in all fairness i can say that at least this inane plot wasnt dreamed by an american,negative
it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of little indian big city french title un indien dans la ville,negative
i stayed away from it like it was limburgher and according to roger ebert that was a good idea,negative
but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement,negative
the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage,negative
let me clarify his wife jobeth williams left him years ago and i mean years around 13 or so and went to an island in the carribean or something,negative
he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this thing,negative
played with an emphasis on overdone by lolita davidovitch who is usually good,negative
she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off,negative
he meets him he has a weird name mimi seku i think or,negative
as the bad joke goes mitsubishi laugh track cue he knows english they fish more bad jokes pirhanna joke the kid has a pet spider he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty you,negative
know the drill,negative
now this is where the plot complicates well complicates for this one at least the fishoutofwater joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city,negative
tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasnt able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is martin short,negative
a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere how come in every hokey french import there is a mob,negative
tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries,negative
the story is crap the jokes are hokey and not really funny and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting,negative
but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldnt help it,negative
the whole time i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this,negative
at the end of filming did they all scream out weve made a great movie guys,negative
i sure hope not,negative
big question to get from this film why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if theyre just going to do it the exact same way,negative
huh,negative
my for some of the actors names and a joke or two that made me chuckle i guess okay,negative
so i really feel bad for it so i only gave it one star,negative
quest for camelot is warner bros first featurelength fullyanimated attempt to steal clout from disneys cartoon empire but the mouse has no reason to be worried,negative
the only other recent challenger to their throne was last falls promising if flawed 20th century fox production anastasia but disneys hercules with its lively cast and colorful palate had her beat handsdown when it came time to crown 1997s best piece of animation,negative
this year its no contest as quest for camelot is pretty much dead on arrival,negative
even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre thatd be pocahontas for those of you keeping score isnt nearly as dull as this,negative
the story revolves around the adventures of freespirited kayley voiced by jessalyn gilsig the earlyteen daughter of a belated knight from king arthurs round table,negative
kayleys only dream is to follow in her fathers footsteps and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber gary oldman an exround table membergonebad steals arthurs magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous boobytrapped forest,negative
with the help of hunky blind timberlanddweller garrett carey elwes and a twoheaded dragon eric idle and don rickles thats always arguing with itself kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthurs side,negative
quest for camelot is missing pure showmanship an essential element if its ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney,negative
theres nothing here that differentiates quest from something youd see on any given saturday morning cartoon subpar animation instantly forgettable songs poorlyintegrated computerized footage,negative
compare kayley and garretts runin with the angry ogre to hercs battle with the hydra,negative
i rest my case,negative
even the characters stink none of them are remotely interesting so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can outbland the others,negative
in the end its a tie they all win,negative
that dragons comedy shtick is awfully cloying but at least it shows signs of a pulse,negative
at least fans of the early90s tgif television lineup will be thrilled to find jaleel urkel white and bronson balki pinchot sharing the same footage,negative
a few scenes are nicely realized though im at a loss to recall enough to be specific and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic though most are paired up with singers who dont sound a thing like them for their big musical moments jane seymour and celine dion,negative
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good,negative
aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults quest for camelot s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality,negative
and personality we learn from this mess goes a very long way,negative
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,negative
be forewarned,negative
at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere,negative
this highlyanticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone headtohead against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to a less potent midaugust opening was an obvious early indication of the studios lack of confidence with the picture,negative
and with good reason,negative
this is a joyless exercise of a film held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit,negative
remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last years case study in style over substance joel schumachers muchloathed batman robin,negative
indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes,negative
uma thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuitclad karatechopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage,negative
unfortunately the same cant be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade doubleentendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that theyre on board a sinking ship,negative
at this rate usuallysplendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettablyneglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days,negative
the duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but theyre no fun to watch and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the pictures caperesque plot,negative
when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spoton english accent,negative
if nothing else itd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt,negative
the story such as it is involves the everbemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climatecontrolling contraption,negative
they also sip a lot of tea,negative
overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant postproduction tinkering its clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds,negative
the avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac its all decidedly uncompelling,negative
mr connery whos onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest,negative
at least it all looks good,negative
this is a genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt,negative
in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain,negative
there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates,negative
by the time the films climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre,negative
not coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movies remarkable trailer a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year,negative
its everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining,negative
a crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies,negative
there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but i sure hope not,negative
spice world is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls,negative
sure theres a hint of humor in there every once in a while,negative
actually theres a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls,negative
but overall who cares,negative
not me,negative
if you dont know by now the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood,negative
in spice world they ride around in their big tour bus whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews,negative
amazingly all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things things they want to do not things they are required to do to keep earning money,negative
and they keep babbling about girl power when they should really be talking about cleavage power,negative
i mean if all it takes is girl power then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits,negative
the film is pg but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions youd have yourself one raunchy adult film,negative
by the way theres something in the opening credits which says based on an idea by the spice girls,negative
wow they got idea credit,negative
i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood,negative
giving credit for simply having the thought say girls lets make a movie,negative
the supporting cast fares well,negative
roger moore the real james bond mockingly plays the clichespewing chief of the spice girls and darn it all hes fun to watch,negative
mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the bands manager richard e grant,negative
one question though george wendt,negative
youd think that spice world would envoke one of two reactions in people,negative
if you like the spice girls youll like them even more afterwards,negative
and if you cant stand them like me then spice world will really make you sick,negative
oddly the audience i saw the film with roughly 50 twelve yearold girls sat in silence for the entire film,negative
well not the two who sat directly behind me,negative
they kept muttering this is stupid over and over again,negative
maybe there is hope for humanity after all,negative
pg,negative
when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart it could mean one of two things that the recently overworked individual is due for a welldeserved rest or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence,negative
the latters the case with john mctiernan and the thirteenth warrior which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring 98 opening and fast on the heels of mctiernans the thomas crown affair remake a flick that got good reviews,negative
you dont have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that thirteenth wont be so lucky,negative
reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton whose eaters of the dead novel provides warrior s source and its initial title this messy melange of cultureclash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish sorta like braveheart without any of the passion,negative
but the bloodshed certainly remains theres enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness,negative
these circa10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside,negative
the good guys are loud crude often unintelligible and judging from their highly icky hygiene habits pretty smelly to boot which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador antonio banderas who tags along quite reluctantly,negative
theyre also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises,negative
youll wince youll groan youll grouse havent we seen this guy killed twice before,negative
banderas stands confused amidst the chaos partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animalskin fashion run amok,negative
hes not the hero his soulful eyes and lean build dont exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions and the thirteenth warrior wisely doesnt pretend he is allowing his foreign and physically imposing costars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough,negative
let the characters interaction sans swords and shields however and theres still a struggle for the audience to follow or even care about the story,negative
it isnt the end until audiences have witnessed a halfbaked romance murky political intrigue veteran actor omar sharif funny girl dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic indiana jones and the temple of doom esque chase through the villains underground lair,negative
all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr but the collaboration between die hard helmer mctiernan and jurrasic park creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights graphic action and unintentionally telling moments,negative
heard during the thirteenth warrior s final scene a dog whimpering,negative
how appropriate,negative
one of the most blatantly obvious signs that oftenacclaimed director sidney lumets gloria a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre,negative
suddenly i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in,negative
when a movie is over arent we supposed to think about it for a while and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with,negative
i thought so but for one i saw this particular picture by myself and 2 even if i had been with someone there wouldnt have been anything to talk about in the first place,negative
to be sure gloria begins with a stirring rather poignant prologue in which a sevenyearold boys family is brutally gunned down by mobsters in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it,negative
right before the men broke in of course his father gave him the disc to escape with,negative
eventually the boy named nicky nunez jeanluke figueroa is caught by the mobsters and taken back to their apartment,negative
meanwhile gloria sharon stone has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didnt commit and returns to her exboyfriend jeremy northam to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime,negative
when he refuses to give it to her and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky she leaves with him in order to save his life but not before holding the men at gunpoint stealing all of their money and forcing them to strip nude,negative
gloria is the type of fasttalking smartmouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people and she never expected to be stuck with a kid but she has a heart of gold dont they always in this type of movie and is only trying to protect the boy whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with,negative
the previous incarnation of gloria by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands remains unseen by me but was no doubt superior even though i cant really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one regardless of the director or stars,negative
there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original but the film itself is simply lifeless with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isnt completely unbearable to watch,negative
i liked for example a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at and keeps turning the car around then driving a little ways then slamming on the brakes and turning around again,negative
these bright moments however appear long and far between and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria which is both painfully predictable and bythenumbers,negative
throughout my mind was repeatedly asking the question who really cares,negative
as gloria sharon stone has adopted an overthetop brooklyn accent that honestly doesnt sound realistic at all,negative
in the beginning in fact i was amazed at how amateurish stones performance was but as the film progressed she got better,negative
although not one of her better turns stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored,negative
jeanluke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag,negative
all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted none more than cathy moriarty an entertaining actress in her own right who is billed fourth and has all of one scene as glorias friend whom she turns to for help,negative
sony the studio that released gloria obviously does not have any faith in the film and i dont blame them,negative
they declined to screen the picture for critics which is never a good sign particularly with the highprofile people involved,negative
although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is just look at the spectacular in dreams which failed to even make the top 10 last week i have a suspicion gloria is going to vanish from theaters faster than ishtar judging from the opening night 7 00 p m showing i saw it at where there were about ten to fifteen people present counting myself,negative
although stone can be an impressive actress just watch her in 1995s casino or 1996s last dance if you dont believe me and sidney lumet can be a respectable director there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of gloria was worth remaking or for that matter why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful,negative
this review contains spoilers as with most of her films director amy heckerlings latest loser seesaws between unpleasant and artificial and is sometimes both at once,negative
when she tackles big issues such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high its impossible to tell whether shes being matteroffact or glib about them they carry an almost documentary starkness but whatever the case she continually refuses to comment politically,negative
such is the sitcom tendency of her work to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button,negative
this fear of drama soured me on fast times look whos talking clueless and now loser in which ms heckerling also demonstrates for the first time zero affinity for the milieu,negative
has anyone for instance ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvaris dora,negative
attired in black thrift her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips she accepts the label of goth but no selfrespecting goth girl ever admitted to digging as dora does those geriatric rockers everclear nor willingly went anywhere with a sixpackwielding fratboy stranger,negative
the mechanics of losers tired old introvertboyfallsforextrovertgirl plot drive its protagonists into cultural nonspecificity so that they become even less than stereotypes,negative
they become walking wardrobes,negative
smalltown transplant paul a strangely static jason biggs our eponymous hero always wears his woolly hunters cap with flaps covering the ears and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldnt scream shemp the lame stooge wig louder,negative
he has three smuglooking roommates the onedimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers but they share similar facial features including and especially mouths and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam,negative
though theyre not overtly transvestites heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy how very cruising of her,negative
the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged,negative
dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions,negative
unfortunately either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated,negative
when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott superb greg kinnear,negative
although pauls already in love with dora by this point as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott,negative
shes thrilled but nevertheless spends a few days at pauls to recuperate the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play cabaret and just when pauls got in his head that shes starting to love him back in that nonfriendly way she decides to become alcotts livein girlfriend,negative
cue precious hommage to the graduate shots of paul drifting around berkeleyer,negative
aside simon garfunkels parsley sage rosemary thyme should never have been allowed in another motion picture,negative
heckerling has a lot in common with nora youve got mail ephron the only other prominent chick directing comedies today in that neither has any use for strongwilled women,negative
men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end in the final scene she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her willmere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned shes cheerily redecorating his apartment,negative
heckerling is so laissezfaire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the wouldbe rapists for jokey epilogue titles,negative
goth veneer aside there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them,negative
heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model and while such arcs may not be heckerlings social responsibility it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes,negative
consider too that dora is the films sole female principal,negative
not that loser is worth contemplating this seriouslygod knows heckerling didnt,negative
that is her hallmark,negative

robin williams is a comedic genus,negative
that is he is one when hes in a film that allows him space to move,negative
flubber straps him in a straitjacket covers him with duct tape stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesnt get out,negative
in a remake of its own 1961 absent minded professor disney offers us proof that more is definitely less,negative
recycling old films that darned cat 101 dalmatians dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared,negative
professor phillip brainard williams is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college,negative
his fiancee sara jean reynolds marcia gay harden president of the college is none too happy with him because hes left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of shortterm and longterm memory,negative
shes giving him one more chance,negative
he blows that chance when he invents flubber flying rubber and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress,negative
his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself,negative
its not all bad news,negative
flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it,negative
brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the towns evil industrialist charles hoenicker raymond barry,negative
while hes busy with his new breakthrough the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft christopher mcdonald,negative
theres a flying car flubberenhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment none of which are the least bit interesting or funny,negative
at one point my son looked around the audience and asked why are these people laughing,negative
although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles he is easily the most lively of the actors,negative
everyone else comes across as halfasleep,negative
the remake is successful in that respect,negative
it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties,negative
i remember the original as being charming but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years,negative
there have been some updates,negative
fred macmurrays flying model t has been replaced by a tbird,negative
his faithful dog charlie is now weebo the hovering robot,negative
the biggest change is that with sophisticated computer animation we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining,negative
flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality,negative
the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number,negative
this has nothing to do with the story,negative
the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys,negative
not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem,negative
there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do dont make sense,negative
the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford,negative
anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions,negative
its unbelievable that his lover well probably not a lover after all this is disney starts dating croft after the aborted wedding,negative
theres not one appealing component of this man,negative
after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball,negative
this guy is beyond forgetful venturing into the certifiable,negative
cowriter john hughes used to direct lightweight but thoughtful teen films,negative
the care behind pretty in pink and the breakfast club all went out the window after his home alone franchise heated up the box offices,negative
looking much like home alone 3 12 flubber even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot,negative
in some ways its difficult to judge this film,negative
i have a suspicion that im not its target audience,negative
after all i measure my age in two digits,negative
the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film,negative
since june i havent been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky shrieking out ahas take on me in his yellow miata,negative
why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine,negative
honestly i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie,negative
man was i wrong,negative
corky romano is one of those throwaway clich ridden tvstartofilm vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots,negative
fortunately for chris kattans precariously positioned career corky does have some good laughs even if most of them are of the lowestbrow variety,negative
kattan plays the title character the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny 80s tunes bright ties and banal coffee mug slogans you dont have to be crazy to work here but it sure helps,negative
when his mob boss dad peter falk is about to be put away on murder charges his bungling lughead brothers peter berg and chris penn rope in innocent black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence,negative
predictably hijinks ensue,negative
if the basic plot sounds bad wait until you get into the innerworkings of this clunker,negative
the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity,negative
corkys fbi agent identity is named corky pissant thats pronounced peesahn,negative
its french,negative
he becomes a firstrate agent by accidentally stumbling mr magoostyle onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations which plays like something out of a sitcom,negative
and not a good sitcom i mean,negative
the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each others face,negative
and in a scene taken straight from theres something about mary corky gives a dachshund mouthtomouth resuscitation,negative
but its not a complete disaster,negative
the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren a german shephard and a kilo of cocaine,negative
plus berg whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie,negative
and its nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work,negative
unfortunately for those out there who cant truly appreciate animal or fart jokes corky wont have much to offer you,negative
so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv asking who is corky,negative
you can simply reply who cares,negative
david spade has a snide sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me,negative
it also served as a good showcase for him when he costarred opposite the late chris farley in tommy boy and black sheep,negative
lost and found marks the comedians first attempt at going solo in a movie and it also reveals that when spade doesnt have a reliable backup system his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect,negative
david spade is not the problem with lost and found,negative
he plays dylan ramsey the sweet main character to the best of his abilities,negative
the story revolves around dylans obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour lila dubois sophie marceau from braveheart and her terrier named jack,negative
dylan believes that the best way to a womans heart is through her dog,negative
and so he kidnaps jack planning to stage a fake rescue in hope to win lila over,negative
there are three good things about lost and found,negative
the first is spade,negative
the second is sophie marceau a lovely actress whos been planted into the wrong movie,negative
lastly theres the dog who is used here in a similar context to puffy from theres something about mary,negative
unfortunately director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute,negative
this kind of physical humor is dead,negative
pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs and this procedure is cheap unfunny and resoundingly cruel,negative
this is where i start to get fuzzy,negative
also in this unusual blend is apparently a sweetnatured love story between dylan and lila,negative
given the meanspirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for i found this hard to swallow,negative
and why does dylan even deserve someone like lila after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain,negative
predictably lost and found opts for a happy ending one that feels so sentimental gooey and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated,negative
david spade who also cowrote the movie tries hard so very hard to make this project amusing,negative
there are some choice scenes that are quite funny but the movie is only sporadically funny,negative
patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over with his good looks and money,negative
jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles,negative
despite a few positive attributes lost and found just doesnt work,negative
if youre searching for an enjoyable romanticcomedy you could do far better than this obvious misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what its trying to present,negative
tina fetch me the axe,negative
a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands,negative
it wasnt just the films disappointing box office performance,negative
indeed in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two three even six times,negative
no the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year,negative
in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming mommie dearest the biggest mommie of them all,negative
executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn but it was all too late,negative
mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history,negative
unfortunately faye dunaways energetic at times ridiculously overthetop performance is about the films only redeeming feature,negative
based on daughter christina crawfords trashy biography mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother,negative
if you believe this movie it was a life was racked by obsession lonliness child abuse and rampant egomania,negative
the film begins with crawford adopting two children and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grownup daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mothers will,negative
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves you see,negative
but thats about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the films end,negative
the script laboured over by four writers a bad sign in itself is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum,negative
frank perrys direction is no more than competent and dunaways bitchy lines aside the dialogue is flat and uninvolving,negative
in fairness the films second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters,negative
when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling joan visits and keeps in touch not helping her financially but encouraging christinas own acting and career ambitions,negative
crawford does seem to care about her daughter but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain,negative
you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers,negative
ah but there is dunaways performance,negative
and what a delicious piece of campery it often is,negative
having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden,negative
she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess shes making,negative
spotting a young tree she doesnt like the look of she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line tina,negative
fetch me the axe,negative
with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling,negative
in the films most outrageous scene joan realises that some of her daughters clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers,negative
oh dear,negative
sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum doesnt it,negative
this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst no wire hangers ever,negative
and later when the board of her late husbands company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring dont fuck with me fellas,negative
oh joy,negative
something of a camp classic then but if thats not youre cup of tea then mommie dearest doesnt have too much to recommend it,negative
better you see the real crawford in the women 1939 mildred pierce 1945 or whatever happened to baby jane 1962,negative
great films distinguished by great performances and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perrys shrieking piece of tabloid froth,negative
susan grangers review of the watcher universal,negative
just what we need another lurid trashy serial killer saga,negative
this time keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome tickingclock catandmouse game with james spader a burntout fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd,negative
to taunt spader who has relocated to chicago reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too,negative
before long he starts mailing photographs of the lonely unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims challenging spader along with the chicago police department to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again,negative
in the midst of this murderous frenzy theres spaders psychologist played by marisa tomei who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in the cell,negative
writers david elliot clay ayers and darcy meyers along with firsttime director joe charbanic helmer of music videos for reeves band dogstar dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase revealing early on exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop need each other to give meaning to our lives,negative
plus as reeves explains were all stacked right on top of each other but we dont notice each other any more,negative
after that its all sound effects and tricky camerawork along with a muddled discordant soundtrack,negative
james spaders acting technique can be described as wooden deadpan while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone dude persona which sometimes works sometimes doesnt,negative
chris ellis as spaders selfimportant colleague is the only cast member who manages to be convincing,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 the watcher is an appallingly awful amateurish 2 the real torture is watching it,negative
in the astronauts wife charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor pixiehairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly,negative
if only her name wasnt jillian the makers of this embarrassing bit of scifi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title rosemarys species,negative
what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron oscarworthy in the devils advocate struggle with the lamest ripoff of a screendom classic in recent memory,negative
ok maybe the astronauts wife deviates from rosemarys baby turf for its setup which finds our heroine terrorized not by satans minions but her possessed husband johnny depp a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him um a changed man,negative
predictably he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great bowfinger line about alien love,negative
therons advocate character faced a similar dilemma the horror there resonating strongly,negative
astronaut provides only artificial anxiety,negative
last years equally noodleheaded species ii spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage,negative
the astronauts wife is grave and humorfree passing its increasingly silly story off as fullfledged serious right down to an ambiguous finale that isnt even going to satisfy those whove stayed with it thus far,negative
heres a hint it involves lots of water electrical equipment a special effect from the abyss and the tots who doubled up as adam sandlers costar in big daddy,negative
draw your own conclusions,negative
rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary e t,negative
cinematographer allen daviau but too often favors the films visual presentation over the story hes trying to tell,negative
this bodes horribly for each dramatic development like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official speed s joe morton to instigate jills slow and stupid comprehension of the truth,negative
his hypererratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge,negative
instead he adds to the phoniness,negative
theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation cider house rules he in the lead of tim burtons eagerlyawaited sleepy hollow,negative
undeserving of such talent the astronauts wife manages to be derivative dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs,negative
in space no one can hear you scream,negative
but in a movie theatre everyone can hear you snore,negative
like a good action film should metro has action that keeps you involved,negative
some action films have action sequences that are so conventional our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts,negative
the ghost in the darkness which opened a few months ago is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving it not only invited my thoughts to divert me it nearly put me asleep,negative
but metro is one of the best action films in a while,negative
it is hip sharp nifty and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy,negative
eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while,negative
and this invites me to mention last year s the nutty professor which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be,negative
metro happens to be a lot better than any film in the beverly hills cop series,negative
that is because metro takes itself seriously but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun,negative
eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible and controlled people,negative
the beverly hills cop movies all featured eddie as a reckless wild cop always crossing the line by just an inch,negative
in metro he plays a hostage negotiator so negotiation is his job not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble,negative
his character in metro takes himself seriously,negative
eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in metro and perhaps it is quite better off that way,negative
murphy plays scott roper and as i previously mentioned he is a san francisco hostage negotiator,negative
in the first tense situation in the film we are introduced to roper s kind of work as he tries to calm down a confused unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up,negative
murphy handles the scene seriously without his usual happygolucky misfit humor,negative
the film develops when its villain is established and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda a jewel thief and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim,negative
metro takes different twists and slight turns and there is one great virtuoso chase scene involving the a cable car,negative
cars flip,negative
cars crash,negative
cars turn over,negative
and it is done so good in this film i was reminded of speed and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons,negative
there are also some other good scenes in metro that a lot of films would rather choose not to have,negative
scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning,negative
of course the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling,negative
the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice too,negative
those are the scenes that make up metro which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality,negative
the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in metro was michael rapaport who plays roper s new partner a lipreading bookskimming genius and a master of observation,negative
it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius,negative
rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really really dopey dimwit,negative
i hardly recognized him in metro and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more,negative
there are two main types of villains in movies like this the ones that are part of the story and the ones that are devices,negative
the villain in metro is no more than a device but he is a darn good villain nonetheless,negative
he is played by michael wincott whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp as if he smokes a cigarette between every take,negative
wincott makes his villain korda as mean as could be the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks like richard widmark in kiss of death,negative
and in addition wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms in the film actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have who is no longer on my good list,negative
i liked metro and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy,negative
his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place possibly from murphy s growing as a person now having a family,negative
metro is a nononsense movie,negative
it works as a buddy movie which it does not overplay,negative
it works as a dry comedy which it does not overplay,negative
it works as a suspense film which it does not overplay,negative
and it works as an action film where it does have a tendency to occasionally go allout,negative
but who cares,negative
it still remains serious and it does not overdo itself,negative
oh and there were plenty of explosions in metro as well,negative
how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those,negative
if there is one major objection i had to metro it was the length an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes,negative
metro is a film that lasted a little too long but it was still entertaining and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end,negative
paul haynes,negative
have you ever been in an automobile accident where youve miraculously walked away with only a few scratches yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable mangled wreck,negative
well that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation,negative
but after watching this inane exercise of a movie i certainly feel that ive miraculously walked away unscathed after a twohour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond,negative
oddly eye of the beholder which is a psychologicalromancethriller starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent called the eye ewan mcgregor working in washington dc,negative
in the humorous opening scene he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down,negative
using an array of hightech surveillance and communications equipment he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office,negative
the law firms employees get a good chuckle,negative
the audience gets a good chuckle,negative
the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ashley judd,negative
there is something compelling about this mysterious woman,negative
despite her glamorous looks however we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her,negative
after the murders she sobs while singing the christmas tune little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago,negative
after each killing she puts on a different wig assumes a new name and then makes her way to another state,negative
the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions,negative
but he does not alert the authorities,negative
he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss,negative
the eye it turns out also is haunted by his past,negative
his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life,negative
his tormented psyche creates a ghostlike image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation,negative
she becomes a sort of spectral adviser and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman,negative
he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation,negative
it doesnt matter that he has witnessed all of her murders,negative
and it doesnt matter that the eye is abnormally reticent hiding his entire life behind computer screens,negative
he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble,negative
when a crazed druggie jason priestley attacks her he shows up for some quick butt kicking,negative
when the police are closing in to arrest her he provides a distraction so that she can escape,negative
all the while the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight,negative
peculiar,negative
how bad is this movie,negative
i refer you to my review quote source litmus test,negative
just take a look at the fullpage ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes,negative
for this movie they are from magazines called flaunt and mirabella,negative
no doubt they were impressed with judds series of catwalks and disguise changes,negative
the major problem with eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward always unsure of its ultimate destination,negative
if it was a thriller there was little to keep us entranced,negative
if it was a love story there was absolutely no emotional pull,negative
completely disjointed in structure its only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial the one where the 6 on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a childs train set,negative
i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents,negative
beyond that the film is hopelessly outofcontrol and is in need of seriously better traction and handling,negative
wow a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever,negative
im amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen,negative
many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race,negative
i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sexcrazed buffoons,negative
even im offended by it,negative
bill bellamy is a player which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them,negative
what a pleasant main character,negative
one day his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player,negative
why they decide this one day i have no idea,negative
how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn,negative
anyway bellamy agrees to teach and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women,negative
this is the bulk of the film folks guys riding from house to house one keeps getting out to have sex while the others sit in the car,negative
since russell simmons is producer and since the official title of the film is def jams how to be a player i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy,negative
amazingly aside from gilbert gottfrieds 90 seconds of screen time there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner,negative
instead of jokes theres just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts and naked breasts arent so bad but naked breasts alone dont make a good movie,negative
be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well,negative
gilbert gottfrieds character serves as one in his very brief appearance asking for explanations as to what is being said,negative
they should have brought him along for the entire film,negative
r,negative
houston we have a serious problem,negative
after making mission impossible brian de palma has a lot to live up to,negative
by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew he hopes to reach the modern audience,negative
and the possibilities are certainly there but the result is a great disaster,negative
starting in a near future with a prologue copied from apollo 13 de palma slowly builds up his story,negative
the human race has already set foot on mars,negative
a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened,negative
this is basically the whole plot,negative
so its hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours,negative
but de palma manages to do that,negative
it is not a very good achievement,negative
as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space the hardest thing to do is stay awake,negative
the films major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is,negative
david mamets dialogue while trying to seem natural is distant and simply fake,negative
de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot,negative
the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubricks 2001 a space odyssey apollo 13 and godzilla,negative
to make time pass the creators have inserted several refreshing scientific details that would not convince a halfcrazed frog,negative
it consists of multiple copies and direct rippoffs from several great science fiction films and stories,negative
when it finally presents an almost original idea it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity,negative
i cant even call this film predictable since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this,negative
sometimes it gets so cheesy that youll start laughing when youre supposed to cry and cry when youre supposed to laugh,negative
youll see enormous sandstorms hear mysterious sounds and last but not least on this constantly surprising tour youll see an alien,negative
its really hard to find comparisons to such an experience and i know that ive never said that before i thought i never would but lost in space is actually better,negative
thats an achievement in itself,negative
director brian de palma has stroke gold with untouchables that became an instant american classic,negative
it is for this film that he will be remembered while all his other failures will be forgotten,negative
hell live to fight another day,negative
i send the actors my condolences since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters,negative
and both the cinematography production design and art direction are very decent,negative
it is because of the achievement of 254 people that i rate this film 210,negative
unfortunately their hard work was in vain,negative
if you have problems with insomnia i recommend you this film,negative
if youre not asleep within the first half hour consult your doctor,negative
mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival,negative
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival,negative
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time,negative
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry,negative
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart,negative
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it,negative
something else is what he did,negative
the film opens with a woman played by laura harring about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life,negative
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep,negative
meanwhile young vivacious betty naomi watts arrives in hollywood from canada,negative
she wants to build a career as an actress,negative
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow,negative
she does not know who the woman is,negative
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is,negative
they fix on a name rita for her but are not sure if this right or not,negative
meanwhile local director adam kesher justin theroux has problems of his own,negative
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else cammie rhodes melissa george,negative
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong,negative
there is also a strange character called the cowboy monty montgomery adding to the confusion,negative
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits,negative
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun,negative
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film,negative
he just chooses not to,negative
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason,negative
there are no earthworms but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches,negative
the film is a little long for the subject matter,negative
toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes clearly not intended for the tv pilot,negative
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers,negative
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
mulholland drive spoiler warning,negative
i have rated this film fairly low,negative
you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film,negative
david lynch is in large part a dark satirist,negative
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside,negative
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre,negative
what he does with this film is are you sure you want to read this,negative
playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on,negative
the first 80 of the film he tells a simple multithread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout,negative
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something,negative
the audience expectation is that they will add up,negative
but he has given clues that are selfcontradictory,negative
lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories,negative
in fact the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation i think lynch is merely playing a joke,negative
there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties,negative
mad magazine called it a poiuyt,negative
other sources called it a tri pronged ubar,negative
look at small portions of it and makes sense,negative
look at the whole figure and it does not,negative
this film is in my estimation the cinematic equivalent of a tripronged ubar,negative
even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality,negative
like everyone else dreyfuss has bills to pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies,negative
consequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorfs tribe,negative
let me start out by saying that krippendorfs tribe is occasionally funny although never riotously so but thats about its only asset,negative
the best word to describe this film is asinine,negative
the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes which are aimed at someone going through puberty,negative
krippendorfs tribe tries to be a zany offthewall comedy but the film makers have forgotten three important rules,negative
the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist,negative
the second is that viewers should be able to identify with or at least care about a character or two,negative
finally and most importantly more than 5 of the jokes have to work,negative
once upon a time james krippendorf dreyfuss was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college,negative
he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a lost tribe somewhere in the wilds of new guinea a goal which they never accomplished,negative
shortly after their return from the failed trip krippendorfs wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael linder on his own,negative
now over a year later the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf which he has spent not on research but on things for his family so they send a new member of their faculty professor veronica micelli jenna elfman to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings,negative
when he arrives at the college for the momentous event rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe the shelmikedmu,negative
to provide video footage he films his children dressed in native garb,negative
soon much to krippendorfs surprise the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon,negative
but one disaffected professor lily tomlin is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud,negative
the only way krippendorfs tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters not to mention the viewers are dumber than dirt,negative
unfortunately its impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this,negative
director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags,negative
meanwhile attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture i e how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend come across as feeble and derivative,negative
the acting in underwhelming,negative
dreyfuss has definitely not given his all to the role of james krippendorf,negative
alongside him jenna elfman the spunky costar of tvs dharma and greg radiates perkiness and little else,negative
this quality while fine for a 22minute television program quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a featurelength movie,negative
no one in the supporting cast lily tomlin david ogden stiers natasha lyonne woody allens daughter in everyone says i love you excels,negative
i know that a movies in trouble when its half the length of titanic but seems much longer,negative
most of what comes on screen is generic sitcom level material the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set,negative
if theres any upside its that i dont see much boxoffice support developing for this lame illmarketed miscue,negative
krippendorfs tribe will quickly become extinct,negative
synopsis a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boys mother a fledgling restauranteur,negative
unsuccessfully attempting to gain the womans favor he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way,negative
comments stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurnedpsychosgettingtheirrevenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry both theatrical and directtovideo,negative
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that theyre typically inexpensive to produce no special effects no big name stars and serve as vehicles to flash nudity allowing them to frequent latenight cable television,negative
stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect the psycho never actually has an affair on the contrary hes rejected rather quickly the psycho typically is an exlover exwife or exhusband,negative
other than that stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable,negative
stalked does not provide much suspense though that is what it sets out to do,negative
interspersed throughout the opening credits for instance a serioussounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk its implicitly implied that all stalkers are men while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen,negative
after these credits a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears,negative
the narrator states that this is the story of daryl gleason and tells the audience that he is the stalker,negative
of course really this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels,negative
if the movie was meant to be about daryl then it should have been called stalker not stalked,negative
okay so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts no guesswork required,negative
stalked proceeds then as it begins obvious obvious obvious,negative
the opening sequence contrived quite a bit brings daryl and brooke the victim together,negative
daryl obsesses over brooke follows her around and tries to woo her,negative
ultimately rejected by her his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate,negative
these plans include the alltime psychoinlove cliche the murdered pet,negative
for some reason this genres films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked,negative
stalked is no exception its a cat this time found in the shower,negative
events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked where only one survives guess who it invariably always is and youll guess the conclusion to this turkey,negative
stalkeds cast is uniformly adequate not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either,negative
jay underwood as the stalker turns toward melodrama a bit too much,negative
he overdoes it in other words but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands,negative
maryam dabo about the only actor close to being a star here she played the bond chick in the living daylights is equally adequate as the stalked of the title even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong independent businessowner,negative
brooke dabo needs to be ditzy however for the plot to proceed,negative
toward the end for example brooke has her suspicions about daryl,negative
to ensure he wont use it as another excuse to see her brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house,negative
does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers,negative
of course not,negative
she tries the door opens it and wanders around the house,negative
when daryl returns he enters the house of course so our heroine is in danger,negative
somehow even though her car is parked at the front of the house right by the front door daryl is oblivious to her presence inside,negative
the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audiences suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either characters intelligence,negative
stalked receives two stars because even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring it is not so bad that it cannot be watched,negative
rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are,negative
if youre in the mood for a good suspense film though stake out something else,negative
this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bonts debut as a director 1994 surprise hit speed,negative
but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead,negative
annie sandra bullock is in the wrong place at the wrong time again,negative
shes going on a cruise with her new boyfriend alex jason patric and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger willem dafoe who has a bone to pick with the shipping line,negative
they sacked him after he got sick,negative
now he wants the diamonds stored in the ships safe for compensation,negative
that actually is the whole storyline,negative
speed 2 could do without dialogues,negative
the movie is all about images and remarkable sound,negative
i dont really know why this is called an action movie,negative
except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies,negative
first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie,negative
then desaster strikes,negative
sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around,negative
i looked for the action but couldnt find it,negative
most of the time she is part of the decoration,negative
the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door,negative
now we know that she can handle a chain saw,negative
we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds,negative
the bomb defusal of course goes wrong but only the furniture is damaged not our heroes who still are needed,negative
jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie helping other passengers and frolicking in the water,negative
his initial seasickness is suddenly gone because there are ship crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger,negative
he does a pretty good job but i cant blame keanu reeves for declining this part,negative
then theres willem dafoe the villain who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankensteins monster,negative
he doesnt succeed though,negative
an untidy appearance isnt enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential,negative
before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror,negative
i cant really recommend speed 2 you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that arent meant to be funny,negative
especially the showdown when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat,negative
there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie,negative
in keeping with last years desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death,negative
a really funny and meant to be funny scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision,negative
some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie,negative
had they looked out the window they wouldnt have missed the huge ship racing toward them,negative
those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects,negative
in an adequately equipped theater its as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate,negative
but the ilm special effects cant save the movie,negative
for all the money they could have done better,negative
im currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters,negative
in the wedding singer she was julia gulia,negative
in never been kissed shes josie grossie,negative
future db character names include janet granite janey grainy and for that nc17 project in the works jojo,negative
aw forget it,negative
ill stick to my day job,negative
this is a teen movie all right except the main characters arent teens,negative
drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter only its very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters,negative
the story shes covering is not really a story but a story in the making,negative
she is to return to high school as a student and explain whats really going on,negative
the irony is that drews character was such a dweeb first time around that she is terrified at going back,negative
when she does she says the wrong things wears the wrong clothes and projects the i know the answer in class that popular kids or at least popular kids in the movies reject,negative
at least she befriends nerdy aldys joan of arcs leelee sobieskiwatch for her who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are supposed to be more beautiful than her,negative
what works drews geeky oldself,negative
after a start in films that was headline driven and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish character its a surprise to see her with bad hair big glasses and braces,negative
its very funny,negative
what doesnt work drews geeky newself,negative
come on,negative
nobody dresses as bad as she does,negative
couldnt she just go to the gap and take suggestions,negative
had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better,negative
the comedy is supposed to progress when drews younger brother played with zest by david arquette reenlists to jumpstart his baseball career,negative
now how in the world can somebody as nerdy but in a funny way as he can be the most popular kid in the school,negative
in a day,negative
the dialogue in the film is well an embarrassment,negative
her coworkers molly shannon john c reilly and gary marshall are in terminal hyperdrive,negative
her teenage peers except sobieski are so inept and stupid that theres little bite from them,negative
couldnt the filmmakers watch heathers first,negative
lastly i am proud to say that i caught a significant gaffe in the film,negative
if you see the film youd know what im talking about,negative
drew walks into a bar has her hand stamped and over the night associates with some rastafarians with some delicious um cake,negative
she goes wild sleeps in late,negative
when she wakes she rushes off to school without showering without noticing that her head lying on her stamped hand all night has transferred part of the stamps image to her forehead spelling loser,negative
funny eh,negative
except that the hand would have transferred that image backwords,negative
its amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest standup around but completely fall flat in the movies,negative
take adam sandler,negative
on the basis of his first two cds theyre all gonna laugh at you,negative
and what the hell happened to me,negative
hes the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams,negative
but when you put him in front of a camera it just isnt the same,negative
i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation but his latest film the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal,negative
seriously im willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here,negative
in fact i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic,negative
the first half hour generated not one smile in me with its scenes of emotional abuse towards adams character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players but also by his very disturbed mother kathy bates what is the world coming to,negative
granted after the film gets rolling there are a few mild chuckles throughout im even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for its nearly hour and a half running time,negative
youre all familiar with the plot because youve seen it at least a million times before everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves,negative
and believe me im not giving anything away by saying that sandlers team wins,negative
if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie then god be with you,negative
the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobbys love interest,negative
i mean they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose but they do extremely well with what they are given here,negative
kudos to both of them,negative
my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen,negative
rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh,negative
or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have like jim carrey did with the recent truman show,negative
with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses he just cant keep going on like this,negative
whats your favorite new york moment,negative
this ones climbing the charts,negative
starring john cusack kate beckinsale eugene levy molly shannon,negative
directed by peter chelsom,negative
rated pg13,negative
theres no doubt that 95 of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern guy sees girl guy wants girl guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl guy gets girl,negative
in rare cases the genders are flipped,negative
predictability is a given,negative
rarely though is a romantic comedy as cheap as obvious or as pointless as serendipity a film that uses its theme as an excuse for its plot contrivances,negative
lightweight doesnt begin to describe it,negative
this is like antigravity,negative
it begins in a new york city bloomingdales a product placement that rivals cast aways fedex for sheer blatancy,negative
jonathan trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale both go for the same pair of gloves,negative
after going through the perfunctory motions jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream followed by ice skating,negative
jonathan falls hard and sara is charmed,negative
when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand,negative
she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldnt be together jonathan is flabbergasted,negative
to pacify him she comes up with an idea jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill which she will promptly spend,negative
when she gets home she will write her name and number inside a book love in the time of cholera and sell it to a used bookstore,negative
if the bill gets back to her or the book to him it will mean that they are meant to be together,negative
three years later,negative
both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests,negative
both realize they arent content,negative
both go looking for the other,negative
what happens now is so absurd that im almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it,negative
the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible coincidences that i would describe as contrivances if it werent for the film ohsocleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around serendipity,negative
of course since the movie is about fate the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases,negative
im not buying it,negative
theres no suspense in any of this because we know exactly whats going to happen but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly adorable nonstory into our heads,negative
instead of will they meet,negative
the question were asking is when will they meet already,negative
to make matters worse every coincidence is telegraphed from a mile away by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else incredible was going to happen,negative
cusack is fine and beckinsale at least isnt saddled with another lumbering clunky screenplay shes had bad luck what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume just an inanely pointless one,negative
serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy who plays a snarky bloomingdales salesman,negative
whats the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined no pun intended conclusion,negative
serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings but it only tests our patience,negative
when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass,negative
toss out your usual objectivity ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it forget how unbearable it was to sit through and find some meaningless way to compliment it,negative
this of course will be of no service to your readers but at least youll avoid the hate mail from the movies fans,negative
thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot,negative
directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love she spent the last one third of her life on film the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez,negative
paulina was a maid in vickys household when vicky was young,negative
i got to learn the films background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present,negative
for those without such context the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film,negative
the acting is amateurish the story is maudlin and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie,negative
grainy and overexposed the movie shot on 16mm film and videotape has little to recommend it,negative
confusingly composed the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story,negative
quite bloody at times the story full of horrific images seems designed to shock and repulse us,negative
why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8yearold paulina,negative
another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her,negative
in retaliation she bites off part of his finger,negative
this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood,negative
the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner,negative
one for example sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body,negative
the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten,negative
certainly she had to endure a miserable life,negative
but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good,negative
i felt trapped in the theater watching it,negative
only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable,negative
paulina runs 1 28,negative
the film is in spanish with english subtitles,negative
it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers,negative
wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day provided of course that youre the victim of a frontal lobotomy,negative
there is in fact no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at moviegoers in their late teens and early twenties the most lucrative target group,negative
this is film noir for the mtv generation fastpaced slick flashy gleefully mindless and hollow to the core,negative
wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998,negative
ive seen more convincing drama with nearly as much bare flesh on that pinnacle of narrative quality baywatch,negative
wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking its a thriller with a real story,negative
what it is however is a series of increasingly improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists,negative
everything in between those serpentine moments is filler a flash of a breast a spatter of blood and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie,negative
the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen and that will probably be it,negative
using this approach i was right three times and wrong only once,negative
thats not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about whats around the next corner,negative
the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie the hot young cast and the old standby sex,negative
both have an abundance of screen time although ill admit that the films erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected,negative
nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu,negative
the softcore sex sequences are generic and dont generate much heat,negative
the lesbian kisses cant hold a candle to those in bound,negative
theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances neve campbell possessing an ironclad no nudity clause in her contract keeps her clothes more or less on,negative
the films greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower,negative
maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fullyclothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick mrs,negative
kevin bacon is familiar with,negative
the director of wild things is john mcnaughton whose last effort was the finelytuned psychological thriller normal life,negative
that movie featured copious sex a pair of real characters and a powerful script,negative
its difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker,negative
but i suppose we all need to put food on the table,negative
mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success his previous widerelease picture mad dog and glory was a boxoffice disappointment,negative
quick cuts and pretty sunrises cant even begin to cover up this movies flaws,negative
the main character and i use that term lightly since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality is sam lombardo matt dillon a guidance counselor at floridas blue bay high school,negative
a student the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan denise richards has a crush on him,negative
one afternoon she comes to his house to wash his car and when she leaves her clothing is torn,negative
after confessing to her mother theresa russell that she was raped she goes to the police station where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubinvega,negative
they are skeptical about here claims until another girl suzie toller neve campbell comes forward with a similar tale,negative
meanwhile sam convinced that hes being set up goes to a shyster lawyer bill murray for help,negative
the acting in wild things isnt very good but none of the principals have much to work with,negative
this is definitely not a character based motion picture,negative
not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a tripledigit i q but it doesnt bother to give any of the onscreen individuals even a hint of depth,negative
the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice but nothing more,negative
matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps,negative
neve campbell gets to model the slutty look,negative
denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a seethrough onepiece bathing suit,negative
and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon,negative
the only one whos even remotely interesting is bill murray and he seems to think hes in comedy not a thriller maybe hes got the right idea,negative
columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the films ending which prompts the question which ending do they want kept secret,negative
wild things has no less than three one occurs during the end credits so stay seated all of which are jawdroppingly absurd a feat that joe eszterhas the writer of basic instinct and showgirls would be impressed by,negative
thanks to jeffrey kimballs polished kinetic cinematography wild things always looks great and george s clintons score keeps it pulsing and throbbing,negative
but no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is this is still trash and like all garbage it stinks,negative
the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities,negative
the best tales of the genre deal with mankinds struggle for survival or knowledge,negative
such popular and noteworthy tomes as stranger in a strange land by robert heinlein childhoods end by arthur c clarke and man in the high castle and do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick all deal with mans need for identity and struggle for self worth,negative
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu if not the message of science fiction since its beginnings,negative
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved,negative
it really wasnt until producer george pal took charge of robert heinleins novel rocketship galileo and crafted the film destination moon that scifi as it is commonly referred to came into its own,negative
from there such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre,negative
with the release of touchstone pictures mission to mars we have an unabashedly nonchalant scifi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe,negative
the film opens on a summer barbecue as phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission,negative
woody blake tim robbins and his wife terri connie nielsen commit to his coming authority on the mission and luc goddard don cheadle consoles his son,negative
entering the party is jim mcconnell gary sinise who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife maggie kim delaney,negative
luc consoles jim with woodys assistance,negative
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them,negative
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet,negative
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars,negative
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface,negative
going out to investigate luc and his team approach the famed face on mars,negative
a strange noise emanates from the rock,negative
as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar a violent wind storm erupts creating a vortex that kills all members of the team save for luc,negative
back on the space station orbiting earth woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing,negative
lucs interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team,negative
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger,negative
meteorite showers explosions and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planets surface,negative
the big question is is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars,negative
and if so what is its relationship with us,negative
now for the bad news,negative
the entire plot of mission to mars is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe,negative
the famed face on mars becomes the centerpiece of the film revealing some of the most harebrained scifi pabulum the screen has witnessed,negative
borrowing ideas from such films as robinson crusoe on mars 1964 quatermass and the pit 1967 2001 a space odyssey and even mario bavas planet of the vampires terrore nello spazio 1965 mission to mars is a hodgepodge of ideas that dont add up to a satisfying whole,negative
while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed the film remains flat and uninvolving,negative
so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film but to no good use,negative
the performances are all workmen like with only don cheadle as luc carrying any sort of real chemistry,negative
gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation,negative
and the mistaken idea of having jerry oconnell as phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse,negative
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better,negative
hes just having too much fun here to give a damn,negative
the script has a few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage,negative
this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship,negative
also when one character sacrifices himself the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation,negative
but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid intrusive score by ennio morricone,negative
subtlety is nonexistent here,negative
in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out,negative
the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower,negative
the pacing of the film is very leisurely,negative
after the opening introduction of the characters which lasts a full 22 minutes we are finally dropped onto the martian surface,negative
then there is another long pause in the plot for more character development including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity,negative
the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum,negative
there are so many scenes of talking heads discussing what we already know is going to happen that it drags the film to a dead stop,negative
the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at,negative
the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring,negative
the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted with a level of realism that hasnt been seen since 2001 a space odyssey,negative
the visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences to the visualization of evolution on earth,negative
the only fault come with the martians themselves which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world,negative
director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film,negative
the opening sequence alone in a seemingly uninterrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes an homage to hitchcocks rope as we are introduced to all of the characters,negative
scenes in the rescue ship with its rotating centrifuge are just amazing in their execution,negative
but the nagging question is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang,negative
sadly it is not,negative
director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production,negative
the set design and visual effects are all arresting,negative
but its the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous thought provoking science fiction,negative
a disappointing film but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals,negative
plunkett macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions,negative
i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking used properly it can save a movie see stigmata but it ruins this one making a muddled incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise,negative
there are certain genres that just dont go together,negative
the film opens with a sequence that i still dont understand,negative
it involves some sort of prison outbreak a robbery and a gem that keeps being eaten,negative
in any case the caper whatever it may be brings together plunkett and macleane robert carlyle and johnny lee miller respectively two happygolucky brits with no way to make a living,negative
they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america,negative
their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca liv tyler a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier,negative
his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name gentleman highwaymen,negative
lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career,negative
he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ken stott who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals,negative
meanwhile macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett who doesnt want his plans to be foiled by his partners mindless romantic travails,negative
director jake scott son of ridley scott alien blade runner has his fathers knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera,negative
most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid jerky way that its impossible to comprehend whats going on,negative
the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity,negative
instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attentiondeficitdisorder edits,negative
he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut,negative
the weird almost defiant lack of dialogue there are no no conversations lasting over say 20 seconds undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters,negative
the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different emotionless and unrealistic,negative
when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film,negative
plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style quite frankly blows the film has no hope of succeeding on any level,negative
i wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldnt it was so kinetic it gave me a headache,negative
often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe o toque do oboe is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray,negative
many elements of the film are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply dont convert into a solid work,negative
although a setting is never established it becomes apparent,negative
the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day,negative
the community is a dull one where every day is a downhill slide from the last,negative
over time the people have taken to themselves,negative
the town cinema is closed no tourist has passed through in years and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger,negative
so what happens when a tourist paolo betti does arrive one day,negative
he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock,negative
it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby,negative
when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years,negative
it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages,negative
the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner leticia vota who also happens to be engaged to the towns police inspector a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiances involvement with this musician,negative
the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray,negative
it features a character who literally rises from his grave a woman who has a phone conversation with god and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character to an almost humorous drunk,negative
technically this film is a nightmare,negative
the music score is poorly edited into the film so it is often choppy rough and abrupt,negative
the lighting is poor at best which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases,negative
this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words,negative
in addition the pace of the film seems uneven,negative
it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test ones patience,negative
the film then moves into a faster pace that again slows towards the end as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark,negative
there was however potential for this film,negative
it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music and the reunification of people,negative
these are all topics that could easily fill a movie,negative
perhaps if there were no freak show and the technical aspects were to improve there might just be a thing of beauty at the end,negative
most importantly though the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours arent such a bore,negative
until then there seems to be little more hope for this piece than that boy has by simply crying out mommy while he wanders astray in a park,negative
you know something christmas is not about presents,negative
its about overhyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tieins,negative
at least that would seem to be the message of the grinch which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores,negative
hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season,negative
you know the plot theres this evil furry green guy called the grinch jim carrey who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville,negative
down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas,negative
the movie is of course a liveaction version of the beloved childrens book which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones,negative
its rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirtyyearold halfhour cartoon but thats the case when jones version is compared to ron howards,negative
the tv grinch hit all the right notes boris karloffs soft deep narration thurl ravenscroft singing mr grinch max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head and the grinchs wide toothless grin,negative
by contrast the movie hits one sour note after another,negative
first there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105minute movie,negative
young wideeyed cindy lou who taylor momsen is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents bill irwin and molly shannon during the holiday season,negative
she begins to sympathize with the grinch who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic,negative
cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class martha may whovier played as an adult by christine baranski,negative
are we expected to like the grinch hate the whos and want him to steal christmas,negative
the grinch isnt even the villain here that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville jeffrey tambor who was the grinchs rival for marthas affection,negative
not only are the characters needlessly complex but the oncesimple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought,negative
the casting choices arent any better than the screenwriting decisions,negative
jim carrey seems woefully miscast,negative
while his face is so supple that the rubber makeup seems superfluous carrey brings nothing else to the role,negative
his accent keeps changing i assume he was shooting for karloff but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon sean connery and cartman from south park,negative
not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinchs home carrey falls back on his standup comedy and clowns around ace venturastyle,negative
needless to say his wisecracking antics dont quite fit the character of the grinch who is an embittered loner filled with hate,negative
little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile,negative
she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story finding santa in her living room stealing the tree,negative
however the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch and momsen is not up to the challenge,negative
bottom line when youre stealing christmas movies leave this one behind,negative
soldier by director paul anderson is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting,negative
the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russels character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision,negative
brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it and the opening scenes tap into it a little,negative
then it goes nowhere with that idea,negative
there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches ive ever seen,negative
the whole idea of the inhuman soldiertype character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done and its been done much better,negative
i was able to predict the plot of the whole story which wouldnt be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting,negative
between the action sequences it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes since his dialog is extremely limited,negative
his performance in that way isnt all that bad but certainly is not enough to carry this film,negative
other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all and they generally are about as weak as their characters,negative
but enough of this stuff about plot and character right,negative
isnt the most important part of an action film well the action,negative
even in this aspect the film is a disappointment,negative
in mortal kombat 1995 director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining,negative
however he fails to repeat that in this film,negative
the combat scenes particularly the big one at the end is incredibly unimaginatve,negative
fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize,negative
but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with it goes for the old shootem up one guy vs an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s,negative
if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film,negative
however it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that making the film a big disappointment,negative
a suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy cliche,negative
a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs cliche,negative
a bad guy who owns a wild animal cliche,negative
a crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type cliche,negative
at an intense moment our main character tries to get away but the car has trouble starting cliche,negative
complaining about cliches cliche,negative
ok ok,negative
so we always hear about cliches,negative
but if there was ever to be a prime example the real mccoy is it,negative
not one uttered word not one frame of film not one character in this whole movie isnt a cut and paste example of everything weve ever seen,negative
they might as well use this as a training film how to make a bank robbery film in the 90s,negative
karen mccoy kim basinger is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a sixyear stay at the state prison,negative
she wants to make things right and go straight especially with the fact that she has a sixyear old son out there who doesnt even know shes alive,negative
aware of mccoys bank robbing expertise sniveling bad guy jack schmidt terence stamp uses the same sixyear old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past,negative
he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier which by the way is somehow due to schmidt,negative
and if she refuses,negative
who knows what hell do to the kid,negative
cue sinister laughter,negative
this movie is so pathetically pitiful that its hard to know where to begin,negative
the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant,negative
i cant stress enough how every single element whether it be a character the dialogue a plot twist etc is so damn generic that youll wonder if anyone is working behind the scenes let alone in front of the camera,negative
basinger is absolutely vacant,negative
and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her,negative
heres someone that spent their time robbing banks and now as she heads onto the street were supposed to feel sorry for her,negative
as she confronts her son who doesnt even know who she is are we supposed to break into tears,negative
especially when neither basinger nor zach english who plays the kid has any depth or emotionalradiance whatsoever,negative
i suppose i should mention val kilmer,negative
yeah thats right hes in it,negative
quite sadly too seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name,negative
and he got second billing,negative
to be fair i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j t,negative
barker,negative
unfortunately the script doesnt allow much room for improvement and when his character is used like bookends he never shows up in the middle of the film,negative
we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project,negative
the real mccoy just cant keep its head above water and soon very soon sinks into a cliched mess of movie,negative
the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer and the dialogue particularly schmidts trite dialogue falls like the niagra,negative
this is definitely one to avoid folks,negative
the real mccoy is anything but,negative
the most absurd remake of 1998,negative
its a toss up between gus van sants psycho and mighty joe young the new disney picture based on the old rko picture,negative
i knew i was in trouble when a polished computergenerated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits,negative
there is no great demand for another giant ape moviemake that ape movie period,negative
witness the quick deaths of buddy born to be wild and congo,negative
and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable its also an assembly line product through and through lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it,negative
theron is jill young as a young girl in the wilds of africa she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers,negative
that baby gorilla nicknamed joe grows to immense proportions and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers,negative
enter conservationist greg paxton who convinces jill to move with joe to california where they can protect him better in a controlled environment,negative
joe is restless at first no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l a plotting joes demise,negative
suffice it to say the movie could have been called joe ape in the city,negative
theron so good in devils advocate and paxton so good in the recent a simple plan are fine actors but not fine enough to transcend the material a paintbynumbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising,negative
the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielbergs the lost world than the 1949 original with the computergenerated trexi mean joewreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third with jill shouting look joes headed for the movie theatre,negative
followed by a shot of joe scaling manns chinese theater a moment later jill shouts again something like look joes headed for an amusement park and what do you know theres joe at the pallisades carnival scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers,negative
the seams of lastminute edits to mighty joe young showunrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves,negative
the movie sure feels uneven regardless act two is underdeveloped while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long long way,negative
underwood tremors speechless was perhaps not the director for the job even the plentiful untamed landscape looks dull in his hands,negative
capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style,negative
i did enjoy certain sequences especially the demoliton of a blacktie dinner sequence and the prologue however implausible is touching,negative
as a tyke joe acts just like e t rick bakers makeup effects and puppetry are outstanding the real star of the showyet for all its technical flawlessness the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love,negative
his facial expressions are variations on a scowl,negative
to be fair i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing childrenits a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue,negative
its certainly not a film for very young kidsintense fighting scenes may scare them while any time joes not on camera may bore them to tears,negative
note older boys are more likely to be dazzled by therons colourful array of tank tops,negative
i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing but they sure dont make em like they used to,negative
a couple of criminals mario van peebles and loretta devine move into a rich familys house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels,negative
however someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them,negative
writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work editing and pacing,negative
it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark but alas there was still 35 more minutes to go,negative
daniel baldwin i cant believe im about to type this gives the best performance in the film outshining the other talented members of the cast,negative
r,negative
virus is the type of cliched vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it,negative
strangely enough on the same midjanuary weekend last year another film was released like this deep rising about an ugly monster on a cruise liner,negative
prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989s leviathan 1989s deep star six and all four alien pictures,negative
virus in comparison is a servicable thriller wellmade and produced but since it doesnt include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on,negative
based on a series of comic books virus concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon,negative
after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking un lucky for them a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen,negative
once the team reaches the russian ship they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted,negative
after turning the power back on however there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself,negative
one survivor finally does turn up nadia joanna pacula who informs the suicidal and stern captain donald sutherland and one of the crew kit foster jamie lee curtis that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out,negative
if virus sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies youre correct,negative
although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life the film itself doesnt appear to have a brain in its head,negative
the film sticks so close to the wornout conventions of the creature genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film,negative
the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play,negative
in her second return to horror in the last year jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine but that is about it,negative
although 1998s halloween h20 was also a disappointment at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character unlike here,negative
donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films such as 1994s the puppet masters although i just watched him in the superb 1978 scifi classic invasion of the body snatchers where he was fabulous,negative
the last of the three topbillers is william baldwin but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture since he has nothing to do,negative
basically virus is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them onebyone,negative
it is not the worst of its type but it is far from one of the best and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this,negative
as long as some of them keep making money i suspect the answer is never,negative
capsule combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark a dash of a jackie chan movie sans jackie two teaspoons of gun and swordplay and a dollop of cgi,negative
simmer for 100 minutes,negative
yields zilch,negative
the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier better movies that after the fifteenminute mark i started cataloguing them out loud,negative
its hard to make a good actionadventure movie that doesnt simply recycle its predecessors and ive seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully,negative
the phantom allegedly based on the longrunning comic of the same name doesnt even bother to be graceful,negative
its a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list but ill try,negative
the film opens up with a prelude sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voiceover to compensate for whatever got thrown out,negative
we go from there to a jungle sequence that i swear to god recycles the truckchase scene from raiders of the lost ark notefornote possibly even shotforshot right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush and then goes on to rip off the ropebridge scene from sorcerer as well,negative
sorcerer as you may well remember was a remake of a french movie the wages of fear in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain,negative
both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick but ive got my job to do so back to the salt mines we go,negative
anyway the cinematic theft doesnt stop there,negative
or at least the lack of inspiration,negative
there isnt a single thing here we havent seen and its not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest,negative
we have wheres my list,negative
a bad girl a tough good girl a secret cave hideaway which seems inspired more by dr,negative
no than anything else a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality magical artifacts of terrible power and caryhiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself,negative
what else is there,negative
the plot is a waste of time,negative
the sets alternate between big but hokey and tiny and still hokey,negative
there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked and im sure once mike and the bots get the cash theyll stick it on their sked,negative
the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane hes a good actor and he tries very hard even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another,negative
all i can say is that i pray this isnt the beginning of the end for him although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comicbook superhero movie,negative
a pseudointellectual film about the pseudointellectual world of art magazines high art is as wasted as its drugaddled protagonists,negative
in the only notable part of the movie ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles not that lisa cholodenkos script or direction makes you care much about either character,negative
living in a world of heroin induced highs they float along until they fall in love with each other,negative
this uninviting picture full of pretentious minor characters has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant,negative
24yearold syd radha mitchell who has a rather bland livein boyfriend was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine frame,negative
although the receptionist is impressed syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ally sheedy,negative
for her to do photos for frame lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her,negative
lucy lives with her current lover a washed up german actress named greta played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson,negative
the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope usually heroin,negative
this does not happen in a single episode but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture,negative
syd who lives in the apartment below them joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club,negative
lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs which apparently is funded by her mother,negative
lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being pigeonholed and since her mother has money we can only assume that thats how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses,negative
a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographers work is transcendental or merely classical,negative
that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny,negative
your work has a cultural currency that is important now is the artistspeak that the frames manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine,negative
when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd her idea of a romantic line is i want to get high with you,negative
in lucys world sex and drugs come handinhand,negative
and the movie except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene,negative
this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions,negative
in another movie it might have worked but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted,negative
high art runs 1 36,negative
it is rated r for explicit sex pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age,negative
flubber is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney,negative
its the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids but anyone else will feel left out as its boring slow and incredibly lifeless,negative
what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water and its a shame because it could have been a great film,negative
hypothetically i mean,negative
flubber as you probably know is a remake of the disney classic i never saw the absent minded professor where a well absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as flubber you know flying rubber,negative
the new one keeps the basic plot but appears to have added a lot else like more absentmindedness on the part of the proffessor some more villains and several showstopping moments like a big rumba with the flubber and some more elaborate setups none which really make it any better but instead make it worse,negative
the basic plot revolves around a college professor philip brainerd robin williams who creates lots and lots of inventions but is sadly absent minded,negative
in fact hes forgotten his wedding to the colleges president sara jean reynolds indie actress marcia gay harden two times before he forgets it again at the beginning,negative
doesnt this warrant some kind of mental treatment,negative
anyway on his wedding day the third one he invents the flubber which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in the abyss,negative
philip believes that this invention once fully realized will save his college which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire chester hoenicker raymond j barry which is ironically enough the same college his brat son will wheaton thought he was dead goes to,negative
through a plot twist hoenickers goons named smith and wesson ha ha what a great sense of humor this film has who are played by clancy brown and ted levine both who needed the pay check discover it the hard way and try to steal for hoenicker who wants it just cause hes evil enough,negative
a subplot involves philips attempts to win back sara whos angry at him and with good reason but who is being seduced by who is basically philips belloq wilson croft christopher mcdonald playing the hysterically suaveyetunsuave asswhole once again,negative
and in another subplot philips daytimer robot weebo voiced by the oneandonly jodi benson falls in love with him,negative
yuckityyuck,negative
whats most pathetic about this film is how dull it is,negative
you dont need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry halfassedly remixing classics or nonclassics for distribution to the general public who sadly eats it all up,negative
earlier in 97 they released jungle 2 jungle an adaptation of a really awful french film un indien dans la ville which yeah improved over the original but not by much,negative
disneys in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now only creatively,negative
in the rush to ship out a film for distribution disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called magic,negative
such scenes as dancing flubber a flying car a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze delight or even cause people to laugh,negative
i sat there the entire film stone faced chuckling perhaps twice and shaking my head at all the bad jokes,negative
who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry,negative
didnt think so,negative
it doesnt help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable,negative
philip is not a lovable absent minded professory just a really dumb man being played by robin williams,negative
williams is a brilliant comic actor okay a brilliant actor in general but here hes given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something and other times act sad,negative
those times hes not bad,negative
but what are we supposed to think of a man whos forgotten his wedding thrice,negative
maybe it was funny respectable in the 60s,negative
i like disney and i usually enjoy their films not only animated but live action and their recent films save for hercules which was good but not great have been worse than lackluster theyve been pathetic,negative
jungle 2 jungle is probably the worst film i saw last year,negative
flubber s probably second,negative
what do they need to do,negative
perhaps create something new,negative
get writers who can write something thats universally entertaining,negative
films like the parent trap and mary poppins are films that are live action or in the latter case a mix of both but even i can still watch them because theyre not only written to be magical to children but to be fun to adults,negative
whats more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn,negative
and my god couldnt they have done something else with edie mcclurg,negative
filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull dreary and overused idea,negative
doug liman swingers director of the ultrahip and severely dark comedy go is an example of just such a filmmaker,negative
in his latest he gives the viewers a raucous neonlit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a druginfested path of misadventure as director,negative
but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multitiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same,negative
his movie is produced anthologystyle telling the same story from multiple three points of view much as an author might write a serial novel,negative
consistent with this ethic liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives,negative
the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter,negative
in story a we have checkout clerk ronna sarah polley looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it in story b we have regular drug dealer simon desmond askew gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity and in story c we have gay soap actors zack jay mohr and adam scott wolf working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal,negative
neither of the three stories have much substance and the movie has the feel of a campfire story albeit a rather strange one that could be told in five to ten minutes,negative
in fact the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length,negative
the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movies christmas setting and the los vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theatergoers to attach themselves to,negative
the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite and performances from littleknown players like polley askew and taye diggs dont help or hurt the roles,negative
in fact even bigger names like mohr wolf and katie holmes dont have enough time to make substantial success,negative
although thats almost expected for lack of continuous screen time the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories,negative
go doesnt have this and it suffers because of it,negative
as far as teen movies are concerned go represents the absolute bottom for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme,negative
the following do not count as common themes drug deals people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them,negative
at times the humor in go is sickly funny and on a low night almost watchable but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night,negative
well as i check my score card for what ive done this holiday weekend it reads good ideas 0 and dumb ideas 1,negative
i dont know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie,negative
but in my defense i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him,negative
the film that im talking about is a night at the roxbury one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit,negative
wayne and garth these two are not,negative
rather we meet doug and steve butabi the actors names are not worth mentioning two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city the roxbury,negative
driving in their dads bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club,negative
have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change,negative
their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pickup lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl let me see that label,negative
just as i thought made in heaven says one of the brothers,negative
and like the losers that they are they fail to do either for much of the film,negative
however as fate would have it an accidental meeting with whateverhappenedto richard grieco gives them the allimportant ticket to get in,negative
their sad lives take on a whole new direction,negative
they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene,negative
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women,negative
but their newfound popularity does not impress their father who has other plans for them,negative
the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a onejoke movie and the brothers are the joke,negative
actually theres about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff,negative
alas too long for tv and way too short for a featurelength film,negative
thus there just isnt enough material to sustain the 83minute movie,negative
theres no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaways europop song what is love,negative
i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash,negative
to take up more film time there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug,negative
this creates not only friction between the brothers but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well,negative
shes educated and a forebearing witch,negative
meanwhile doug is a complete loser,negative
how did these two ever get together,negative
i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question ill have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie,negative
if youre looking for entertainment you wont find it at the roxbury,negative
arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar go to the movies fall in love move in together etc,negative
review,negative
well if you havent seen when harry met sally or he said she said or if you dont watch love war on television you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages,negative
however if youve seen any of these than you have seen most of this film,negative
this of course doesnt mean its bad,negative
some of it is amusing but overall i just had to ask whats the point,negative
arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love,negative
kevin pollack is the stereotypical femalefearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes most if which werent very funny,negative
couteney cox is the stereotypical careerminded woman who falls in love,negative
julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman,negative
notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical,negative
this film uses a lot of formula the plot is basically known from the opening credits,negative
so what is good about the movie,negative
well as i said there are a few amusing moments,negative
surprisingly julie brown who i usually find just plain goofy was the best thing in the film,negative
also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual,negative
gee this is really short,negative
not much to say about the film really,negative
it is just kind of there,negative
watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time but i wouldnt recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre,negative
has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears,negative
nineteen years and two mighty ducks later the formula is still going strong,negative
police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a smalltown deputy sheriff corralled into cocoaching the schools hastily formed soccer team,negative
his partnerincrime is the new british exchange teacher olivia dabo a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested outercity audience is to teach them something neat,negative
like soccer,negative
most of the goodnatured gags are of the fastmotion variety such as runaway cows and outofcontrol lawnmowers,negative
kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit while their parents peacefully doze beside them,negative
other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed whats missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy,negative
instead of a peppy pop score which would arguably work to better effect most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else,negative
comedy needs music,negative
just watch any old bugs bunny short,negative
the marx brothers knew it,negative
mel brooks knows it,negative
unfortunately the current trend is to overscore,negative
lush strings and booming brass in every scene at every moment,negative
remember the simple strains of bizets habanera in the original bad news bears,negative
these days its usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path,negative
much like adding frosting to already frosted cake,negative
an awfully big adventure,negative
the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral,negative
their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern georgina cates struggling to survive in postw w ii,negative
liverpool,negative
hugh plays the gay director an extremely unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months,negative
bleak makeup and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into,negative
an awful adventure is not without some rewards tho,negative
the peter pan subtext is intriguing,negative
as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth alan rickman and prunella scales,negative
basil,negative
devil in a blue dress,negative
the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough except for the fact that this film isnt nearly as gripping,negative
carl franklin one false move is the force behind this accomplishedbutstiff adaptation of walter mosleys crime novel,negative
denzel washington is as sturdy as ever but hes burdened with a miscast supporting cast,negative
tom sizemore and scenestealer don cheadle are both fine,negative
the problems start with jennifer beales who never registers as the plots femme fatale,negative
shes a pretty face and nothing more,negative
also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney,negative
they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles,negative
john huston we miss you,negative
fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus,negative
they help to overcome a pace thats too polite for mosleys jazzy swingin story,negative
steal big steal little,negative
i cant say much about this one,negative
director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers andy garcia with opposing moral codes,negative
theyre fighting over their adoptive mothers estate a 40 000acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers,negative
so many different plots are trying to come togetherfeuding brothers reconciling husbands loanshark hired hitmenthat you have to admire the directors ambition,negative
too bad that almost every single person or plotline is out of sync,negative
that is with the exception of alan arkin,negative
hes the best thing in a movie thatdespite the work of four credited writers still manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers kevin mccarthy and joe pantolinao,negative
and what the heck does that title mean,negative
it seemed like the perfect concept,negative
what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality,negative
its exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh,negative
jim carreys signed on too,negative
even better,negative
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth,negative
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldnt take a joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy,negative
yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isnt funny,negative
its not for lack of trying,negative
the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them,negative
this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult,negative
soon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second independent personality named hank a deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster,negative
this guy isnt above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which hes been insulted or holding a little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street,negative
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks,negative
some have suggested that this isnt a problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work,negative
theyre wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996s theres something about mary,negative
1999s outside providence was technically an earlier project,negative
the brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected,negative
in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleightofhand trick theyd have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion,negative
me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work,negative
having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment,negative
the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes,negative
but they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy,negative
the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p waters renee zellweger whos in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending thats entirely predictable from the getgo,negative
think charlie and irene will fall in love,negative
yeah me too,negative
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you havent already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be,negative
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value its no longer funny merely gross,negative
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry,negative
take for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon,negative
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face,negative
but by the end of the film theyre still doing the same schitck it hasnt been elevated to another funnier level and it hasnt been dropped either,negative
thats too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through,negative
me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities,negative
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions,negative
this doesnt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it,negative
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesnt go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax,negative
jim carrey is a gifted comedian both physically and vocally but hes left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in all of me,negative
its a great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny,negative
carrey doesnt pull any stunts we dont expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesnt give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting arent set up in any meaningful way,negative
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better,negative
zellwegers irene is not a strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled,negative
irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether shes ditzy clever or neither,negative
as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film,negative
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this,negative
he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected,negative
after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves,negative
maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked,negative
but i dont believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style,negative
if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and i still think they are theyll rebound just fine,negative
even after that happens though ill still consider me myself irene to be a highcaliber misfire,negative
m i2 the sequel to mission impossible is a james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value,negative
it tries to be a movie but without any suspense the film just looks like its an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses,negative
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human,negative
the coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols,negative
the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence,negative
except for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for threequarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed,negative
as for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen,negative
m i2 opens and closes with fastpaced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue,negative
the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus at that point,negative
the only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way,negative
its a megabuck film adapted from a popular hightech gadgetry tv series,negative
but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it and it failed to produce a story that had any substance,negative
john woo broken arrow is good at doing car chases choreographed fights with midair flips and kungfu kicks slomo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just cant seem to handle dialogue and suspense,negative
the star of the film and coproducer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast,negative
cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an actionfilm girl and seems like a fish outofwater in this one,negative
their romance didnt work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it wasnt convincing,negative
the film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success,negative
we will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville,negative
first we are in sydney australia where a scientist with a muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it,negative
he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain,negative
which explains the films mythic theme as,negative
we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil,negative
the one who played the villain dougray scott does so in a onedimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role,negative
at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense,negative
soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains,negative
before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott a rogue member of the imf which is a cialike clone,negative
he steals the package with the antidote peels off a latex mask which is a replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust,negative
sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices,negative
we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted a plot as that film had it was still a superior film to this sequel,negative
woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this film by both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain,negative
it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense,negative
next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via a rocket launcher a pair of talking sunglasses,negative
hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running a highgadget computer but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team,negative
he is told as an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped,negative
hopkins then signs off with the tag line this message will selfdestruct in five seconds,negative
actually with the departure of hopkins it was this disposable film that actually selfdestructed at this point,negative
in seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road,negative
he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal and learns that she is valuable because her exboyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f ck her,negative
the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f ck him as she leads them to his hideout in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh,negative
robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes a colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in a camp way,negative
the terrorists who aim to rule the world are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock,negative
ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first,negative
ethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder seans getting it as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle,negative
ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle using kickboxing winning a shootout throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kicks everyones ass,negative
if i was only entertained by this i,negative
could have lived with it,negative
but this film was so badly made that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game seeing only the slamdunks but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast,negative
in any case this is a criticproof film and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into,negative
from dusk till dawn robert rodriguez screenwriters quentin kurtzman story cinematographer guillermo navarro cast quentin tarantino richie gecko george clooney seth gecko juliette lewis kate fuller harvey keitel jacob fuller ernest liu scott fuller salma hayek santanico pandemonium tom savini sex machine fred williamson frost cheech marin border michael parks texas ranger brenda hillhouse hostage gloria runtime 108 dimension films 1996,negative
reviewed by dennis schwartz,negative
its a love it or hate it film,negative
i simply hated it,negative
on its menu for fun is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongueandcheek manner,negative
its a serial film farce of nonstop overthetop action and sleaze involving decapitations vampires biker fights extended gun play and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed,negative
a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for bloodandgore as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich s of the conventional bfilms,negative
its geared only for the cult film crowd and will make its mark there one way or the other,negative
the plot involves two psychopath brothers the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko clooney and the perverted psychopath killer richie tarantino who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist,negative
they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town,negative
they have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops they have also taken a middleaged bank teller as a hostage,negative
in the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk and burn down the store,negative
stopping off in a flophouse motel richie rapes and slaughters the hostage,negative
these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody if thats possible,negative
on the tv news it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers,negative
the brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos cheech who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take,negative
with road blocks and car searches at the border the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed,negative
there is the father jacob fuller keitel who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident his sexy 20yearold innocent daughter kate lewis and her shy brother scott liu,negative
its not explained how he happens to be chinese,negative
the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a for truckers and bikers called the titty twister,negative
the place is open from dawn to dusk thus the films title,negative
heres where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout,negative
it sells sex to its patrons and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium hayek do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire,negative
the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the films staple,negative
this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings,negative
ill take a pass on this one its just not my style of a film,negative
the characters were as empty as the story and the film was an easy one to forget,negative
august and september are a wasteland when it comes to childrens films and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios dont want to see slaughtered against familyoriented thanksgiving films,negative
last year the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon and this year they bestow max keebles big move on delighted moviegoers across the country,negative
parents will be thrilled because theyll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesnt smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did,negative
dont get me wrong keeble which is actually only a ment away from being a fetish film isnt that entertaining,negative
in fact youd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics monsters inc harry potter come out next month,negative
but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy then youd better do it because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isnt going to cut it,negative
we first see young max keeble alex d linz home alone 3 as a pintsized superhero delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man jamie kennedy jay and silent bob strike back and landing the neighborhood honey brooke anne smith who by the way is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day,negative
the scenario is of course a dream,negative
max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude no luck with the ladies and only two friends both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts and who were both in snow day the perpetually robed robe josh peck and a clarinetplaying cutie named megan summer catchs zena grey who harbors secret feelings for max,negative
things dont get any better for max when he arrives at school,negative
he has to contend with among other things a redhot science teacher amber valletta family man a pair of polaropposite bullies noel fisher and orlando brown and an illiterate principal larry miller the princess diaries whos secretly diverting the schools last dime into the football program,negative
when maxs father grownup nerd robert carradine unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off,negative
whoa dont worry parents,negative
he doesnt do it kleboldharris style,negative
its all pretty tame stuff but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings,negative
director tim hill muppets from space adds a few nice touches like maxs voiceover character introductions for the films main characters and a flashback scene thats pretty funny but there isnt too much else happening here stylewise unless,negative
you count some farting a little puking and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk and lil romeo,negative
1 30 pg for some bullying and crude humor,negative
i think we should as responsible citizens all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie,negative
hes changing the cinema as we know itand for the worst,negative
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic momentsprologues epilogues etc the premise a lawyer cant lie for a day,negative
ho ho,negative
normally a movie made from this premise would be terriblemr,negative
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable,negative
i laughed onceand i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing,negative
grinding doesnt begin to describe,negative
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that if you are a normal person you leave feeling sick,negative
when its not trying to be funny its trying to be melodramaticbut its just annoying stupid and sappy,negative
at best,negative
this movie is intended to make people laugh yes not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound,negative
but it fails on every possible level,negative
it fails to be funny,negative
it fails to be insightful,negative
it fails to be suspensful,negative
it fails to be fun,negative
they should pay people to see it,negative
it suceeds on one levelit makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles for having lived,negative
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive please make sure that you are overly fond of boob fart pimple and fat jokesotherwise you will go insane,negative
yes literally insane,negative
stark raving mad,negative
it is boring stupid melodramatic and in the end ugly,negative
i reccemond it strongly,negative
to ed wood,negative
the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars,negative
producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze,negative
gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry,negative
cage is legendary retired car thief memphis raines dont you love cute movie names who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thickheaded brother ribisi from being killed,negative
seems a murderous crime boss eccleston with a fetish for wood insert your own joke hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive exotic autos,negative
fifty cars to be exact,negative
poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly,negative
if the cars arent delivered in three days bossman has a casket carved out just for kip,negative
literally,negative
if only someone could save him,negative
hmmmm wonder,negative
what memphis is doing,negative
in order to give the film some emotional heft there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of yawn excuse me dramatic tension,negative
shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe lindo whos looking to send memphis away,negative
will he catch him,negative
theres old flame sway jolie who had her heart broken by memphis years ago,negative
will they get back together,negative
shortsighted thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother yet resents him for moving away from the family,negative
will they reconnect,negative
raines old mentor duvall has long since left the life of crime,negative
will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life one more time,negative
can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first,negative
ill bet you can,negative
following the opening credits which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis,negative
hes first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive gocarts,negative
in a later scene as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control all the while making breakfast a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions,negative
just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it,negative
looks like everything might turn out alright after all,negative
you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins,negative
thats about as strong as the characterization gets which is a shame,negative
bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand,negative
monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis,negative
or maybe its just the cars,negative
duvall trots out his ornery but sweet old codger outfit,negative
im sure hes still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one,negative
lindo projects a warm hearted but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material,negative
the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones who plays a mute accomplice of memphis,negative
without saying a word he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie,negative
like a blast of nitrous oxide he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal,negative
too bad his minutes onscreen are so few,negative
somehow bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept poorly written movies gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes,negative
every time something clever happens its counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing youre watching a movie,negative
theres a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot,negative
its counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a drivers test,negative
imagine the yuks,negative
theres a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick,negative
its countered by the lame semisubplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk,negative
the ramifications are never explored,negative
then theres the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars,negative
not only is it stupid but its against the law,negative
this is a movie made of pretty but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along,negative
gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long itll take for this marginally entertaining but empty film to leave your memory,negative
director doug ellins kissing a fool released earlier this year is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story,negative
like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it the movie meanders along insulting the viewers intelligence in almost every frame,negative
the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines youve heard before,negative
im not wearing any underwear the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster max in what she assumes will be a surefire comeon line,negative
max chicagos biggest playboy decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam short for samantha,negative
max and sam possess two irritating personalities and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience,negative
max is played without any style by david schwimmer,negative
schwimmer whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality makes an unlikely lover,negative
his costar mili avital as sam is cut from the same cloth so they can be argued to be a matched pair,negative
after all people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other ditto for similar looks so why shouldnt the personalitychallenged be attracted,negative
the implausible plot has max asking his best friend jay jason lee to hit on sam as a test,negative
jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him but stop short of the actual act,negative
max being promiscuous by nature worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does,negative
the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work,negative
neither the script nor the actors make this test believable,negative
the 64 000 question is how do you know youre with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life,negative
jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film,negative
finally there is the films attempt at physical comedy,negative
jays exgirlfriend natasha vanessa angel becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else,negative
natasha rips jays shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa,negative
as she throws her hair on his bare chest she demands he pull it,negative
this is supposed to be funny,negative
most films have some saving grace,negative
some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasnt,negative
kissing a fool on the other hand has nothing to recommend it,negative
kissing a fool runs 1 45,negative
it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers,negative
my friend here in film school just made a two minutelong film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration,negative
as sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments ive ever witnessed,negative
sure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest,negative
then theres caligula,negative
this film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio of both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies a greasedup fist forced up a mans rear wine poured down a man whos had his urinary tracts tied off a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well be a respectable film and if could have been had the following not occurred a the events were graphically shot in clear view b the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to well show historical accuracy c the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets a rather impressive cast and a whopping 2 12 hour running time,negative
produced and funded by none other than bob guccione owner of penthouse magazine caligula comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan 9 from outer space because underneath theres a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining,negative
after all its not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry,negative
no film should be discarded because its content because film is never about what its about its about how its about as the old cliche goes,negative
those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with caligula and thats that its nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time,negative
caligula allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing or,negative
so i guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons,negative
the film opens on the wrong note of course with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the overused passage what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer fucking around with his own sister in a field i suppose if one has to lose their soul one has to have a soul in the first place,negative
the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell a performance that does the opposite that his performance in a clockwork orange did is next in line for the throne but cant wait for the current emporer tiberius peter o toole ditto only for his performance in lawrence of arabia his grandfather to die so he kills him and ascends to the throne,negative
then he abuses his position marries a woman helen mirren who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting so he doesnt just have to sleep with his sister a dreadful teresa ann savoy there to be pretty naked and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with abuses his position a little more a little more and a little more and then i believe invades england then is killed off,negative
the filler instead of recounting his life is supposed to be as guccione claims the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome complete with orgies vicious deaths and lots of nudity,negative
but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be it instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like,negative
oh isnt it great that they just loved having sex,negative
and that they killed people so disgustingly,negative
and wouldnt it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though its so blatantly real bad porn that ive completely convinced myself that its not,negative
i mean why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up,negative
and its not just that its disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film its that in a film where the entire feel its going for isnt felt its also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time,negative
the sets are lavish but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this,negative
but that doesnt matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark,negative
the camera operation is also the worst ive ever seen in my entire life,negative
not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out of focus,negative
the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow,negative
there is no writer to speak of what the hell does it mean that its adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue is shit so laughably bad that i cant in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius he could go at any moment but with care he could last a year or so,negative
the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio of spartacus and phrygia ad nauseum used in an attempt to give the film some emotion but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere,negative
the orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result of reshoots by guccione himself which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment every five seconds or so the film cuts to random nudity as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated x,negative
john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra im going to kill my agent im going to kill my agent,negative
and so on and so on for over 2 12 hours making caligula about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying,negative
guccione in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage,negative
throughout the entire film the presence of guccione is easily felt as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen pretentiously looking down upon us saying look what i can get away with,negative
and if you dont like this then youre a prig and worse than that you know nothing about history,negative
uh huh,negative
theres a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something thats artistically good,negative
a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for a good film,negative
but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts is total total bullshit and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this film,negative
theres a film that came out in 1989 called the cook the thief his wife and her lover a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren which deals with graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even a little cannibalism for good measure,negative
that film not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them in a way that was shocking yes but also in a bizarre way entertaining and totally involving,negative
there were real characters there in a real situation and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that its going to be offensive to many,negative
that film achieved everything it wanted to do and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good,negative
and its everything caligula might have been but alas wasnt,negative
five years after his directorial debut based on stephen kings writings called the shawshank redemption 910 frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king,negative
unlike the latter film this one is a big long laborious bore,negative
plot a sevenfoot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers,negative
critique this film is slow drawnout boring uninteresting unexciting predictable and topped with a couple of onedimensional evil characters,negative
its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles,negative
the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about,negative
of course much like all other death row cell blocks this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be misunderstood except for one cookiecutter crazy guy who is evil personified,negative
and lets not forget all the guards on death row who also happen to be angels from the heaven above except for one cookiecutter crazy guard who is also evil personified and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates,negative
am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film,negative
or even more importantly am i supposed to give a rats ass about anyone in this film,negative
well if i was i sure missed that boat because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin,negative
furthermore there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyones life to present this story,negative
in fact the story is empty within itself,negative
i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not,negative
wow,negative
how interesting,negative
the plots utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie,negative
whip out those thinking caps kids,negative
hmmm and i wonder what will happen to those two cookiecutter evil guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity,negative
hmmmm now think hard here boys and girls,negative
what a crock,negative
i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some threehour exercise in spirituality but unfortunately for me it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging,negative
in fact it was one big bore,negative
i didnt see the point of the movie i didnt see the point of the story and i certainly didnt see the point in tom hanks big doublechin,negative
all in all a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour john coffey,negative
give that man an award or something,negative
call it a road trip for the walking wounded,negative
stellan skarsg rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that its difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly boozedout presence,negative
yet this everreliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama,negative
playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late,negative
thats an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father tomas skarsg rd and his alienated openly hostile yuppie daughter kaisa lena headey gossip,negative
they havent spoken in years and wouldnt even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen scotland by automobile if it werent for kaisas mother charlotte rampling under the sand rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer,negative
in a soap opera twist mother has only a few days to live,negative
only in the movies right,negative
too blitzed to even step foot on a plane tomas hits the open road with kaisa,negative
loathing each other all the while they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out whenever he isnt muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be,negative
despite his sloshed viewpoint tomas recognizes that the apple hasnt fallen very far from the tree,negative
kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke sabotages her personal relationships through indifference and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper,negative
aint they a pair,negative
unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the onenote and repetitively bitchy dialogue screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward lost money roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around nosy cops and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative,negative
by the time they reach the hospital its time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the fatherdaughter conflict theyre also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe,negative
this revelation exists purely for its own sake,negative
aberdeen doesnt know where else to go,negative
weak unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa,negative
if lena headey were a stronger actress perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody haunting cinematography rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional,negative
headeys too busy acting using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance,negative
if she were paying any attention to skarsg rd maybe shed figure out that doing less can reveal so much more,negative
its worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 jonathan nossiters captivating signs wonders,negative
its not just because skarsg rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films theyre not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen,negative
the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant,negative
in aberdeen rampling is a luminous diva preening and static in her hospital bed,negative
despite skarsg rds solid performance as tomas his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow,negative
theres genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs wonders allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity,negative
nossiters film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain,negative
if signs wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas at least its willing to stretch beyond what weve come to expect from traditional drama,negative
aberdeen is never half so ambitious content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies,negative
when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life,negative
the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdans trite but occasionally useful grand canyon where steve martins hollywood mogul pronounces all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies,negative
even foreign films are taking that advice to heart,negative
synopsis two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry woody harrelson an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye has illtimed fits of coughing and fails at everything he does,negative
the story is told from harrys point of view,negative
harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesnt drink,negative
one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea elisabeth shue who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesnt smoke,negative
seduced harry agrees to participate in a moneymaking scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette chloe sevigny the teenage daughter of a rich man,negative
turns out its all part of a needless very puzzling extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme it involves hiring special impersonators by two cons in order to fool harry a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post,negative
when the kidnapped odette is found dead the clues point to harry as the and the police are hot on harrys trail,negative
harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money,negative
can he get out of this mess,negative
opinion palmetto is a long uninteresting film with all the wrong feel,negative
hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence,negative
this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof,negative
but palmetto is played like a dark serious detective noir drama and watching harrys bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction,negative
theres a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts buttocks short skirts colored painted nails and womens legs,negative
even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema you can always notice the side of elizabeth shues breast forming a prominent foreground,negative
towards the end palmetto refocuses on plot for the grand finale a confusing explanation involving impersonators with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession,negative
if you can imagine shemp from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo lingerie suspense thriller thats how out of synch this movie feels,negative
the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canines least appetizing residue,negative
the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector,negative
my vote goes for the ending credits where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you,negative
ibn fahdlan antonio banderas is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another mans wife,negative
he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men,negative
fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter,negative
the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas whos acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993s philadelphia than that of a warrior,negative
in the films supposed pay off scene he exclaims i was wrong these are not men,negative
a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production,negative
unfortunately banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chases career look like oscar material,negative
the film based on michael crichtons best selling novel eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow,negative
at the same time the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions,negative
questions like why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark,negative
why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face but rather just one side,negative
and finally will the manager give me a refund,negative
90 minutes into the 103 minute film a man invites of the warriors come with me there is a woman who can help,negative
unfortunately there is nothing that could help this film,negative
the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands form a chorus line and break into a rendition of springtime for hitler,negative
this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disneys live action george of the jungle,negative
tarzan and the lost city the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burroughs legendary hero to the big screen is one of the most inept and illtimed of any tarzan adventure so far,negative
badly conceived and poorly executed tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves,negative
i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan its not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie,negative
furthermore its even more curious that this film is rated pg which by definition rules out any sex or explicit violence,negative
and while im not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production,negative
of course no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city since the films troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line,negative
imagine george of the jungle stripped of all intentional humor and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like,negative
with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences the film barely registers a pulse,negative
anyone in search of a relatively entertaining family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book which uses the same basic elements to much better effect,negative
the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery which unfortunately includes the two lead actors,negative
the film doesnt attempt to retell the origin story the thinking is that it has been done often enough,negative
instead tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a k a john clayton a k a tarzan the ape man casper van dien several days before his marriage to lady jane porter jane march,negative
he is living happily in england enjoying the benefits of being a landowning noble,negative
meanwhile in central africa the dastardly nigel ravens steven waddington a selfproclaimed scholar and explorer believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar which he calls the cradle of civilization,negative
on the way there he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things like burning native villages to earn the wrath of the locals,negative
one shaman determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal sends a mystical message to tarzan for help,negative
with lady jane following close behind he returns to the jungle where he was born,negative
its patently obvious that casper van dien one of the prettyboy heroes of starship troopers was not hired on the basis of his acting ability,negative
with his plastic facial expressions monotone voice and complete inability to make convincing animal noises his range rivals that of steven seagal,negative
his pecs however are impressive and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off,negative
jane march on the other hand has to keep her shirt on which may be a first for her,negative
some six years ago march give a solid performance in jean jacques annauds steamy the lover,negative
since then she made the careerkilling decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night which exploited her every acting defiency,negative
tarzan continues this trend,negative
march may be attractive but at least judging by this performance she cant act,negative
meanwhile steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy,negative
instead he turns out to be little more than a nuisance,negative
the story line is pure formula which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies,negative
the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless,negative
the romantic elements are all contrived in fact lady janes presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance,negative
the special effects are truly bottomofthebarrel including some laughably bad men in ape costumes apparently animatronics were too expensive for this production,negative
and of course as with all jungle movies there are the obligatory cute animals,negative
over the years the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material,negative
the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part including gordon scott who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role,negative
weismuller made 12 tarzan features van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number,negative
and having seen tarzan and the lost city i would argue that the moviegoing public would have been well served if he had missed by 12,negative
this movie is based off the wildly popular videogame series of the same name,negative
before this film the game had a few spinoff cartoons which were ok,negative
but the idea of doing a movie is insane,negative
it should have been animated if it should have been done at all,negative
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast,negative
yet it still fails,negative
the plot is completely different from the games plot im not complaining about that,negative
the story involves the mario bros having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company,negative
eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis which happens to be enviromentally unsafe,negative
so due to luigis john leguizamo girlfriend princess daisy they go and investigate,negative
they get transported to a blade runneresque world lead by king koopa dennis hopper,negative
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic megacity jumbles in,negative
the plot is fine better than the movie deserves,negative
the acting is ok,negative
this seems to be more of a visual film,negative
the special effects are good especially on the robotic yoshi,negative
however the film drags and is no fun,negative
and it leaves itself open to a sequel which probably wont ever be made,negative
this movie begins sort of promising but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth,negative
so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper then watch super mario bros,negative
the movie,negative
you could do worse,negative
but you could definitely do better,negative
street fighter the movie 1995 starring raul julia and jean claude vandamme,negative
this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot,negative
it is more like a movie than it should be,negative
yes its watchable,negative
raul julia does a good job considering this was his final film,negative
while the game had nonstop fighting sequences this movie is a hodgepodge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time,negative
does it work,negative
sort of,negative
the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m bison raul julia,negative
guile jean claude vandamme takes his troops to attack bisons main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over,negative
in a short amount of time the movie introduces several characters well,negative
it catches your attention,negative
but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like theres chun li,negative
or look at that fireball ryu did at vega,negative
it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets but goes no further,negative
this movie needed more action in the first place,negative
the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting,negative
if you like lighthearted action flicks or if you liked the game watch this one,negative
it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julias last performance or if you cant get enough of van damme,negative
other than that you could find better action flicks,negative
the premise of turbulence is im sure very familiar to us all,negative
weve seen it before in passenger 57 executive decision and countless other flicks that are good in there own way,negative
you know terrorists take over a plane ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on,negative
turbulence starts out with a convict ray liotta being accused of a crime,negative
you think there is no way he could have done it hes so open and kind,negative
he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la,negative
this is already a problem,negative
there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on,negative
anyway it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there,negative
well convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial tracks and liotta still as calm as ever takes the other convict out,negative
he also has eyes for lauren holly a flight attendent and seems to grow closer to her,negative
the plot stops here,negative
i didnt like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie ive ever seen,negative
at one point mr liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining im serious,negative
it was like they stole for every other movie down to a t,negative
the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts,negative
dont even bother,negative
the great actor james woods once said and im paraphrasing if sex isnt messy then youre not doing it right,negative
a truly profound statement and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre just replace sex with your mad slasher film,negative
for those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre or subgenre is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween,negative
urban legend is a mad slasher flick but one that is so sanitary bloodless and nudity free that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful though not overly talented cast it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special,negative
for film makers gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale frightfree horror movie as stephen king once said again paraphrasing if you cant scare your audience gross em out if you cant do that make em laugh,negative
alas urban legend succeeds only at the latter though not by intention,negative
i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success 40 million domestic box office gross more frightening than anything in it,negative
it seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt,negative
the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them,negative
unfortunately these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations one idiotic superhyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films dont need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering,negative
if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla,negative
but forget all that it goes without saying that mad slasher films or any other exploitation offshoot will be made without an ounce of craft especially considering the sheer volume that are produced,negative
allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film the lack of enthusiastic exploitation,negative
these flicks arent harnessed with any lofty aspirations so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time,negative
sadly out of the literally hundreds made i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while,negative
and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three,negative
despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes,negative
as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legends setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities it takes place on a college campus which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer,negative
you see the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface,negative
all those young people are growing up together going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows so naturally some weirdness is expected,negative
all the better for that elusive crazed killer,negative
coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task,negative
but alas urban legend is not only idiotic and clich full its way too clean a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity little gore and much stupidity,negative
this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than i dunno exercise,negative
its the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a runninglikethewindprey yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques,negative
its the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack,negative
i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loudnoisejumpscare thing,negative
yes the audience jumps momentarily frightened but wouldnt anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room,negative
i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer,negative
apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers,negative
in scream it was a ghost mask scary enough in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher mans rain slicker in the middle of summer no less and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ooh scary intended to conceal identity,negative
for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume,negative
though i must admit urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film,negative
the films killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends you know like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that theyre coming from inside the house,negative
i wont spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used after all the film does offer fine 2 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough,negative
sad to say it doesnt include my favorite urban legend a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil,negative
now that would be scary,negative
before i leave you i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film the first being the lack of craft the second the lack of exploitation its characters all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people ive ever spent an evening with,negative
only jared leto looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day and alicia witt as the resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness,negative
the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum as a supremely irritating lout so irritating i actually cheered his painful death and i am not a cruel person,negative
ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining,negative
after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i cant stand getting slaughtered which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i cant stand not getting slaughtered,negative
the spy game is up,negative
you can thank charlies angels the movie for that,negative
when did banality and pandering become okay,negative
just steal from hong kong the matrix and a kitschy tv show from the mid1970s and thats a movie,negative
charlies angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film ive seen in ages,negative
charlies angels is dumb,negative
just plain dumb,negative
as we all know three of the hottest females on the planet drew barrymore cameron diaz and lucy liu are three superagents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie,negative
they all drive fast cars look ohsofabulous even in the morning and dont seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men having buildings explode ten feet in front of them or flying through the air in matrix slowmotion,negative
and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavagebusting wetsuits cleavagebusting waitress uniforms and cleavagebusting wet tshirts they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying drunk sorority girls the kind who hit on everybody at a party,negative
the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer the great sam rockwell who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company,negative
of course the rival wants control of his new personal identification system which involves such latterday buzzwords as gps cellular tracking and even mainframe,negative
the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels like battling each of them in many roundrobin matrix ripoff again fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to slicedoff locks of the angels hair,negative
the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley serving as charlies manservant or more to the point the angels pimp,negative
the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables carboncopy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourkes longlost brother,negative
charlies angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight,negative
nothing is difficult plausible or believable in any of the angels actions,negative
it feels like the matrix mission impossible 2 and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one,negative
diaz is a knucklehead,negative
barrymore is the dangerous one mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role,negative
liu is just,negative
lucy liu looking good in a skintight black leather suit,negative
the list of movies from which charlies angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing,negative
the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon lethal weapon ii all of jackie chans movies the great escape saturday night fever revenge of the nerds payback darkman dr no the matrix as mentioned and even tvs friends,negative
its a shame too because one of the many screenwriters john august was at the helm of last years favorite go,negative
then again what can you expect from a director known solely as mcg,negative
there is no camp value in the film no interesting main characters no invigorating action scenes no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players,negative
note to hollywood next time lets leave the tv shows on the tv,negative
late in down to you the lead female character julia stiles states her greatest fear is having an artificial conversation with her boyfriend freddie prinze jr,negative
the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out fallen asleep or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy,negative
the film is a multimillion dollar testament to everything artificial,negative
filled with characters motivation plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster,negative
prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles freshman coed,negative
at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of outdoing the previous in how cute it can be,negative
the happy couple psychoanalyze each other they pick out a song because as prinzes dj mother lucie arnez explains every couple needs a song he smells her shampoo she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love,negative
then in standard romantic comedy style things fall apart,negative
why,negative
well because they have to,negative
otherwise the couple cant make up and live presumably happily ever after,negative
down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic,negative
scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead,negative
a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together or even knowing each other but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat,negative
the supporting characters are remarkably flat and insultingly ridiculous as well,negative
stiles best friend rosario dawson is a pot head prinzes roommate shawn hatosy is a girl crazy fool who cant meet women and then there are the porn stars zak orth and selma blair,negative
he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television does the college lecture circuit and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film,negative
you know the average porn star,negative
the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime hes on screen the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes,negative
she is a porn star mostly so we know shes slutty so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted,negative
attempts at drama which means julia is going to cry include a pregnancy scare and the big break up,negative
these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes,negative
what happened here,negative
the cast is full of likable promising young actors stiles especially seems to be going places,negative
kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off,negative
in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last years extremely unpleasant the story of us for teen audiences,negative
the direction is filmschoolgrad obvious,negative
its stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen a pointless parody of cops characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion,negative
plus the whole story is told flashback style narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera,negative
this is the second film in a row following wing commander starring freddie prinze jr which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of shes all that,negative
if he doesnt start making better choices fast his future films wont be so lucky,negative
im not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing disturbing behavior with scream,negative
maybe its because theyre both horror films kinda both have hot young stars both have an annoying alternative soundtrack and both are aimed at the teenage crowd which i guess includes me,negative
but this is not the next in line with the scream flicks as well as the i know what you did last summer soon to be flicks,negative
it owes less to halloween and more to kafka and orwell which in my book makes for a more interesting feature,negative
and it should have been,negative
this is basically a rehash of the stepford wives the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing as ive been told with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives,negative
or something like that,negative
behavior starring katie holmes of dawsons creek deals with a bunch of teenagers deep in angst who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers,negative
suckups,negative
preppies,negative
it actually at least to me sounds like it would work and with scott rosenberg that witty penmen who has written stuff like beautiful girls and things to do in denver when youre dead as well as con air it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit,negative
alas its not and it plumets into that little group of movies known as the movies with potential that blow it,negative
i remember a film called white mans burden which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with its potentially brilliant premise,negative
heres another one,negative
it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves,negative
its a stage and this film does in fact realize that,negative
it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly,negative
now it just needs to work as a film,negative
which it doesnt,negative
its too sloppy and too contrived,negative
it paints a bleak portrait of high school life then,negative
lets it lie,negative
it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kissups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes then,negative
gives it a cheap twist when they get horny they become homicidal,negative
isnt it scary enough that theyre like this and cant the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them not that you could be next to die,negative
the film introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because theyre not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull whos having trouble at home because he hasnt gotten over his brothers ethan embry in quick flashes so you dont recognize him i did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawsons creek whos chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without a face whos the most interesting because hes the only character whos given some dimension,negative
in the films best scene he introduces steve to every single clique nailing each ones fetishes and hangups and its the best scene in the movie because its witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this film isnt,negative
gavin suspects theres something awry with the preppie kids known as the blue ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve hes only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff,negative
here we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor,negative
the only other halfinteresting character is the school janitor played by william sadler as a retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but,negative
really we dont care anyway,negative
i probably shouldnt mention that this was directed by david nutter whos works for the xfiles because that would probably tarnish his reputation,negative
like the show hes good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating a general creepy feel,negative
most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works,negative
but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff,negative
he keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just dont get the hell out of there,negative
i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that theres something rotten in the state of teen angstdom,negative
what this film needs to be is a lot longer a lot more colorful and a lot creepier,negative
if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor played by bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed then they need to come up with a tougher smarter villain,negative
if hes so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who couldnt figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes,negative
the film which runs about 80 or so minutes just needs to work on these things and become a lot less sloppy,negative
at such a short running time and with such lame boring characters as these its pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in ones mouth especially mine,negative
one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris odonnell stars in this remake of buster keatons 1925 silent film seven chances,negative
now ive never seen seven chances as im more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this,negative
odonnell plays jimmie shannon the manager of a pool table manufacturing company,negative
he also fears commitment and despite dating anne renee zellweger for over three years hes unwilling to marry her,negative
his reasons,negative
well hes a guy you see and well guys are like stallions and they apparently dont like to be roped or something hey thats the movies explanation,negative
id marry renee zellweger in a second,negative
eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose and when he does its the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever,negative
he essentially says to her you win and hands her a ring,negative
the audience should now hate this character,negative
i did,negative
then the meat of the plot presents itself,negative
jimmies grandfather peter ustinov completely wasted dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business,negative
however in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers jimmie must be married before his next birthday which is just over 24 hours away,negative
having blown his chances with anne jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a business proposition,negative
the movie wasnt half bad by this time surprisingly,negative
it wasnt boring me and even managed to read my thoughts at one point,negative
ustinovs character left a video will and while hes reading the ridiculous clause in it i thought to myself what is this brewsters millions,negative
as soon as i thought it hal holbrooks character actually says what is this brewsters millions,negative
it was quite surreal,negative
something happens though during the films final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive,negative
up to that point all of jimmies prior girlfriends had turned down his business proposition which i felt was good,negative
at least the film wasnt painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers,negative
when jimmie has no other options his goofy friend played by artie lange making a career out of playing the goofy friend places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story,negative
at this point 100 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride,negative
these women arrive at jimmies location and immediately start bullying him about what hes looking for in a woman,negative
when hes had enough of their unjustified attacks he tells the angry mob that theres been a mistake and he wont be marrying any of them,negative
as a result the women proceed to chase him around the city in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off,negative
this goes on for the rest of the film,negative
its just chris odonnell running from 100 000 obnoxious greedy angry and stupid women,negative
my groans of disgust could be heard for miles,negative
the film finally ended thankfully but to this day im still groaning,negative
the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video,negative
it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 cast and crew info and special dvdrom features,negative
the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc which contains scenes not in the film,negative
apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing odonnell around the city and at one point odonnell is leaping from the tops of buses,negative
so that was bad enough to be cut but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good,negative
ugh,negative
there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it,negative
then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes,negative
writerdirector john herzfelds two days in the valley falls into the latter category,negative
weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters herzfelds tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories,negative
hitmen lee james spader and his partner dosmo danny aiello pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox teri hatcher lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked,negative
an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops jeff daniels and wes eric stoltz,negative
a murder is not vice territory flirting with asian prostitues is but wes would rather play inquisitive detective,negative
meanwhile washedup director teddy paul mazursky is about to end his life,negative
but before he can do that he must find a good home for his dog,negative
enter nurse audrey marsha mason who takes the dog and teddy for a ride,negative
stuffy art dealer allan hopper greg cruttwell has kidney stones,negative
while struggling about his fancy house he switches between moaning in selfpity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretarys glenne headly plain appearance,negative
dont be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on,negative
you might like that feeling of cluelessness,negative
herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes,negative
the jigsaw puzzle assembled isnt stunning by any means though,negative
the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altmans reallife heroes in short cuts even though they are interesting and funny,negative
funny that is if you arent comparing them to the likes of tarantinos pulp chcaracters,negative
the tieup is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of directors name,negative
guy who also did last seduction red rock west,negative
two days isnt a bad movie but there isnt much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters,negative
itll keep you guessing alright but you wont remember the answers five minutes after the credits,negative
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids,negative
it seems that a woman has also been kidnappedshe is the sister of one of them e t s,negative
henry thomas and the girlfriend of another flannery and the asking price is 2 million which said snots are unable to cough up alone,negative
they even cut off walkens finger to show they mean business because they are desperate to save the womans life,negative
suicide kings is a terrible film,negative
walken aside there isnt a single appealing cast member,negative
ofallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance,negative
in an amusingly unironic scene walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a teeits as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director,negative
the plot is another issue entirely,negative
ofallon is someone whom im betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster which is entirely unrelated to both the story and learys character or the numerous anecdotal sequences but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses,negative
by the fourth big i had completely tuned out wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material,negative
recently a peer a fellow young filmmaker informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys the mob and the fbi,negative
it occurred to me then whats wrong with indies like suicide kings i suspect ofallon has never met a mobster is not a rich man doesnt deliver endless clever monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots,negative
in short these guys are just riffing on other movies and in doing that making the same film over and over and over again,negative
tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantinos niche instead of carving their own,negative
reviewed at the toronto international film festival,negative
seen december 2 1997 at 6 50 p m at the glenwood movieplex cinemas oneida ny theater 3 by myself for free free pass,negative
theater rating good seats sound and picture,negative
there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons,negative
they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation,negative
watching flubber really clinched this idea for me because its just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy,negative
it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality and how important it is to actually have a story,negative
the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted cartoony atmosphere,negative
we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard williams the typical supposedly likable mad scientist,negative
within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is,negative
phillips memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemers disease isnt this rather lowbrow comedy,negative
he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class an inappropriate joke for a kids movie if i ever saw one,negative
we learn he has stood his up fiancee sara harden twice at the altar simply because hes forgotten,negative
sara claims to love him but says if he forgets the wedding again shell stop loving him a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has,negative
but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve and its no surprise the major conflicts here are related,negative
christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft a scientist who not only wants to steal phillips ideas but his woman too,negative
whats worse is that sara actually seems interested in him,negative
wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield which is going broke unless phillip can invent something to save the day,negative
one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film,negative
the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced but is all but forgotten about thereafter,negative
its obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny,negative
unfortunately the flubber like all the special effects in this film looks very fake and unconvincing,negative
flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality and by the time it performs a song and dance routine you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object,negative
most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy since phillips absentmindedness is forgotten about and somehow push the story along,negative
but its clear how weak this premise is from the getgo and the film just gets worse,negative
all the jokes involve people getting hit by fastmoving flubberpowered objects including bowling balls flying cars that dont fly well and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air,negative
its all presented with complete logic and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes,negative
during the basketball scene the coach for the rival team actually says i think they might be cheating to which the referee replies theres no rules about jumping too high,negative
predictable doesnt begin to describe the motions the film goes through especially after the halfway point,negative
and its not how terribly contrived the plot is its the way its broken down scenebyscene with absolutely no transition,negative
not only that but all the actors here especially williams seem bored to tears,negative
id say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen so its almost forgivable when you realize theyre talking to nothing and interacting with nothing,negative
its safe to say everything that could be bad about flubber is,negative
the only original element the film has is the worlds first romance between a machine and a human,negative
but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it and like the rest of the film you wont,negative
overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name based on shirley jacksons novel the haunting of hill house stars lili taylor as one of three lab rats that participate in a supposed insomnia study being initiated by liam neeson,negative
he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it,negative
he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of creepy cgi effects scare the cast and try the audiences patience,negative
i know this question has been posed before but why do people keep remaking good movies,negative
the original was a great psychological horror film,negative
this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary,negative
in fact i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg13 horror movie that is scary,negative
unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening then theres nothing in this film that will raise hackles,negative
i nearly fell asleep twice during the film and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didnt seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed,negative
its sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly,negative
owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability,negative
catherine zetajones always nice to look at is given the woefully underwritten role of a bisexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs,negative
liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about whats going on as the rest of them do,negative
finally poor lili taylor the center of the film gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her,negative
apparently a subplot involving a tryst between zetajones and taylors characters was filmed but removed,negative
thats too bad because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative,negative
this is jan de bonts second straight misfire speed 2 cruise control being the first,negative
when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better,negative
robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that,negative
one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset,negative
if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything it would have served to make the film terrifying,negative
what our mind fashions on its own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything,negative
apparently yet another version of this story is being filmed under its original title,negative
i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bonts version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had,negative
pg13,negative
while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation we had yet another shoddy subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks,negative
and once again we have one of the worst films of the year,negative
the trend of the moment and bear in mind its a trend not a movie is spawn and if youve seen the animated series on hbo youll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment hes been sent to hell,negative
todd mcfarlane the creator of the spawn comic book must have had a tough time sitting through spawn for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects style over substance ambience over anything else,negative
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects the story about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of bad guys and find himself in the process is realized in such a sordid incapable manner it becomes indigestible after a while,negative
every character in this film is lifeless vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student,negative
the story begins like in every superhero movie in this age with a man living an idyllic life,negative
al simmons michael jai white a government shares the love of his wife wanda theresa russell and daughter has a tongueincheek wiseass partner terry d b sweeney and is content with the job his boss jason wynn martin sheen provides him,negative
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry,negative
and as expected everyone turns the tables on poor al,negative
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant al is befriended by jason and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene,negative
inevitably it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away,negative
hence jasons mischievous mastermind plan to conquer the world is just commencing its initial stages when al makes a pact with satan himself agreeing to command the devils army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again,negative
so our pal al has been uplifted to hell and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place his ol partner terry forms a relationship with his wife,negative
time passes,negative
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city the ghetto where cog nicol williamson teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts his motorbike armor etc,negative
this character is merely a poor mans obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla,negative
now the stage is set spawn the new enemy of evil vs evil,negative
and evil takes the cake doubtlessly,negative
john leguizamos deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the films relief point,negative
all this anguish pain halfbaked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo who steals the show and derives joy from his character which is basically a compilation of soso one liners,negative
and then theres martin sheen,negative
whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years,negative
his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent,negative
as the megalomaniac boss his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a bmovie scrambled and left in the shelf to rot,negative
this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street,negative
id never thought id be saying this but at this juncture charlie sheens career is in better shape,negative
spawn is a movie in which realism or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable,negative
for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling jumping through roofs and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better,negative
it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie a very bad superhero movie,negative
continually the film kept on depending on special effects and sadly this is how pictures are being made,negative
perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry,negative
the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible,negative
the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting,negative
it is perceptible that director mark dippe attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burtons batman did touch the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act,negative
but bruce wayne had human elements to him,negative
he was pensive resourceful and had relationships which made our perspective on him equally human,negative
the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change as if hes fatigued about being normal,negative
and as all superheroes batman superman the phantom they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary,negative
none of this is present in spawn,negative
the fighting sequences are weakly executed the dialogue is pennydreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runners,negative
as an example of this films vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten and then rescued by spawn so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic,negative
admittedly i did laugh once in the film and thats when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum,negative
it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature,negative
besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn,negative
movies that present no admiration no captivation no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to,negative
and kids will continue to see films like spawn simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one,negative
children are not muppets,negative
and spawn unapologetically targets children,negative
plot a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth oops i,negative
mean an evil man,negative
he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself,negative
anyway fourteen years go by and arrgh well you know the rest swishswishzzzzzzz,negative
critique this is a pretty bad movie,negative
lets see where should i start,negative
okay first of all the story is just plain boring,negative
its not original is entirely predictable and lacks energy,negative
okay whats next,negative
acting you say,negative
hmmmm well the main actor justin chambers is basically an uncharismatic version of chris odonnell but with less range think about that and mena suvari is just plain off,negative
not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons dragons but entirely miscast with bad deliveries awful sequences and a pisspoor accent that comes and goes,negative
now im not sure if this was ms suvaris fault or the directors but ive definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film,negative
the only semisaving grace actorwise is tim roth as the irrepressible bad guy but once again its not something that we havent seen before a,negative
thousand times by the same guy,negative
tim please for the love of god beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day american roles for you as a nice guy in a romantic comedy or something,negative
stretch dude stretch,negative
we all know that you can do much better than this gunk,negative
alright what else was bad in this film,negative
oh yeah the score,negative
yikes hows about taking it down a few notches there fellas,negative
this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene but actually does little more than annoy,negative
i think its important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isnt a real epic by any stretch of the imagination,negative
its a fluffy rehashed cakewalk created by some shrewd studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole kungfu phenomenon in films and test it out on an old classic,negative
dudes you,negative
failed all around,negative
keep reading,negative
the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems plentiful,negative
why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top,negative
why dont they just cut the mouseketeers rope at the top of the tower instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging,negative
why doesnt anybody look a day older when the sequence says 14 years later,negative
at least change,negative
your shirt man,negative
keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a fun time but this flick just didnt cut it for me,negative
it was boring for stretches the acting was atrocious at times the romantic scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat,negative
i will give the movie this much and that is that its main reason for being its raisondetre as the french would say its fight sequences do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film,negative
i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer but what you see there are essentially the snippets from the two major and cool swashbuckling sequences from the film,negative
the first comes right at the beginning of the movie while the other essentially finishes the film off hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders,negative
the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap,negative
and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this films credits,negative
hullo,negative
the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers,negative
deneuve is barely in this movie,negative
ugh just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash,negative
now say it together gang all for one and one for all we,negative
vow to stay away from it all,negative
thank me later,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
a knights tale 710 american outlaws 510 crouching tiger hidden dragon 710 the matrix 810 the replacement killers 610 romeo must die 310 shanghai noon 610,negative
coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers relentless 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz played by character actor leo rossi spawned three more sequels,negative
relentless 3 third in the row features sam dietz again but this time detective who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case doesnt want to deal with similar line of work,negative
divorced demoralised and transferred he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer and evidence indicate connection with one of dietzs old cases,negative
to make things even more interesting it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation,negative
fans of the british tv films and miniseries like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies,negative
they both feature vicious psychopathic killers yet also give a lot of usually depressive details about chief investigators private lives,negative
this one isnt an exception but similarities with british television are only in content,negative
the execution and style is different which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best,negative
useless gratuitous erotica also doesnt help either obviously making this film longer than it should be,negative
the actors are good though leo rossi is fine as usual and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career,negative
signy coleman as dietzs love interest is on the other hand quite miscast,negative
but she wont have to worry about it in the future career since relentless 3 wasnt supposed to be anybodys finest moment anyway,negative
warning the following review contains spoilers,negative
cast gary sinise don cheadle connie nielsen jerry oconnell kim delaney tim robbins elise neal jill teed jody thompson bill timoney written by jim thomas john thomas and graham yost directed by brian depalma running time 115 minutes,negative
the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but,negative
gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife maggie kim delaney becomes ill and passes away,negative
don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot,negative
when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them neilsen and oconnell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining,negative
what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected,negative
before i ever saw the film i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr pepper,negative
every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it,negative
little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products,negative
dr pepper saves the day at one point and a dream features jerry oconnell shoving mms in our face,negative
these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film,negative
clich s are also the order of the day with mission to mars,negative
dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style even independence day which lifted all of its premises from other scifi films was better than this film and i dont like independence day,negative
films like 2001 a space odyssey the abyss and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from and poorly at that,negative
there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon and i couldnt help but whisper utinni to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it,negative
this film also features one of my alltime least favorite movie clich s the he would have wanted you to have this moment where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on,negative
scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films but in a film as clich ridden as this it is particularly irritating,negative
ennio morricones music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on but here it is dreadfully overbearing,negative
his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes,negative
at other times his music is unbearably overdramatic,negative
one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue wont reach its intended target,negative
mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme,negative
events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience,negative
we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest,negative
what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins character needs to turn himself into a popsicle except to invoke an emotional response i could think of at least one way to save him and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be smarter than i am,negative
during the finale when we are finally introduced to the translucent conehead kittyfaced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn,negative
a brief history lesson about where we came from is proffered then sinise is whisked away to be with the rest of our people he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that this is a chance to step foot where no one else has,negative
from the press ive been seeing this film receive it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater,negative
im sure the first weekend or two will be huge but once word gets out people will stop going,negative
lets just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isnt hurt by the negativity this film is generating,negative
id venture to say it wont be worse than this waste of time,negative
pg,negative
georges polti once wrote a paper called the thirtysix dramatic situations in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirtysix different situations,negative
this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes theres nothing new under the sun,negative
the faculty the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion,negative
theres not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing,negative
drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers screenwriter kevin williamson of scream 2 credit gives us a horror tale set in middle america ohio one eventful fall,negative
making use of a cast of unusually stock characters williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence daystyle but rather through the back door,negative
parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a rundown high school and soon have infested most of the student body leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day,negative
the lack of gusto is the movies major stumbling block,negative
even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this theyve been saved by an energetic approach,negative
this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamsons ability who enjoyed success with the wes cravendirected scream but couldnt pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer,negative
although he designs the faculty with more of a scifi bent than his typical slasher picture it still comes down to the same results throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive,negative
on that level the main roles are played by virtual unknowns,negative
only the recognizeable elijah wood deep impact is at the front other than that the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers,negative
perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these upandcomers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved but to do that theyd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la dawsons creek,negative
needless to say the acting is far from top notch nor does necessity ask that it should be,negative
there is a moment or two of genuine horror but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the scifi direction to make any use of it,negative
in sum the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off,negative
isnt it the ultimate sign of a movies cinematic ineptitude when you cant think of much to say about it other than it sucks,negative
one of the first official year 2000 releases supernova is such a movie,negative
i cant seem to get past oneword adjectives with this one although boring stupid and absurd doesnt amount to much of a review,negative
a shame,negative
i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate,negative
but cest la vie,negative
here goes nothing,negative
ill keep it short,negative
i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill 48 hours removed his name from the movie requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee,negative
the films fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press an event usually signifying a studios lack of confidence in a particular movie,negative
hills and mgms actions were prudent,negative
when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer for some reason james spader is forced to take command,negative
the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and on arrival picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony,negative
one of the crew members angela bassett knows this passenger who is played by peter facinelli and has some bad feelings about it and we all know what that means,negative
this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it,negative
another one of the crew members experiences this first hand after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo he does some impressive handstand pushups,negative
evidently touching this enigmatic eggshaped thingie makes you younger and stronger,negative
how,negative
why,negative
the movie never bothers to explain,negative
soon enough though spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad being chased by the allofasuddensuperhuman facinelli,negative
to be honest i dont even remember exactly why,negative
i just remember that i didnt care,negative
supernovas plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing,negative
in fact everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set,negative
well the effects are good though theres hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so im not sure whether thats so remarkable an accomplishment,negative
the performances are hardly worth talking about,negative
im not even sure i can call whats here performances though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger,negative
james spader is not a bad actor but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars ive seen in a while mostly because he isnt given a character with a personality,negative
the action scenes are just as bland since theyre pretty much just rehashes of action elements that werent particularly entertaining the first time around,negative
and since the action scenes are everything to this movie its pretty much dead in the water,negative
and for the life of me i cant figure out why its called supernova,negative
i have never been so confused after watching a movie,negative
meet joe black is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with a cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us,negative
at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season,negative
at first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score,negative
then youll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you finally understand whats going on youll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this,negative
the script is simply a silly and unresolved story which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture,negative
it feels like an eternity,negative
most of the time it is a pompous soap opera filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and meaningful winks,negative
the film is based on alberto caesellas play death takes a holiday,negative
the story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying yes,negative
soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death,negative
it is bills time,negative
but death has other plans,negative
it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive,negative
our bill is chosen to be deaths guide and in exchange he gets time,negative
bill introduces death as joe black who immediately becomes the center of everyones attention,negative
bills business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bills side lives in his house and resides at his office,negative
that is not all however,negative
bills youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her,negative
this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences,negative
it wouldnt be fair to say that this film didnt have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited to join bills family for dinner,negative
when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different,negative
it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure,negative
its one thing to say wouldnt it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth,negative
to create a motion picture out of this is another,negative
four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic,negative
it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film,negative
on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest scent of a woman,negative
hopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it,negative
his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment,negative
but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time,negative
how can you play death in human form,negative
to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters,negative
they are not creatures but phenomenas,negative
saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form,negative
handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work,negative
speaking in a calm soft voice portraying death as a lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters,negative
he looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than a demon or a redeyed executioner,negative
claire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits,negative
unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery,negative
in other words this is not what i expected from the director of scent of a woman,negative
it could and should be better with such cast and crew,negative
in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera,negative
how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres,negative
isnt there a law or something,negative
this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilbergs dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst,negative
mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flatout stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison,negative
writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill,negative
the plot for what its worth concerns two brothers nathan lane and an appalling lee evens who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father,negative
deciding to check out the longabandoned house they soon learn that its worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder,negative
but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse happy with his rundown little abode and wanting it to stay that way,negative
the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe,negative
whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue terrible overacting and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury signifying nothing,negative
the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is i hate that mouse,negative
oh cringe,negative
this is home alone all over again and ten times worse,negative
one touching scene early on is worth mentioning,negative
we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall,negative
he jumps into a tiny bed pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone,negative
its a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film,negative
a message to speilberg if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors,negative
this kind of rubbish will just not do at all,negative
take a look at the following equation,negative
a christmas carolghostbustersscrooged,negative
yes scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether,negative
scrooged is alternatively sick gross funny and then sickly soppy,negative
bill murray plays frank cross a t v executive with a horrible personality,negative
hes evil to secretary actors crew everyone except the t vs stations boss of course played by the late robert mitchum however he is then visited by a very dead exec who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts past present and future who is called the ghost of yet to come for some reason sure enough they arrive show cross how much of a s o b he is and he changes his way,negative
however throughout this simple plot weve got to suffer outlandish special effects poor comedy and an very very mean performance from bill murray,negative
frank cross isnt funny mean hes just mean,negative
he also isnt very good at emotional scenes and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is and how he has changed,negative
however the supporting cast are ok with good performances from mitchum allen who plays his girlfriend and john glover who plays crosss partner the ghost of christmas past isnt that bad either,negative
sadly though the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present played by carol kane,negative
whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny should be fired straight away,negative
and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 if i remeber correctly,negative
who thankfully dosent say much,negative
the script is horrendous,negative
michael odonaghue churns out terrible bad taste jokes which i guess is the whole point really then changes direction completely to emotional scenes,negative
and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes which are awful,negative
the special effects look nice but do nothing for the film,negative
theres some impressive make up effects also,negative
the music is also good which is scored by danny elfman,negative
but great effects and make up dont make a great film,negative
scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech,negative
why didnt cross just look out his exec window and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him,negative
overall then youd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided perhaps a plague,negative
adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy the wedding singer,negative
unfortunately that also has the effect of softening his edge,negative
hes nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore not that it was much of one,negative
hes certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot,negative
the year is 1985 letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia,negative
adam sandler is nice guy robbie the titular wedding singer who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits,negative
robbies life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee linda angela featherstone leaves him at the altar,negative
however things are looking up when he meets julia drew barrymore a waitress at the hall,negative
shes the perfect woman but for one small flaw shes engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king glenn matthew glave,negative
so most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love and his attempts to stop the wedding,negative
as far as plots go its a pretty thin and tired one,negative
to fill the gaps the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia,negative
from boy george to michael jackson from miami vice to dallas from the first cds to the last rubiks cubes this film revels in all the minutiae,negative
and then theres the music,negative
learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank and romy and micheles high school reunion this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow,negative
as a result most songs get maybe a lyric or a half but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives eyes the wedding singer vols,negative
2 3 and 4,negative
while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring at least they distract you from the plot,negative
at least last years my best friends wedding stirred up the standard keep your true love from marrying someone else plot by making the rival a nice person,negative
here glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him,negative
barrymore on the other hand is simply charming as julia,negative
which leaves us with adam sandler,negative
hes at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception,negative
when hes in full niceguy mode hes more pathetic than endearing,negative
the film boasts several cameos most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz,negative
but none of them work well at all,negative
buscemis role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous,negative
lovitz on the other hand as a rival wedding singer makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live where he was actually funny,negative
the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the films finale surprisingly one of the only plotrelated scenes which actually works,negative
adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man,negative
while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer the end result is no net gain,negative
and i thought stigmata would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year,negative
turns out i was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and selfimportant end of days is completely inept on all fronts,negative
its a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess,negative
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best its extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up,negative
for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesnt count is no fun at all,negative
end of days is a major stinker,negative
the movie opens in vatican city 1979,negative
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation,negative
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 1999 the world will be destroyed,negative
the pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought to be killed,negative
in new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy,negative
twenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal excop with a drinking problem,negative
now working as a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil,negative
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney,negative
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her,negative
there are so many problems with this film its hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept,negative
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with,negative
schwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea,negative
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions,negative
in other words trying to give him dimension was a mistake,negative
harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role theyve all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger,negative
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jerichos character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christines location by offering him his old life back,negative
none of these scenes really work because arnie isnt up to the task,negative
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before,negative
this one isnt at all believable the way arnold plays him,negative
the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all,negative
as the prince of darkness hes suave and confident,negative
he acts like one would expect the devil to act,negative
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as a powerful villain,negative
byrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil,negative
byrnes speech about the bible being overrated actually starts to make sense mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not,negative
variety are feeble at best,negative
the only problem is arnold has to win so in the end nobody really cares,negative
kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour,negative
robin tunney isnt given much to do except look scared,negative
in fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do,negative
performances aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it,negative
this being an action blockbuster its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is its utterly ridiculous,negative
why is the devil coming on new years eve 1999,negative
because its exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil which isnt 666 it turns out,negative
some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is 999 so just add a 1 to the beginning and youve got 1999,negative
if you dont buy this explanation youre not alone,negative
its convoluted and silly at the same time,negative
the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous shes christine see and she lives in new york see,negative
and if that werent bad enough theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all,negative
why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk excop hes powerless,negative
is he impervious to only one kind of bullet,negative
how come he cant control jericho or christine,negative
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies,negative
a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but its never actually explained,negative
usually this sort of thing wouldnt matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean dont get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting,negative
there are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of days complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there,negative
it gets so formulaic that its possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a boo will come,negative
their predictions will rarely be wrong,negative
the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we dont care about these characters due to the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too dont make any sense,negative
theres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady,negative
its good for a few chuckles but not much else,negative
supposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly,negative
none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that its often hard to tell why its happening in the first place not to mention that theyre edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style,negative
most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool,negative
end of days is not only silly and confusing but its also distinctly unpleasant to watch,negative
the devil apparently doesnt operate in the more subtle illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight,negative
this doesnt only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not a single scene in end of days goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head,negative
if violence is supposed to be shocking its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb,negative
scenes arent connected through any reasonable means so a lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why,negative
reasons,negative
to hell with reasons,negative
lets just blow stuff up,negative
isnt it cool,negative
nope not by a long shot,negative
this film is thoroughly unwatchable,negative
its dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity,negative
perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career because its not happening with hack peter hyams here,negative
end of days might have had camp value if only it didnt top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobodys going to buy,negative
if the movie is going to be serious the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script,negative
if its going to be campy arnold shouldnt be taking himself so damn seriously i didnt actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldnt be such a sad sack,negative
as it stands end of days is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that,negative
i can imagine how good krippendorfs tribe must have looked on paper,negative
it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director todd holland all wanted to make this film,negative
in fact it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorfs tribe as possible,negative
in retrospect i can imagine how bad this film could have been,negative
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss,negative
dreyfuss plays james krippendorf an anthropologist who is granted 100 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea,negative
halfway into his twoyear expedition his wife apparently dies,negative
i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established,negative
later we find out that much of the grant money was spent on bigscreen tvs and other such pleasures,negative
so when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely he decides to construct an elaborate lie,negative
he makes his own tribe using his three children as actors in a video,negative
he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe which he calls the shelmickedmu,negative
audiences at krippendorfs lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision,negative
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community,negative
like all films like this the lie becomes more and more complex and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero,negative
dreyfuss is a funny talented man and he is funny in this film,negative
he has lots of positive energy and unlike most comical actors really manages to play people like this realistically,negative
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that ive never seen dreyfuss perform and he does a great job,negative
jenna elfman who plays veronica mecilli a scientist who wants in on krippendorfs work is also very funny and appealing here,negative
and the kid actors are great as well,negative
but were talking about the script from hell,negative
this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen,negative
but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it,negative
all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew,negative
no the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and meanspirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched,negative
furthermore the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless,negative
take for instance the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex,negative
they get all decked out in the tribe getup complete with paint to darken their skin,negative
krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe,negative
now i saw this scene coming from a mile away but i said to myself no that would be far too tasteless,negative
theres no way theyll do that oh,negative
god,negative
they did do it,negative
its there,negative
i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didnt bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film,negative
i found it deplorable,negative
and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice,negative
the film is filled with scenes like these,negative
they not only insult the audience but they insult the types of people that the film portrays,negative
it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon,negative
and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining but i think that most members of the onscreen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes,negative
if i were an anthropologist this film would insult me immensely,negative
moving right along the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes,negative
sure dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny and it allows for some entertaining scenes but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes,negative
it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film,negative
his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does,negative
i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case but for the purposes of good taste i would have expected something,negative
no this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues and the writer of the film charlie peters didnt include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad,negative
in fact its his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing and he continually shrugs off her warnings,negative
i suppose its important to admit that this is a funny film,negative
dreyfuss and elfman and many of the contrived and insulting scenes add up to a picture that is anything but boring,negative
and if youre less serious than i you probably will enjoy it,negative
i however cant get past these elements,negative
krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldnt be learning,negative
with a little more insight into its story and themes this could have been a good movie,negative
fantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen,negative
the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on a boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about 17 years old doing some research in chernobyl,negative
some shady u s government guys appear and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like a giant lizard,negative
and whats more this beast is heading for new york,negative
gulp,negative
although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie,negative
the main faults lie with the acting and writing common problems with summer blockbuster movies,negative
broderick is pretty useless as the hero with no humour or a tough guy image,negative
while emmerichs previous summer flick independence day 1996 had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither,negative
also maria pitillo as brodericks former girlfriend is just as useless with a chronic disability in acting,negative
shes incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically shes total crap,negative
its up to french actor jean reno to save the day and indeed he does turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent,negative
shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film,negative
hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named animal and he adds a little life to the picture,negative
also making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as a slimy news reporter,negative
o k so the acting is not up to par but it never is in these movies,negative
but what about the script,negative
well thats not up to par either,negative
emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script,negative
the dialogue is banal broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters thats a lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant,negative
broderick forever remains a geeky scientist,negative
also the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour,negative
the jokes that are uttered are pathetic and theres an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert,negative
the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene,negative
ha ha ha ha,negative
the plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park 1993 by having lots of baby godzillas i e,negative
velicorapters running around new york,negative
right so the script and acting suck,negative
but what about the special effects,negative
thankfully theyre are quite good,negative
godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we dont see much of him because the movie is so dark,negative
the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell,negative
but although they are impressive they cant save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie,negative
the movie goes on for far too long aswell and it cant seem to decide on a ending,negative
and of course the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel,negative
lets just hope one never arrives,negative
bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment,negative
chris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point,negative
based on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult,negative
starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children,negative
soon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious,negative
andrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions,negative
it shows out that because of a small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained a soul,negative
this makes him unique and his evil creators worried,negative
then mr martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasnt programmed to do,negative
soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love,negative
this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction,negative
ever since that film the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy,negative
what makes us human,negative
the thoughts,negative
the emotions,negative
is it possible to become human,negative
at what point can we say to a robot now you are one of us,negative
these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach,negative
it is obvious that columbus didnt take them very seriously,negative
when you think about it this film is not really meditating on the question when is a robot no longer a machine but a human being but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding,negative
andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being and only the society has troubles with it,negative
in other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards,negative
further more there are other annoying problems,negative
to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now,negative
this has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task,negative
columbus is the first to have crossed that line,negative
the result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort,negative
the world is simply frozen in time,negative
neither the society fashion culture or values have changed over 200 years,negative
mom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes,negative
when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today youll see a slightly bigger difference,negative
i am not saying that everything should change,negative
it is unlikely that the human rights will change but its even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion,negative
i suppose its possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale but its really hard,negative
robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way,negative
as always he does a decent job as does sam neill,negative
but it doesnt really matter,negative
it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience,negative
pretty much like last years meet joe black this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesnt deserve,negative
great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten,negative
when isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical,negative
everything seemed possible,negative
now is the future of asimovs time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago,negative
for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius vernes 20 000 leagues under the sea so cant we accept this story as a potential reality,negative
let us hope that next years a i,negative
will be more rewarding,negative
disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life richard leonardo dicaprio sets off for thailand,negative
there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy robert carlyle who gives him a map to a beach a secret utopia then commits suicide,negative
richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel tienne guillaume canet and fran oise virginie ledoyen,negative
once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach there richard falls for fran oise,negative
this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element which is solely a creation of hollywood seems to hold to the original novel,negative
the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking,negative
i dont think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning,negative
but that is were many things go wrong darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography,negative
though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking,negative
the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts,negative
this is where the movie has some great potential then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better yes folks i said better,negative
now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise,negative
this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost unwatchable,negative
there is even a video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting it doesnt make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion and i am hoping many other peoples,negative
i am hoping that in my little rant ive made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing so if you go see it and you dont like it because of this dont blame me,negative
the character development was not up to par either i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child,negative
although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard leos character comes off as a wannabe philosopher,negative
the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason granted some people are like this myself included but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does,negative
the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough,negative
richard is obviously obsessed by fran oise at the early stages of the story yet there is actually very little development along this story line,negative
this i am sure contributes to the movies lack of core plot and being unfocused,negative
now i shall move onto something a little better about the movie for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it,negative
the cast and acting was passable at the very least and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard,negative
mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better,negative
which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much,negative
i think this is a topic all on its own so i wont get into it,negative
but i like the fact that there was an international cast used had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible,negative
the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable,negative
not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense,negative
when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable,negative
i would not recommend this movie to anyone the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story,negative
as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt,negative
if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings,negative
if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film it was studio 54 the late steve rubells infamous new york discotheque which came to symbolize the taboosmashing excesses of the disco eras heyday easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone all set to a thumping dance beat,negative
so when miramax started production on 54 last year the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began an edgy film as downanddirty as the club itself written and directed by a promising firsttimer mark christopher and starring some hot young talent salma hayek neve campbell newcomer ryan phillippe and mike myers in his dramatic debut,negative
my how easily does the worm turn,negative
hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11thhour reshoots wrapped only a month ago a rash of studioimposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew especially christopher unhappy and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics,negative
at the last minute though miramax did decide to screen the film so hastily scheduled was the screening that myerss last name was misspelled on the invitation not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed myself included,negative
and with good reasonsomehow some way the supremely disappointing 54 has made the historically hip haven of hedonism,negative
boring,negative
although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film he still must shoulder some of the blame for 54s lifelessness,negative
54 focuses for the most part on a tightknit trio of employees at the club coat check disco diva anita a wasted hayek her busboy husband greg breckin meyer and most prominently the freshfromjersey shane oshea phillippe who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender,negative
these characters are about as generic as those descriptions,negative
in focusing on the hired help christopher really missed the boat,negative
with the exception of the flamboyant alwayswoozy rubell myers in a wellmodulated turn the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers but those of the people who went there to party not necessarily the numerous vip guests but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the clubs famously hardass doormen and dance among other things the night away with the rich famous and infamous the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dows feisty dottie a disco and drugcrazed granny but shes a peripheral character at best,negative
as such aside from the expected overhead crowd shots there is precious little actual dancing in 54,negative
what is a disco filmespecially one about the pinnacle of the movementwithout the dancing,negative
even whit stillmans thelastdaysofdisco which wasnt so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hiptoonlythemselves clubhopping preppies featured at least one extended dance scene,negative
dancing isnt the only thing glazed over in 54so is the sex but that may not be entirely christophers fault,negative
from what ive heard his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring starting with the shane character he was conceived and actually filmed as a wild morally ambiguous bisexual which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54s legend,negative
but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out consequently so was the film,negative
aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film shanes fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie sela ward and an abbreviated bedhopping montage the sexual dimension is just about ignored,negative
shane in this incarnation is sanitized to the point of blandness an idealistic dogooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club julie black campbell a worldly soap star with yes a heart of gold,negative
this tackedon romance would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience,negative
they fail on both counts,negative
ultimately 54s failure comes down to three letters fun,negative
as in there isnt any to be had for the audience,negative
too much time is spent with the boring shane and too little is spent on the club floor where all the action took place,negative
anyhow though whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively,negative
when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club it should be a euphoric height for her the crowd and the audience however the moment doesnt get a chance to reach that level for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality which also mars the films conclusion one of the lastminute reshoots,negative
strangely upbeat and wistful the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying,negative
there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out theretwo of them in factbut 54 is not one of them,negative
theyre on cable tv a couple of documentaries produced by e and vh1,negative
these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goingson within it show that theres still a great disco movie to be made,negative
the problem is after the critical and certain box office failure of 54 the subject may have run its hollywood course,negative
starring ben stiller elizabeth hurley maria bello janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz,negative
permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie though it took me a few days to conclude this,negative
the film is more masturbatory than bleak with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity,negative
he has a 6000 a week drug habit,negative
ultimately as adapted by veloz jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve you are less mystified by his selfdestructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself,negative
ben stiller plays stahl a young author who arrives in l a with ambition and a nasty drug habit,negative
he eventually gets a gig for 5000week writing for a sitcom called mr chompers a thinly veiled standin for alf chompers looks just like alf except hes blue marries a producer hurley so she can get a green card and hooks up with a spanish mother liz torres who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons,negative
insert proverbial downward spiral here,negative
permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback with recovering addict bello meeting stiller at a fastfood restaurant where stiller works the drivethru as part of rehab taking him back to a hotel and between bouts of serious screwing listening to his life story,negative
ive spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractiveworse ive been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive,negative
as stahl stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect posttheres something about mary of either the actor or a comedy writer,negative
what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punkjunkies it seems is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy,negative
watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby,negative
watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smackfueled babble,negative
stiller gives a technically flawless performance the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie,negative
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless,negative
when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved,negative
and then answers it in the form of bellos character basically a shrink in black panties could a person care less,negative
in the film version of his autobiography of the same name stahl doesnt need saving he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself,negative
if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie its that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywoodtypes known to man,negative
stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs,negative
is this hollywood california,negative
i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead,negative
of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems,negative
so basically his drug habit got him a book deal a movie based on his life and now hes apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects,negative
so much for the moral of that story,negative
temporary midnight is more like it,negative
bill chambers september 1998,negative
what would you do if no one could see you,negative
well if youre a super smart biomolecular research scientist working for the military youd grope a coworker and roughup your neighbor from across the street,negative
thats right,negative
of all the noncriminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible in hollow man kevin bacons character opts to commit sex crimes,negative
er its kevin bacon who plays the super smart military biomolecular research scientist,negative
something sounds horribly wrong already,negative
but this is a paul verhoeven film and the sleazepin director of such opencrotch classics as basic instinct and the infamous showgirls never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which when you come right down to it is all this film is about,negative
hollow man features a string of hapless clist actors among them bacon elisabeth shue josh brolin and kim dickens in a gradez plot with a lot of special effects that frankly dont look much better than those used in the 1933 version of the invisible man,negative
oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when hes attempting reentry but otherwise its lots of thermal shots and inanimate objects elisabeth shue included bobbing around without any visible signs of support,negative
since invisibility once achieved isnt much of an effect the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each otherit amounts to much of a muchness the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in looselybuttoned sweaters so that the minute bacons character gets invisible he can head straight for them,negative
its as if that fascinating conceptwhat would you do if no one could see you is,negative
simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin,negative
as a horror film hollow man is unsophisticated and disturbing in its intent not its achievements and not worth your time or your hardearned dollars,negative
its minor verhoevenand even thats not saying muchand boy is it hollow,negative
wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles,negative
murder at 1600 u s marshals money train drop zone boiling point and the ultimate camp film passenger 57,negative
the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category,negative
ultimately it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe and terrible acting by blist actors like michael biehn and anne archer,negative
oddly it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes masterpiece rising sun,negative
the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador the chinese triad brotherhood a rich chinese businessman played by that bad guy from rising sun caryhiroyuki tagawa a chinese un interpreter and inexplicably donald sutherland,negative
the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island,negative
or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woos hong kong films combined,negative
i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film,negative
i usually enjoy snipes movies though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films,negative
simply i am amazed by the how inane the script was filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences,negative
director christian duguay screamers has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts showing splattering brains people impaled with broken shards of glass and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere,negative
it also sickens me to know that oliver stone one of the greatest directors working today had his hand in producing this monstrosity,negative
i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script watch the dailies be involved in casting or anything else or else hed be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits,negative
its also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese,negative
im sure over the next couple of months even more chinese arts action flicks are going to be popping up in your local multiplex,negative
hopefully they wont include wesley snipes,negative
back in 1980s chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films,negative
he couldnt of course top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shootem up and beatem up genre aficionados,negative
that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group prolific production company that dominated the bmovie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap formulaic and more often than not unwatchable genre products,negative
the hitman 1991 action thriller directed by chucks brother aaron is one of the last among them,negative
chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed shot and left for dead by his partner which shouldnt surprise anyone considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks specialised for roles of usually very mean characters,negative
surviving the shooting cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent,negative
he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations italians french canadians and iranians,negative
since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris at least not in this kind of movie the biggest attraction of this film should have been action,negative
well the action in this film falls flat it is boring repetitive and not at all exciting,negative
it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films,negative
we know very little about norris character while on the other hand gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension,negative
in the end we almost feel sorry for them since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade,negative
during the film somebody obviously became aware of that problem so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris,negative
that caused another problem any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation,negative
the photography in this film is dark setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it,negative
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,negative
be forewarned,negative
its rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylors first feature film dream with the fishes when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup,negative
any hopeful expectations however are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatchedbuddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the films latter half,negative
the films central characters are terry david arquette a depressed lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill,negative
nick lives in the apartment building across from terry who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a halfdrunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide,negative
nick casually asks for terrys wristwatch and eventually cons terry into a trade the watch for a bottle of pills,negative
of course terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch,negative
learning of nicks condition he only has a handful of weeks left terrys compassion kicks in and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nicks lifelong fantasies and nick will fulfill terrys death wish by killing him,negative
this is a promising premise and mr taylors film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters terry is a repessed mournful character who wants to die while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits and where the straightlaced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character,negative
this is bythenumbers plotting buddy movie redux,negative
however dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline but by the characters which carry the story it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable,negative
unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits,negative
far from a romp this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond,negative
mr taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived witness such lines as you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain,negative
see thats provocative leaves room for further questions,negative
the film enjoys a few inspired moments the urn scene a session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes,negative
this occurs particularly often during the films opening sequence as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital im realising that this is intended to be funny although nary a smile crept upon my lips which is probably due to the obvious fact that its painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nicks scheme of tricking him this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes,negative
the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability,negative
among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering freshfaced characters he would have been terrific as the lead for george huangs swimming with sharks who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry,negative
mr taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated as opposed to a bright crisp look for the smalltown scenes,negative
the charge of dream with the fishess protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters and indeed in many cases have i been in the minority supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult audienceunfriendly nature of their characters,negative
for dream with the fishes though i did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die,negative
the thirteenth floor is a bland obligatory exercise in genre filmmaking,negative
if i hadnt recently watched the matrix and open your eyes both of which are similar but far superior i might have been a little nicer to this picture,negative
craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall the rich cocreator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss armin muellerstahl,negative
everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one and characters stare at each other for maddeninglylong periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level,negative
the acting is okay but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of and features a script copenned by director josef rusnak loaded with cliches and stock characters,negative
there are individual scenes and ideas that work i like the thought of a sentient computer program but none of the films strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree,negative
producer roland emmerich based on this and his previous directorial efforts seems hellbent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre sciencefiction,negative
walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century foxs anastasia,negative
but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about,negative
disneys recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and to a lesser extent hercules,negative
with anastasia fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window,negative
some may say so what,negative
its just a kids movie,negative
well,negative
if you have young kids beware as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpserotting rasputin zombie whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way,negative
consider yourselves warned,negative
nevertheless the animation is quite stunning at times,negative
don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout occasionally rivalling photographic quality,negative
and yet in other scenes the handdrawn material seems of the saturdaymorning tv crowd which leads me to wonder,negative
was this rushed to market to combat disney,negative
the plot as anyone who had read history before knows concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916,negative
not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened,negative
as for the plot go rent disneys candleshoe,negative
youll see 60 of anastasia there,negative
godzilla is a nuclear freak,negative
he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years and has become a new species one that has a foot as long as this bus and a claw as long as this sign,negative
this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific islands,negative
he tore up a ship that carried dozens of japanese men,negative
one survived,negative
only he was left to recount the terror that he had seen,negative
he was merely able to repeat the words godzilla godzilla godzilla,negative
the film then introduces us to matthew broderick a biologist who has been studying the fascinating growth of chernobyl earthworms,negative
theyre 17 larger than they used to be he proclaims,negative
the u s military pulls him off this three year project and assigns him to figure out what godzilla is,negative
and boy does he find out,negative
and boy does godzilla suck,negative
i hate to use such a word in a review something that is supposed to inform my audience but i really need to drive this one home and i refuse to use explitives,negative
it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movie saw the final cut and said ok,negative
its great,negative
lets show this puppy,negative
roland emmerich needs a good horse whipping,negative
his latest piece of trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece of modern american cinema,negative
and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films emmerich and his team of talentchallenged imbeciles would never have had a clue as to how the creature should look,negative
let me give you a few examples of this terrible attempt at filmmaking,negative
i plan on giving some things away here,negative
belive me godzilla holds no surprises for anyone with an iq higher than their shoe size so no,negative
worries,negative
however if you are looking for that first time thrill and you refuse to let me do you this favor by all means stop reading now,negative
a godzilla makes his first ever attack in the pacific islands,negative
he next strikes in new york city,negative
um anyone have a map handy,negative
b the mayor of new york city is a heavy set individual with parted gray hair and thick glasses,negative
his name is mayor ebert,negative
his assistant is named gene,negative
gene gives ebert a thumbs down at the end of the film,negative
i couldnt make this up if i tried folks,negative
c stay with me on this one,negative
ok,negative
godzilla can out run torpedoes,negative
hank azaria can out run godzilla babies,negative
which look more like jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors,negative
d the u s military upon realization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city decides that he might be hiding in a building,negative
e oh yeah i can go all the way to e godzilla strikes at manhattan,negative
manhattan an island approximately the size of san francisco holds three million people,negative
they evactuate to new jersey in about one day,negative
no problem,negative
f early on they bait godzilla with fish,negative
he likes fish you know,negative
the thing is on an island,negative
the atlantic ocean is three steps east but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fifth and 57th oh,negative
hes gonna come running,negative
g you know what,negative
ill stop with the list now the,negative
alphabet isnt big enough anyway,negative
the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year old do a rewrite,negative
the kid is good he must have said,negative
maria pitillo is looking to become a name in hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster,negative
bad move maria,negative
acting doesnt get much worse than her turn as brodericks exflame,negative
matthew broderick is a good actor but youd never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his youd seen,negative
jean reno needs to pick his american films a bit more carefully,negative
at times godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker abrahams zucker film,negative
airplane naked gun,negative
the jokes are indeed that bad,negative
but just when you think the filmmakers are having fun with you they take themselves seriously,negative
how dare they,negative
godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags and fart jokes,negative
at least then we would know we were supposed to laugh,negative
each and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid and i was really pulling for the beast to kill more of them,negative
emmerich did do one thing though,negative
and ive no idea if it was intentional,negative
he made me sympathize with godzilla,negative
his attackers were so damn dumb that i felt sorry for him being pelted with bullets and missles,negative
but what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his famous name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced,negative
warren beatty diane keaton goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsoms version of the classic romantic screwball comedy in town country,negative
the drawing room farce of the 30s dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action,negative
back then impossibly wealthy scions of society with too much free time would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers only to have everything come out all right in the end see the philadelphia story for a great farce,negative
town country has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work and sexual misconduct on several levels,negative
but there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is tcs downfall,negative
there is obviously a great deal of hollywood talent in front of and behind the camera involved in town country but without a likable or at least interesting story to carry through their efforts it is all for naught,negative
and thats what we get here naught,negative
porter stoddard beatty is a highpowered new york architect with a very good life indeed,negative
his 25year marriage to ellie diane keaton appears on the surface to be perfect,negative
but there are cracks just below this pristine surface,negative
his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts his kids dont need him and his best friends griffin garry shandling and mona goldie hawn are in the midst of a divorce,negative
porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late but like a man fighting against quicksand his struggle just sinks him deeper,negative
at the 90minute mark of town country i asked myself whats the point,negative
i wasnt entertained i laughed three times over silly little pratfalls and spent most of the film marking time til the end,negative
warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head,negative
keatons ellie is an empty headed flake who cant see the obvious as porter screws around on her,negative
and as you get to know them who would want friends like griffin and mona,negative
the supporting cast is given nothing to do and sometimes does harm to the film given the material they are forced to use,negative
nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling,negative
the actress who has eerily failed to age over the years is miscast as the airheaded musician and the character doesnt belong anyway,negative
jenna elfman is a sweet but smart ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures,negative
andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress is there any other kind in this movie,negative
who comes on to porter,negative
the saving grace is a pair of quirky perfs by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowells very strange parents,negative
glib rationalization of infidelity like if he doesnt speak english it doesnt count are a staple for the screenplay,negative
the morality of the film seems to be if you can get away with it go for it,negative
the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldnt want to know never mind befriend,negative
the actors do their best but are hamstrung by the weak material,negative
helmer chelsom who made the outstanding offbeat comedy funny bones is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on town country,negative
the production values are high as one expects from a big budget hollywood film,negative
but the opulent sets by caroline hanania lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and topnotch photography by william fraker cannot save town country,negative
the film has had a long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better for me anyway if hollywood just said no to this movie,negative
i give it a d,negative
the skulls is a laughably bad thriller a teenorientated doppelganger of the firm so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor,negative
certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter,negative
i chuckled incessantly all the way home,negative
let me share,negative
the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale designed im sure to mirror the actual skull bones from the same college,negative
luke mcnamara joshua jackson a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlights the latest skull scouting report,negative
despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization,negative
soon after he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women driving a new car and marveling at the 20 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account,negative
yeah dude pretty good deal eh,negative
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstances become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe as a drooling vegetable,negative
the premise although lacking in originality certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense,negative
unfortunately the skulls is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting,negative
its just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack the stars,negative
but not the script,negative
the skulls is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers,negative
first off upon their initiation into the skulls each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm,negative
afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar,negative
will they never take this watch off,negative
and what if they forget it by their bedside,negative
perhaps their secret society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed,negative
on top of this they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters,negative
gee why not member tshirts,negative
but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions,negative
they are given official skull paddles,negative
when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal,negative
facing the opposite way means a disagreement,negative
wouldnt they merely express themselves verbally,negative
hell no,negative
they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote and maybe afterward they can play pingpong,negative
im still chuckling about these ludicrous details but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest,negative
the cast meanwhile combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawsons creek crowd and fuses the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout,negative
but not entirely,negative
accomplished actors like craig t nelson as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson as fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricatures and look suitably embarrassed handling them,negative
and then theres christopher mcdonald who has the capacity to be a fun exciting actor,negative
mcdonalds charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue makes it a hattrick,negative
i pray it was a snatchthepaycheckandrun exercise for all these actors,negative
the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better,negative
lets cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character,negative
paul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blues is bland but passable as caleb mandrake the judges son,negative
walker preserves a straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad i just killed a guy in the ritual room,negative
some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who plays lukes longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics,negative
it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one,negative
or maybe not minute one thanks to a decent setup from director rob cohen who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style,negative
it makes you wonder why he didnt flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight arent superior cinema they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash,negative
aside from unintentionally humoring the audience the skulls gets little accomplished,negative
the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical,negative
the story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick,negative
instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage,negative
weve seen it all before and better,negative
the skulls is a feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve as a clever pun a term like boneheaded seems just too generous,negative
making your first feature film aint easy,negative
assemble a decent if not strong cast as robert moresco has done with one eyed king and youre already ahead of the game,negative
but rehash old plot lines tired dialogue and standard clich s and a wellintentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film,negative
how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse,negative
the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another but here we have it,negative
again,negative
five irish kids in nycs hells kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop,negative
with teary music,negative
and slow motion,negative
in the films first scene,negative
the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen,negative
leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a goodhearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante,negative
id like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah blah blah but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points,negative
hes concerned about buddy jason gedricks heroin abuse,negative
he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwins characters sister,negative
he looks into who might be pushing the most moroniclooking counterfeit cash ever made a genuinely funny touch,negative
but none of this ever really amounts to anything,negative
it seems that morescos greater concern is to provide that intangible slice of life that flavor of the neighborhood that everyones been trying to evoke since scorseses early work,negative
so we get the drunk guys hugging and singing together at the local bar to prove to us that they really love each other,negative
do people actually do this,negative
we get a lot of tough street talk usually mumbled for effect and a whole lot of the fword whether it sounds like it fits or not,negative
we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose,negative
bruno kirby chazz palminteri you know guys youve seen in movies just like this one before,negative
assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears and baldwins performance is adequate but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that its almost funny,negative
moresco a theater guy and sometimes tv writer including the series falcone obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child but the content is probably too personal,negative
as a result the movies style is heavyhanded in need of a considerable amount of toning down,negative
nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids moresco reminds us boy does he remind us,negative
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene running in slow motion complete with dialogue from the present just in case we dont comprehend the link to the past,negative
moresco needs to either trust his audiences intelligence or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it,negative
his next project should have a little more personal distance and a lot more subtlety,negative
if he actually gets that chance,negative
reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage feature story coming soon,negative
you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year,negative
theyre obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big boxoffice holiday season,negative
combine that with howie longs first starring action role and youve got a doozy of a movie that while not as bad as it could have been isnt a very good film,negative
howie stars as an ace smokejumper a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground,negative
in the slightly contrived opening scenes we witness his heroism in action as he and his mentor played by scott glenn attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire,negative
william forsythe plays the bad guy a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak,negative
he and five convict cohorts manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby,negative
his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards but since there must be a movie luck is with him,negative
soon the nowescaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters,negative
why canadian,negative
who knows eh,negative
along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher suzy amis to be their hostage,negative
enter howie long,negative
hes called in to help fight the blaze and when he spots the group of ground pounders apparently lost he parachutes in to help,negative
when he discovers their true identity he is the only thing standing between them and escape and the only hope of help for the hostage,negative
longs acting talents are above those of say steven seagal but not by much,negative
although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden hes a likeable hero and there are some hints here and there that he may get better,negative
the script doesnt help him out any however,negative
all too often it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny,negative
the dialogue is strictly bmovie material and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable,negative
longs costars are a mixed bag,negative
at least theyre all comfortable in their respective roles,negative
forsythe has the scenerychewing villain down cold down cold and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch even when he doesnt seem to be stretching his talents as is definitely the case here,negative
suzy amis plays peril pretty well but isnt given much more to do,negative
some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting but many are rather bland,negative
youd think that the director dean semler a former cinematographer would at least produce a film with interesting visuals,negative
thats not the case,negative
theres a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences weve,negative
seen this stuff before,negative
its not the most auspicious start to 1998 but it could have been worse just think back to 1996s debut biodome,negative
however after a month of oscarcaliber pictures a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were,negative
in fact theres a good chance that some of them are still playing near you,negative
weighed down by tired plot lines and spielbergs reliance on formulas saving private ryan is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches,negative
there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics,negative
spielbergs greatest strength as a director is the polished formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story,negative
but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war or the holocaust this technique backfires for it creates coherent comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken,negative
in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films,negative
saving private ryan tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a pr mission to pull a young man ryan whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere out of combat on the normandy front just after dday,negative
ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers,negative
the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france,negative
theres no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie,negative
the equipment uniforms and weapons are superbly done,negative
the opening sequence in which captain miller tom hanks leads his men onto omaha beach is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat,negative
another pleasing aspect of the film is spielbergs brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers the banality of death in combat the routine foulups in the execution of the war and the cynicism of the troops,negative
the technical side of the film is peerless as always,negative
the camera work is magnificent the pacing perfect the sets convincing the directing without flaw,negative
hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance which was utterly convincing and the supporting cast was excellent though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel,negative
yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events,negative
it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film or the story fails to convince,negative
throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices exception men are shown burning to death with relative frequency,negative
for example we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground,negative
here and there men lose limbs in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety theres an explosion and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man,negative
but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact,negative
there are no shoes with only feet in them no limbs scattered everywhere no torsos without limbs no charred corpses and most importantly all corpses have heads in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds,negative
the relentless dehumanization of the war in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity is softpedaled in the film,negative
ultimately saving private ryan bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war,negative
rather than saying saving private ryan is realistic it would be better to describe it as having realistic moments,negative
another aspect of the hollywoodization of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular the lack of swearing,negative
anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war such as fussells superb wartime understanding and behavior in the second world war which has an extensive discussion on swearing knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup,negative
who is this private ryan that we have to die for him,negative
asks one infantrymen in the group of eight,negative
rendered in wartime demotic that should have been expressed as who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him,negative
or some variant thereof,negative
conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the f word and largely about the search for food and sex,negative
this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an r rating due to violence so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film,negative
however the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic,negative
the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg,negative
he cannot just cede control to the material he has to be bigger than it,negative
as if afraid to let the viewer find their own perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear emotional foothold in the material spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary reminscent of the closing scene from schindlers list the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close every bit as bad as schindlers monologue about how his car tiepin or ring could have saved another jew quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson captain millers last words to private ryan and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain,negative
that particular subplot is so hokey so predictable it nigh on ruins the film,negative
nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage,negative
because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii saving private ryan can only pan for small truths in the shallows,negative
the scene at the end of 1989s dead poets society when robin williams english students stand up on their desk and say captain my captain gets me every time,negative
unfortunately the court room scene near the end of robins newest film patch adams doesnt have anywhere near the same impact,negative
from the surface patch adams looks very promising,negative
its a story about a not so young man patch adams robin williams who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people,negative
when the film opens we find patch depressed and suicidal checking himself into a mental hospital,negative
in a few scenes strongly reminiscent of one flew over the cuckoos nest he ends up helping the patients through their problems and its here that he finds how much he loves working with people,negative
so he checks himself out of the hospital and heads straight to medical school,negative
right from the start patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable,negative
he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry,negative
shortly after joining medical school he meets and falls in love with carin monica potter,negative
they along with patchs dork friend truman daniel london start a medical clinic for uninsured people,negative
once the dean catches wind of the clinic he tells patch he cant graduate and kicks him out of school,negative
patch like what any true american would do takes the school to court,negative
its here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place over whether or not patch can become a real doctor,negative
i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it,negative
it seems more like a series of short sketches rather than a fulllength movie,negative
considering it runs almost two hours much too long for such a light film it could have flowed much smoother,negative
not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama,negative
robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels,negative
but those moments are rare and in the end patch adams is barely average,negative
what are the warning signs of a terrible movie,negative
making its debut at the dollar theater,negative
locally chairman of the board did just that,negative
having the annoying prop comic scott thompson better known as carrot top in the lead role,negative
chairman of the board once again,negative
how about an overly exhausted paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence,negative
did somebody say chairman of the board,negative
thats right carrot tops long dreaded major motion picture debut at least for a starring role is poking up in a handful of theaters across the country,negative
chairman of the board stars the obnoxious wannabezany king of redheaded standup comics as a lazy but creative inventive but uneventful generation x er named edison,negative
living with a pair of surfer dudes in a small rented house edison bounces from job to job always squandering away the money on his eccentric to say the least inventions and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent,negative
this has the crabby landlady ms krubavitch estelle harris best known as george constanzas mother on seinfeld threatening an eviction if past due expenses arent furnished post haste,negative
as luck would have it edison soon meets armand mcmillan jack warden an old surfer dude who just so happens to be president of the multimillion dollar mcmillan industries,negative
sharing a passion for more than just riding waves armand is deeply impacted by the young inventors notebook of dreams and ideas and when the old man dies soon afterward edison learns he is named a benefactor in armands will,negative
predictably edison acquires the entire corporation and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowledge of the business world,negative
predictably there is a bitter nephew larry miller whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot,negative
predictably there is an attractive employee courtney thornesmith whose initial repulsion will transform into love for our doofy protagonist,negative
predictably the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds and give the company its most profitable and successful turnaround ever all because he ran things by common sense and not greed,negative
its as though writers turi meyer al septien and alex zamm meyer and septien also wrote leprechaun 2 together,negative
pulled a plot out of a hat and worked carrot top into it,negative
the jokes the surprises the developments all of them run such a predictable path it may only be carrot tops signature brazen red hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films,negative
a movie this bad speaks for itself,negative
whats left to say when every element the movie possesses is a shameful retread of movies past,negative
the script is 100 recycled the direction is hokey and the acting is absolutely horrible,negative
it is only thornesmith who seems to take her job seriously an accomplishment which surely deserves the medal of honor,negative
she certainly went beyond the call of duty she has to kiss carrot top,negative
barf bag please,negative
movies like this give the audience nothing to do but ponder just how many synonyms for bad there really are,negative
chairman of the board without a doubt deserves each and every one,negative
the only way this wont end up on everybodys bottom ten of the year list is if they were lucky enough never to have seen it,negative
just because you cant miss his outlandish fiery mane dont skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature,negative
spoiled rich kid kelley morse chris klein receives a new mercedes for a graduation present,negative
he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because hes rich and theyre not,negative
he ends up provoking jasper josh hartnett into a race and as a result the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it,negative
kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his familys barn,negative
jaspers girlfriend sam leelee sobieski soon takes a liking to kelley however despite the fact that 1 it was her familys diner that was destroyed and b all kelley does is sit around sulk and smart off to the townspeople,negative
but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless thats apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair,negative
so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people,negative
in the speech kelley quotes a poem by robert frost which just so happens to be sams favorite poem as well,negative
awwwww,negative
soon theyre frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town especially jaspers best friend see them together,negative
kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town especially when he shows up at the town dance drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper,negative
kelley runs off and decides to leave town,negative
sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him,negative
jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her and sam without even breaking stride basically says see ya,negative
and takes off to boston with kelley,negative
here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around its completely worthless,negative
chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers and its because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place,negative
however not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both,negative
i shouldnt have such feelings towards people i like but their characters are so infuriating that,negative
well trust me youll feel the same way,negative
even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two simply because his jerkish actions are calculated,negative
he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it,negative
jasper on the other hand only reacts to kelleys provocations and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions,negative
but as in life nice guys finish last,negative
for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the films only sympathetic character gets completely crushed,negative
then a cancer subplot comes into play where things get even more infuriating if you can imagine that,negative
what things werent depressing enough for you mr screenwriter,negative
who greenlit this project,negative
who on earth thought this would entertain anyone,negative
perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people,negative
but even after hes destroyed these peoples lives he continues to be a snob to them and ruins one more for good measure,negative
here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment,negative
it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions,negative
extras include jessica simpsons music video for where you are a commercial for the films soundtrack which by the way is the only good thing about the film the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots trailers for other fox releases anna and the king anywhere but here the beach drive me crazy ever after romeo juliet simply irresistible as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy,negative
the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine,negative
nothing that will challenge anyones systems of course,negative
fans of this movie if any exist should enjoy the dvd release,negative
here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling,negative
no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film,negative
it is merely a waste of time money and talent,negative
this is the movie that could singlehandedly bring mystery science theater 3000 out of cancellation,negative
its one of those movies thats so bad its absolutely hilarious due in no small part to its big star supermodel cindy crawford,negative
if you only remember one thing about fair game it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues,negative
if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l a youll change your mind when you see fair game,negative
ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition,negative
in a real casting coup crawford plays a superintelligent lawyer in a jogging bra of course,negative
we all know this is a stretch the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day,negative
nonetheless someone out there thought shed make a good lawyer but were reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes,negative
and for you horny teenage boys out there you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark,negative
come to think of it that may have been a body double,negative
cindy crawford isnt black is she,negative
like i said crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her,negative
billy baldwin or is it stephen,negative
alec,negative
adam,negative
kim basinger is the police detective who has to save her life time after time chase after chase explosion after explosion,negative
theres absolutely nothing original about this movie,negative
its every cop show of the 70s mixed with every action thriller of the 80s and every technology exploitation movie of the 90s,negative
three decades of crap all in one place driven further into the ground by crawfords complete lack of acting talent,negative
and its all completely predictable,negative
you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them you know when the sexual tension will finally end up in them consummating the relationship you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movies going to suck from the first scene,negative
the plot isnt really explained until the end,negative
all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer,negative
in the words of one of the villains we even know what size pantyhose she wears,negative
yeah you and every 14yearold boy in america,negative
he goes on to add we know more about her than she does,negative
that i find very easy to believe,negative
i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones if it werent for me youd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba,negative
because you see fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting but also some seriously bad dialogue,negative
it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasnt supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh,negative
one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief,negative
would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like im very interested in hardware and other crap about playing with his joystick,negative
i wouldnt but not because im a computer nerd,negative
its just not funny,negative
crawfords only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords body,negative
or was it jack lords body,negative
ill leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie,negative
the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft,negative
crawford says woodenly that was my clients boat you just blew up,negative
im filing a lawsuit against you,negative
youre in big trouble or something to that effect and baldwin replies smugly what do i have to do to get out of it,negative
they of course begin making out and the credits roll,negative
im not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how if theyd really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say you think i could settle out of court,negative
but i will tell you that if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her you quote the final line of the movie to that person what do i have to do to get out of it,negative
serving america for over 150th of a century,negative
i suppose its unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since its 1991 release,negative
michael lehmanns actioncomedy was quick to win the title biggest box office flop of all time or close thereof,negative
the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk whos just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation let me put it this way he explains i never saw et,negative
greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime played by danny aiello who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes,negative
these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences,negative
it appears as if director lehmann didnt know when to stop all the absurd silliness and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line,negative
if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldnt get goofier youll soon be eating your words,negative
but im inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as its box office numbers suggest,negative
its fastpaced and entertaining if youve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor,negative
for the first portion of this review im going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk,negative
wish me luck,negative
first and foremost bruce willis is a good sport,negative
while im not entirely sure what he was smoking when he cowrote this script willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big fat ugly joke,negative
he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and outofplace which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions,negative
another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character,negative
they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican and their relationship escalates in interest from there,negative
its unfortunate that mcdowells onenote character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plottwist and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis,negative
but now im rambling on again about the negative things arent i,negative
enough of the charade for the most part hudson hawk is an excruciating experience,negative
its stupid pointless and repetitive,negative
i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater because this film really doesnt have the potential to please anyone,negative
action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90 comedy and even the action sequences are skittery rushed and poorly edited,negative
and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headacheinducing hijinks,negative
dont get me wrong this film is not devoid of laughs,negative
its too bad most of them are unintentional or just plain forced,negative
the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed,negative
its understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn im not entirely sure,negative
coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie,negative
especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film,negative
things get more bizarre when were introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless cardflipping kitkat,negative
if thats not enough for you theres richard e grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover,negative
their crotchbiting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here,negative
wait maybe the only big laughs,negative
im not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk,negative
i cant even begin to start about the films absurd plot but lets not get into that,negative
i suppose theres some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise if they were that desperate,negative
but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where its going from minute one and from there its 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck,negative
theres only one presidential election every four years but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as the thriller of the year,negative
in 1997 weve had absolute power air force one shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600,negative
this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford trying to bring us a complex plot of coverup and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys,negative
heres what happens this time,negative
its night at the white house,negative
a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt,negative
the next day shes dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in,negative
how do we know hes a hotshot,negative
weve seen the traditional action flick opener the clever hostage negotiation scene,negative
its not so clever this time consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal exgovernment employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street,negative
snipes is off to the white house where he finds the secret service head the shiny bald head of daniel benzali wont cooperate with him at all,negative
in fact if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda snipes wouldnt have been allowed in the white house at all,negative
alda helps snipes out further assigning a sexy secret service agent diane lane to act as his liaison,negative
a very dangerous liaison,negative
well not really i just wanted to say that,negative
almost immediately a suspect is found an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos,negative
snipes doesnt buy it and launches into an independent investigation of his own one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the presidents son,negative
snipes partner an always wisecracking dennis miller calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane who at first doesnt believe snipes eventually and predictably comes around and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information,negative
for the first hour or so murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting,negative
sure we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon,negative
snipes and lane dont make for a bad action team but with nothing to work with theyre just cogs in the bad movie machine,negative
dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood and thats saying a lot,negative
when you get to the last halfhour the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer busting out the old breakintothebuilding underground climax,negative
and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why youll wish you never sat through this movie at all,negative
the 1600 in the movies title doesnt represent an address it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide,negative
serving the world for nearly 125th of a century,negative
i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films,negative
when done right with at least slightly evident restraint they can be engaging sweeping appealing,negative
but its a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle a hollow boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers the ones willing to buy into ephrons whiny views of life and romance,negative
tom hanks and meg ryan two of hollywoods most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed repectively,negative
baldwins wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son jonah seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse,negative
jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems,negative
sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out,negative
ephron has him do this so that annie reed meg ryan can hear it,negative
annie is a happy woman,negative
she is engaged to walter an allergyprone working man and seems to be perfectly content,negative
but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it,negative
five years after this movie hit theaters hanks ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better although still subpar romantic comedy youve got mail which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet,negative
at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity,negative
here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five,negative
the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory,negative
sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie odonnell,negative
but none of them can save the film from being a bore,negative
its characters are dull and empty its script isnt funny or particularly charming,negative
the script has a fundamental problem annie gives up for little reason her life with walter to pursue sleepless in seattle whom she has never even seen,negative
its the kind of life decision that real people dont make and its a major unforgivable plausibility sacrifice,negative
in essence this movies purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldnt even exist,negative
its a ten minute short film with ninetyfive minutes of filler,negative
if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didnt have to review it you could just call me asleep in philadelphia,negative
1999 eugene novikov137,negative
not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie,negative
earlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the years least likeable comedies called hanging up featuring a bunch of annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one in that film as well who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves,negative
ick real,negative
sweet stuff,negative
but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer with a film entitled battlefield earth,negative
i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film even if it was on a cheese factor as everybody and i mean everybody else pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time,negative
yipes another,negative
beauty,negative
so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie costarring the everversatile lisa kudrow,negative
uhhhm you guessed it not,negative
much,negative
plot in order to escape major financial difficulties a local weatherman hooks up with his ballpicking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery,negative
but as more and more people find out about their scheme more and more people demand a part of their winnings and more and more problems arise,negative
critique simply stated i didnt laugh once during this entire picture,negative
for a comedy it offered me a few smiles a bunch of nincompoops as characters a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow in what can only described as a sluttier version of her character of phoebe on tvs friends,negative
this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be but it was pretty close,negative
thankfully the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits dancing as the weatherman were left in the films trailer and not in this final cut,negative
and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far beautiful this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast,negative
foremost was travoltas character who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie,negative
and for me the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong,negative
he didnt fit the part,negative
i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role,negative
a cool calculating roughneck with a certain hip suave je ne sais quoi,negative
in this film he looks like hes trying to be funny trying to be bad trying to be good,negative
were not supposed to be able to notice that and when we do at least in my case i consider it a wrong choice in casting,negative
add that to lisa kudrow boring us with yet another one of her patented dumb blonde routines but this time dressed in sexier outfits,negative
michael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isnt quite up at the same speed level as everyone else,negative
and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells and youve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize,negative
the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually halfinteresting and never really bored me,negative
i also liked michael moores perverted cousin character and i loved and i say it again loved the character that bill pullman played,negative
give this dude his own movie,negative
he played a lazy cop a man who tries everything not to do any real work,negative
he fakes injuries to get off duty tries to avoid arrest situations so that he wont have to fill out any forms now,negative
theres a base of humor,negative
sadly the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film,negative
and theres not much else i can say about this movie folks,negative
on the whole it was lame included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines and very little of interest for any target audience,negative
but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and im there,negative
under any other circumstances i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review,negative
however in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful a minute dissection of the ending is necessary,negative
even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes do proceed at your own risk,negative
the movie opens quite poorly i might add as child psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolms past patients,negative
distraught the suicidal man a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself,negative
cut to the next fall as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case a trouble young man named cole haley joel osment one of the only child actors in a while i didnt want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument,negative
after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences we learn that cole has the sixth sense the gift of being able to communicate with the dead,negative
and this as they say is where the healing begins,negative
the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film one of roger eberts colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of siskel and ebert,negative
although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ive always been a sucker for surprise endings my favorite movie is the usual suspects and rarely dislike a film that sports one,negative
here since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the films conclusion the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending something ive fallen victim to in the past was eliminated,negative
and indeed my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment,negative
stripped of the element of surprise the film was put to the task of showing what it really had instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion,negative
after seeing its true colors i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is despite what the many champions of the movie may say void of any real power,negative
its a neat concept but not one that justifies being made into a featurelength movie,negative
in fact the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earthshattering revelation that is yet to come,negative
and when the final moments do come its a huge letdown the end makes no sense at all,negative
it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level,negative
i wont go into any details but suffice to say that as far as i can tell it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder,negative
now in all fairness i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending however stupid it may be had it not been revealed to me before hand,negative
however i feel very confident that i as well as anyone who had seen a few twilight zone episodes would have seen it coming a mile away,negative
the fact that moviegoers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped,negative
ironically to fully appreciate the best scene that of cole and malcolm attending a little girls funeral the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy,negative
i wouldnt have even known about this mental disease if i hadnt by pure dumb luck caught dateline nbc the other week when they did a feature story on it,negative
despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace in the end the sixth sense is too chalkfull of contradictions and just isnt plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation,negative
seen at amc old pasadena 8 pasadena ca in sdds,negative
paul verhoevens last movie showgirls had a bad script bad acting and a plot i use the word in its loosest possible sense that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity,negative
it stank,negative
starship troopers has a bad script bad acting and a plot that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore,negative
it stinks,negative
nobody will watch this movie for the plot but heres a brief synopsis anyway,negative
some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve armed forces at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy,negative
after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires the home city of the main characters war is declared,negative
this involves sending the grunts who include johnny rico van dien and dizzy meyer down to the surface of the bugs planet,negative
much carnage ensues,negative
the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call,negative
more carnage ensues,negative
after being rescued their plans are changed to capture a brain bug which is believed to be controlling the aliens battle plans look i didnt write this ok,negative
yet more carnage ensues,negative
get the picture,negative
interspersed throughout all this are brief ads from the federal network which present the picture of a neofascist state much like in verhoevens robocop,negative
there are many problems with starship troopers,negative
the plot where one exists to drive the movie onwards is silly,negative
harris star of tvs doogie howser md is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie apparently so we will accept his ability to mindmeld with a brain bug later on,negative
in addition the first thirty minutes of the movie until the characters sign up for service drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills 90210,negative
the characters are onedimensional so much so that when dizzy is killed she says its ok because she got to sleep with rico,negative
i had hoped that verhoevens use of a noname cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience but such an idea appears to have escaped him,negative
the dialogue is embarassing and isnt helped by the frequently terrible delivery i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species,negative
finally the fake ads become a nuisance,negative
although they evoke the propaganda of the wwiiera movietone reels as presumably they are meant to their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect,negative
some people will say all of thats irrelevant the movie hinges on the battle scenes,negative
so what about those battle scenes,negative
well i admit the effects are good the bugs move about quite convincingly especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs,negative
and people have their brains blown out their limbs cut off and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways,negative
but this is my problem,negative
the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore and its continous attempt to gross us out starting early on when richards character vomits onscreen,negative
verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success but fails spectacularly,negative
while robocop had a message about the importance of being human and gave the bad guys some motivation starship troopers lacks even these simple features,negative
when the brain bug sucks out a characters brain near the end of the film its merely an analogy for what the film has done to us,negative
this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16,negative
im guessing and from the available evidence its not a great guess that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess stupidity ego and powermongering,negative
if so the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history,negative
it has already been welldocumented that the original title an alan smithee film became a problem when miserable test screenings forced recuts against the will of director arthur hiller prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guildmandated pseudonym of alan smithee,negative
that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor,negative
and you could just smell the disaster brewing,negative
if youre unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn youll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up,negative
ostensibly its a pseudodocumentary account of a director named alan smithee eric idle who loses control of a bigbudget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone whoopi goldberg and jackie chan all of whom appear as themselves,negative
when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called an alan smithee film which of course it already is smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it,negative
among the parties interviewed are the films producer james edmunds ryan oneal and studio boss jerry glover richard jeni who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them,negative
its bad enough that burn hollywood burn has literally not a single laugh for its entire blissfully brief 84 minutes,negative
what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once but twice or even three times,negative
michael ovitz references showgirls references oral sex references whoopi danson references all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stockintrade,negative
the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency notably with the hilarious use of the word feminist as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film,negative
by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent filmmakers the brothers brothers cleverly identified as bad a and badder a among other unprintable things you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified,negative
those documentary captions for all their leaden obviousness allow the best insight into whats so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn,negative
not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears,negative
the producer is a liar who slept in the white house the media are maggots and leeches working for publications like the new york slimes and newsleak with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you dont miss the joke,negative
it doesnt even matter that eszterhas tags penile implant after his own name when he makes a cameo because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign selfdeprecation,negative
this is a petulant schoolboys idea of satire pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth,negative
the last stomachchurning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with outtakes over the closing credits the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away,negative
perhaps it was just a final desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career,negative
pity everyone involved with this excessive egodriven satire of excess and ego,negative
its too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this,negative
otherwise you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees,negative
synopsis melissa a mentallydisturbed woman who likes to smoke seduces doug a minorleague baseball player who likes to study anatomy work on motorcycles and make out with his girlfriend in a public library,negative
when doug decides to stop seeing her melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him including his girlfriend his mother and his cat,negative
comments malicious i suppose is an acceptable moview for what it is a cheap bmovie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurnedpsycholoverwhowantsrevenge films like fatal attraction hand that rocks the cradle etc etc that have come before it,negative
malicious however really doesnt provide very many particularly suspenseful moments,negative
the plot starts off energetically enough the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film,negative
it starts to drag unfortunately after this,negative
melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug as always seems to happen in movies like these but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other better thrillers before,negative
she drugs someone,negative
she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriends apartment,negative
and of course she stalks so we see a number of shots which are supposed to be suspenseful where shes spying on doug and his girlfriend,negative
i wont reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey but i warn you that its both painfully obvious and a real yawner,negative
john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the notsobright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa one of the scripts faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a premed student,negative
the same cannot be said though for molly ringwald,negative
at times she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine especially during her silent imgoingtostareyoudown scenes,negative
at other times however she just seems somehow goofy and out of place,negative
in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful she screeches fk you you bd and throws a phone,negative
she delivers the line so ridiculously that one cant help but laugh,negative
malicious certainly isnt the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there but it isnt all that good or original either,negative
feel free to treat this film maliciously watch something else,negative
funny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways,negative
the ghost and the darkness promised at least it seemed to me to promise a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature,negative
what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000level material an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters,negative
get new jobs,negative
was one line if i remember correctly,negative
at the end of the 19th century col patterson val kilmer whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda,negative
he is having immensely stereotypical problems the natives are restless his boss is a jerk and now two maneating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off,negative
patterson tries to handle the situation himself incompetently and then turns to charles remington michael douglas a hunter of world reknown or something like that,negative
the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions they should have gotten top billing and costarred with siegfried and roy,negative
they are nighinvulnerable as one comic book put it and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature,negative
give me a break,negative
the movie hasnt got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas its just trying to find convenient ways to stall us,negative
even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic,negative
get this remingtons big plan is to build a large scaffoldlike structure in the middle of the savannah sit on it and wait for the lion to show up,negative
he does this and then gets knocked off by a bird,negative
by the end of the movie the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand,negative
the acting is forgettable,negative
douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow but its nothing he hasnt done before,negative
kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else somewhere else and the rest vanish into the cinematography,negative
the camera by the way sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent,negative
what did i expect from this movie,negative
i dunno,negative
some real excitement i suppose,negative
a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation,negative
no such luck,negative
i dug out my tattered copy of hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind,negative
come on hollywood surprise me,negative
stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset,negative
the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls,negative
personal because his niece is one of the victims,negative
its a slobbering psychopath of course but this time theres a twist,negative
freeman notes that each of the young women whove disappeared are all strong willed assertive and more successful in their careers than the average girl,negative
we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova whose aim is to dominate these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem,negative
anyway one of the women manages to escape ashly judd and teams up with freeman to well,negative
you know the rest,negative
a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story,negative
perhaps but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue,negative
so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further okay,negative
and as for comparisons to seven oh,negative
please,negative
kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass,negative
maybe the novel was a stinker to start with but whatever the case its the writing thats clearly at fault here,negative
one these characters have very little to say thats engaging or interesting,negative
two the script has no sense of humour,negative
three while the notion of a psychos victims being smart successful women is an interesting twist the execution isnt even half as good as the idea,negative
thus ashly judd comes across all out of focus instead of being the heart of the story,negative
we cant feel her rage,negative
some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that shes the nobullshit 90s type but these conversations barely register,negative
and as for freeman kiss the girls is his second dog in a year first chain reaction now this,negative
for an actor of his calibre this is most worrying,negative
young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fictionesque things to do in denver when your dead,negative
but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this,negative
not much and you can hardly blame him,negative
theres a few wellstaged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls dives and jumps and the effect is startling,negative
but the script is beyond rescue,negative
what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up,negative
complacency rules its been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue,negative
the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie positive proof that the best things in life arent free,negative
prereview note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review,negative
because of this i will try to vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not its most likely just another way of referring to sex,negative
i think wed all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review,negative
though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what,negative
body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way youd normally expect to see a violent attack,negative
its about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it,negative
these are things we all do sometimes,negative
the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts,negative
their lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed,negative
its as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek,negative
at its core body shots is a message movie the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition,negative
michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is a moralist with nothing new to say,negative
his characters dont communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera,negative
they voice simplistic platitudes like i like to come or sex without love equals violence,negative
huh,negative
and yes that is as complex as this movies observations get,negative
the characters are stupid and shallow with not one registering as anything more,negative
the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events,negative
we meet the characters as they speak directly to us confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy,negative
i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this film i cannot,negative
im not trying to be clever or witty but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others,negative
with the exception of trent played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin,negative
i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence,negative
in between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning,negative
the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me,negative
this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining,negative
if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f kobsessed fine i dont have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side,negative
additionally that one side isnt even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness,negative
or realism,negative
one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters,negative
they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isnt it erotic it isnt real,negative
it doesnt feel like an authentic sexual encounter,negative
every f k scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner,negative
body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film,negative
it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it,negative
the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow,negative
the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred,negative
the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off,negative
this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me i cant think of one film that has done so and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80s next to wall street,negative
unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off,negative
paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded,negative
it was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fallout of such a decision,negative
the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed to care about them,negative
he gave them heart,negative
cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones,negative
he preaches to us by using his characters to preach to us,negative
this is not the way to get any message across,negative
why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins,negative
cristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and with a helping of leering exploitation,negative
i cried during babe,negative
i admit it,negative
the special effects the story the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a childrens film so much so that yes i got a little overly sentimental,negative
such my friend is the power of cinema,negative
when word came out that they were using this newly developed for a doctor dolittle update in which eddie murphy plays the title character and many great comic actors supply the voices my anticipation rose to great expectations,negative
they cant possibly drop the ball on this one,negative
cant miss,negative
cant possibly miss,negative
they missed,negative
what went wrong,negative
after much thought i supply three general rules,negative
1 dont let a television actressturnedcomedy movie director near an urbanite script i e penny marshalls dreadful preachers wife,negative
betty thomas worked wonders with the brady bunch movie but the same sitcomairiness doesnt quite work here,negative
its as if she lifted a generic sitcom and iced it with light doses of modern rb,negative
take away the black cast take away the atrocious soundtrack and you have the residue of some mid80s kirk cameron show,negative
2 the greater the cast the less the individual castmember has to do i e,negative
con air,negative
it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman garry schandling john leguizimo ellen degeneres and gilbert godfried in your lineup but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped stereotyped characters onelineatatime,negative
its even worse because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you dont get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits,negative
now there are three character actors who do get special treatment albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project hes in and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy,negative
norm mcdonald fares nearly as well as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle,negative
but theres little humor here,negative
that rests on the shoulders of chris rock sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wiseass guinea pig,negative
even the mouth is illsynched,negative
3 dont let the special effects technicians walk away with the script,negative
theres a certain timing thats mandatory in comedy,negative
to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim hensons creature shop is a travesty,negative
this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies arent welltimed laughfests with the right director they can be and have,negative
here betty thomas is clearly over her head,negative
i wish i could commend the special effects but theyre merely average,negative
count the number of times where the animals mouth is turned away from the camera or too far to notice or illsynched,negative
this is less a babe and more of a look whos barking clone,negative
you may be wondering how does eddie murphy fare,negative
well he came back with the exceptional nutty professor and i dont doubt he can come back again,negative
here hes tied into a straight man and given little to do,negative
the exceptions are when he fears hes going crazy a far cry from his smarterthanyoud expect routine that hes more adept at,negative
its unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years,negative
after all this whats left,negative
butt jokes,negative
a lot of butt jokes,negative
i guess for kids that may be funny but i was stonefaced,negative
if theres a lesson the film may be telling us is that animals have feelings too and they care way too much for your butt,negative
would you believe in real life i mean that if you were julia roberts that youd be the ugly underdog to your sister the creepy catherine zetajones,negative
let me tell you what reality is,negative
reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot,negative
thats reality,negative
americas sweethearts is the opposite of reality a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy alsoran presumably because she wears hornrimmed glasses and used to be overweight uhhuh,negative
the plot follows two married megamovie stars gwen and eddie zetajones and poor poor john cusack whose material gets worse every year on the eve of their new star vehicles release a film called time over time,negative
the only problem gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation and the press and public have not been forgiving think meg and dennis,negative
gosh and the director has vanished with the film holding the only print hostage,negative
veteran pr agent lee billy crystal is called upon to clean up the mess throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie presumably distracting the stupid stupid film critics into forgetting they havent seen the movie at all,negative
note to sony any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab,negative
and did i mention gwens sister kiki roberts is along for the ride,negative
and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way,negative
oh billy youre a scamp,negative
the script youve cowritten with peter tolan what planet are you from,negative
and bedazzled need i say more is a roast of hollywood and celebrity sure but its not a funny one,negative
yes crystal tells us hollywood is lying to our faces,negative
if you are surprised by this you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine,negative
its about to expire,negative
aside from a scant few zingers yeah se or winces rules,negative
americas sweethearts jokes arent funny its pace is choppy and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project not for headlining star julia roberts but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself,negative
i didnt time it the movies not that bad but its crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film,negative
bad move billy your jokes suck,negative
the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movies gags and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene how this movie earned a pg13 rating is a mystery to me,negative
julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friends wedding into a winning film but not even that 90tooth smile can save her here,negative
obviously aware of the ugliness before him director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria as a lisping spaniard christopher walken the insane time over time director and alan arkin a new age guru in a fright wig to crack wise,negative
none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken azaria comes off as a preening queen when hes supposed to be macho,negative
as for roth in case you dont know went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio revolution which produced this work,negative
hes back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years,negative
itll probably be another 11 before hes back again,negative
i could drone on about how americas sweethearts will only appeal to the mouthbreathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies but that would get old,negative
instead ill settle for discussing the movies worst sin that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable not just in its plot but in its sentiment,negative
every single character in this film with the arguable exception of kiki is simply hateful and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains,negative
when you leave the theater youll ask yourself too why would i want any of these jerks to be happy,negative
violence is bad,negative
violence is ugly,negative
violence breeds yet more violence,negative
kids dont try this at home,negative
this weighty message isnt the only barrier to enjoying brother but its certainly one of the largest,negative
written directed by and starring the infamous takeshi kitano kikujiro sonatine brother is his first film made outside his familial japan bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles,negative
yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia,negative
if you piss a family member off or dishonor yourself in any way the usual punishment is public display of selfmutilation usually resulting in the loss of limbs,negative
a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another,negative
it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from,negative
unfortunately the film doesnt give too much of an explanation assuming its audience is aware of kitanos earlier work,negative
there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something but you never know what,negative
then theres a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family,negative
granted this is one of the best scenes in the movie but it doesnt make a lot of sense,negative
instead the two hours are basically spent watching the following people go out and shoot each other talk about it for tenplus minutes then go out and do it again,negative
the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning,negative
there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose,negative
all of the sudden yamamoto kitano has a girlfriend,negative
he barely speaks to her treats her like crap and then sends her away,negative
another missed opportunity considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states is the combination of cultures which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes,negative
though slow moving brother does have good elements,negative
the action scenes are well directed clearly defined and interesting to watch,negative
some of the violence is more hinted at than shown which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for,negative
the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do,negative
shirases masaya kato loud sarcastic coolness set against yamamotos quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination,negative
their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show,negative
also to its credit brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism,negative
a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash,negative
sure people get rich but they can also lose just as easily,negative
its a great moral with a great cast just not much substance to back it up,negative
a big busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch the great white hype stars samuel l jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging payperview revenues is to invent a white contender peter berg to challenge his black heavyweight champ damon wayans,negative
the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs white than black vs black,negative
he may be right in an absurdly accurate way but the film doesnt give us a reason to care,negative
as a scathing sports spoof hype is just that unfunny unfocused and at times just plain pointless,negative
as a commentary on race relations its even less effective,negative
the dialogue is the best of this mess lines like jon lovitz exclaiming i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs,negative
writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang though we never hear enough of it,negative
the script isnt strong enough though to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin house party,negative
he comes across as absolute overkill,negative
the great white hype almost turns around at the end at the big match when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rockconcert proportions,negative
with costumed dwarfs gangsta rappers and the champ dressed as death only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that shouldve been,negative
you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the odd couple ii sneak preview,negative
they were as happy a group of men as ive ever encountered,negative
what a great movie exclaimed one gent at the urinal everything was so true,negative
yeah laughed a man standing next to him i drive as slow as that one guy did,negative
my kids give me holy hell for it,negative
and peeing is a big part of my day just like with felix chuckled another fellow as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife,negative
if youre over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit neil simons the odd couple ii may be just the film for you,negative
others will likely be less charitable,negative
while the odd couple ii is amiable enough neil simons shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slappedtogether tv reunion show suffering from wheezing situation comedy setups and jokes straight out of the borschtbelt,negative
simon once the toast of broadway has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson missouri,negative
the contrived story involving the marriage of their kids provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger who havent seen each other in 17 years,negative
the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and quite literally run into one another at the airport,negative
they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina get lost and have a series of wacky adventures on the road,negative
jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob,negative
while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that theyve headlined three films together since 1993 grumpy old men grumpier old men and out to sea,negative
still the two veteran actors are fun to watch,negative
matthau whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes has a field day as oscar the crown prince of the curmudgeons,negative
lemmon looking pastier than usual is fine as the ever annoying felix who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of phnah,negative
phnah,negative
despite their bickering the characters have real affection for each other providing a welcome respite from the nonstop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together,negative
unfortunately matthau and lemmons charm isnt enough to compensate for simons hack script which wouldnt pass muster even on a upn sitcom,negative
one contrived situation follows another lathered with enough stale one liners to supply a dozen wouldbe comics on openmike night at the local comedy club,negative
if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements,negative
burger king gets one as does the el pollo loco taco joint but budget renta car really hits the jackpot,negative
between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name i couldnt keep count of all the plugs,negative
i did however keep track of some of the swearing,negative
i came up with four goddamns three shitheads and two fucks,negative
the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word,negative
its sad that a writer of neil simons stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise,negative
one running gag involves oscar and felixs inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held,negative
at one point the men actually spend 30 seconds just freeassociating riffing off variants of the word san,negative
the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing,negative
one of the oldest maxims of filmgoing is beware of movies that use the authors name in the title,negative
neil simons the odd couple ii is no exception to the rule,negative
while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon it has no business playing in a movie theater,negative
of course theres a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word ive written and would probably whip my youngwhippersnapper ass to boot,negative
one things for sure though,negative
theyll never catch me in a car chase,negative
plot set in the future a courier has uploaded some data into a hard drive that resides in his head and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information,negative
since he overloaded his hard drive hes also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him,negative
critique incoherent boring oneact drivel with no suspense horribly unbelievable futuristic environment bad dialogue careerdefining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending,negative
its too bad because the premise of the film was interesting but unfortunately for my friends and i this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us,negative
its one of those films that makes you start laughing halfway through when you realize that most of the actors in it suck the location shots are filmed in dark junkyard type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic whatever and all the sets look like well,negative
sets,negative
there is also absolutely no arc to this story,negative
it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings,negative
gibson should stick to writing novels and xfiles episodes since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage,negative
some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass henry rollins as a pumpedup cyberdoctor or something and icet as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face dont ask,negative
the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghostlady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point,negative
im ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal canada but sadly enough for us all it was,negative
some of the cybertravelling special effects were okay hence the 210 but overall its one of those bad movies thats just funny to watch and cringe at,negative
thankfully for keanu he redeemed his scifi career with 1999s the matrix 7 510,negative
its too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars as of 1999 director robert longo never directed another fullfeature film,negative
hmmm now,negative
isnt that odd,negative
writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 after being rejected for the draft,negative
he lived in toronto at first but since 1972 has made vancouver his home,negative
his 1984 novel neuromancer and its sequels 1986s count zero and 1988s mona lisa overdrive are generally considered to be the definitive works of the cyberpunk sciencefiction subgenre,negative
this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the worst actor category in the 1996 razzie awards,negative
lets get this one over with as quickly as possible,negative
if there was a possibility to receive a refund this review would not be forthcoming,negative
but as it is godzilla is without a doubt the loudest longest and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio,negative
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch last year at merienbad until they can grasp the idea of content and plot,negative
no amount of hype no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine billy the kid vs,negative
dracula,negative
godzilla opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs,negative
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins,negative
well the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature,negative
later a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache jean reno interview the sole survivor,negative
in a state of shock the only thing the man can utter is the word gojira the japanese name of the famed beast,negative
we are then introduced to dr nick tatopoulos matthew broderick with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film,negative
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population,negative
he is immediately drafted by the u s military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature,negative
in a short amount of time another fishing boat loaded with canned tuna from the u s and korea for some reason is found grounded in jamaica,negative
well it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york,negative
when the beast finally appears he tears up one building stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert thumbs up for new york,negative
the military with dr tatopouloss help have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system,negative
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr tatopoulos who snaps the beasts picture,negative
the monster eats the fish the military starts shooting and the chase is on with the army causing 90 of the ensuing damage,negative
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple dr totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open even though new york has been evacuated,negative
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant,negative
needless to say no one believes the good doctor about his discovery so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monsters nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city even though the monster isnt dead yet,negative
i sincerely hope that ive completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film,negative
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous or foolish enough to drop down an hours wage on this tripe,negative
everything about godzilla reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast,negative
the script and lets be clear here by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years razzie award,negative
the dialogue between maria pitillo as audrey timmonds dr tatopoulos estranged girlfriend and mr broderick is so adolescent it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief as happened during the screening i witnessed,negative
the film could be enjoyably campy if it didnt take itself so damn seriously,negative
but to what end as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind,negative
no godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it,negative
the film is bleak and ugly looking,negative
taking place at night during a rain storm the movie has little or no depth,negative
everything is ugly and dark,negative
new york has never looked so inhospitable since death wish,negative
in an attempt to give the film some color audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue,negative
the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica where dr tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint,negative
the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up,negative
you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint,negative
for a scientist this is very poor observation,negative
lets look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film this activity is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game,negative
1 why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs and how do those eggs fuse into one beast,negative
2 why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate such as new york to nest,negative
i dont think iguanas have a habit of migrating,negative
3 how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system slice a submarine in half yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin in comparison steel cable on the brooklyn bridge,negative
4 the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need its suspension cables,negative
5 did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly,negative
if so then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures,negative
note each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide,negative
godzilla would have to be over 1 000 feet tall to carry them all,negative
6 godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters but new york cabs are made of stronger steel,negative
7 godzilla can out maneuver helicopters bullets torpedoes and missiles but cant catch you on foot,negative
8 taxis can out maneuver godzilla,negative
9 godzilla can burrow through the subway system but cant tear through the park avenue tunnel,negative
10 why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla,negative
maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel,negative
11 galapagos iguanas actually live in the french polynesian islands,negative
12 why was dr tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway,negative
13 how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey,negative
14 new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting,negative
new yorkers hate beta cam,negative
i could go on and on but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is,negative
dont be fooled this film has less gray matter than any episode of americas funniest home videos,negative
the performances in the film are singularly bland,negative
not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror,negative
the characters in the midst of the onslaught have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee failed relationships career choices,negative
the only common occurrence that doesnt take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement but then that would have made them believable,negative
godzilla for the most part is okay,negative
the design of the beast is funky if not very memorable,negative
one thing that comes to mind the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark namely his atomic breath,negative
now i for one cant quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait,negative
a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly,negative
there is so much wrong with this film that i cant really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted except for my divorce,negative
any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac,negative
the addition of the baby raptors ah i meant godzillas are nothing but a direct rip off of jurassic park but with none of that films suspense or tension,negative
suffice to say that godzilla is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade,negative
this is a film that needed the hype,negative
with the current level of writing and directing nothing else about the film succeeds,negative
if youve seen the trailers youve seen the best parts,negative
my only suggestion for mr d and mr e is that they could always go back to selling shoes,negative
this film could be the next rocky horror,negative
only its not funny,negative
suicide is pointless everyone should know that,negative
so whats this movie like,negative
you guessed it,negative
pointless,negative
the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them,negative
when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever,negative
thats what the press materials for the film probably say,negative
now heres what i say the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time,negative
boring arty pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as,negative
well as committing suicide,negative
the movie lost me early on immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window,negative
the girls father james woods holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on,negative
then as the scene ends the lawn sprinklers come on,negative
is that a joke,negative
is that supposed to be amusing in some way,negative
from then on the movie failed to draw me back in,negative
performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides,negative
woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well,negative
dunst has the potential to be a big star if she chooses her projects well,negative
and while this film is awful she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed,negative
there are also a few cameos in the film here and there which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more,negative
as a result they all seem rather pointless although theres a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since,negative
well since eddie and the cruisers,negative
perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters,negative
we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what theyre feeling,negative
all we really know is that mrs lisbon kathleen turner is strict and keeps them on a short leash,negative
what mother doesnt,negative
its certainly no reason to commit suicide,negative
with the godfather part iii sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera,negative
with the virgin suicides she proves she has no business behind it either,negative
having family connections doesnt entitle you to be allowed to make movies,negative
so attention film directors,negative
stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry,negative
just because they share your dna doesnt mean they share your talent,negative
r,negative
soldier is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesnt have jean claude van damme in it,negative
i could liken it to the scifi cheese that was the hollywood productofchoice back in the early 80s but that would be too much of a compliment,negative
if there is a movie theater in hell this film is playing there 24 hours a day,negative
the story such that there is revolves around todd kurt russell an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a nottoodistant ultraconservative future is there any other kind,negative
after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy,negative
who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesnt matter because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys,negative
after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash yes folks theres more we see todd as a buff scarred adult now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat,negative
theres a new wrinkle though,negative
todd and his brethren are declared obsolete and a new batch of soldiers takes their place,negative
after losing a sanctioned battle with dragons jason scott lee the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying icecube tray well thats what is looked like on a remote garbage planet,negative
if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them youre way ahead of the game,negative
the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you halfexpect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute,negative
its surprising that soldier is the brainchild of blade runner cowriter david webb peoples,negative
unlike that mindtwisting classic this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three doublespaced pages,negative
add into the mix the mortal kombats paul anderson inept direction and its easy to see how soldier turned out so bad,negative
and the special effects,negative
remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars,negative
gary busey is in this movie,negative
nuff said,negative
soldier is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults,negative
that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all,negative
now if youll excuse me i have to go weep for the future,negative
the 44 caliber killer has struck again,negative
starring john leguizamo mira sorvino adrian brody jennifer esposito michael rispoli bebe neuwirth,negative
rated r,negative
summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lees abilities,negative
lee is a great filmmaker often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg,negative
but here he gets himself into a bind,negative
his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work,negative
the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city,negative
it was the hottest summer on record,negative
to boot new yorks first serial killer was on the loose calling himself the son of sam david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population,negative
so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout people went berserk causing billions of dollars in damage to the city,negative
the movies focus is on a group of twentysomethings during that fateful summer vinny john leguizamo a clubhopping adultrous hairdresser his benevolent wife dionna mira sorvino looking young ritchie adrian brody a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters,negative
we follow them through their roller coaster lives thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings,negative
vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him make him stay faithful to her,negative
ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more eccentric and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend,negative
tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sams first murder looms the night he promises he will strike again,negative
a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects,negative
at the top of the list is ritchie,negative
vinny an unwilling part of the said group is called upon to set a trap for his friend,negative
as we watch these proceedings some of which are painfully graphic the dreaded so what,negative
question springs to mind,negative
from the way this movie is made id have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find,negative
lee touches on so much the media the 70s punk scene the details of the actual killings as well as the characters very personal dilemmas but he doesnt bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement,negative
all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable,negative
too bad summer of sam doesnt get any help here,negative
frankly its a bore a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesnt entertain beyond its first half hour,negative
there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague,negative
leguizamos turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny,negative
the script makes it clear that were supposed to believe that his character is flawed but still a good guy,negative
youd never guess from his performance,negative
adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better,negative
sorvino gives a riveting touching performance in a banal movie im tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane her character is affecting and her emotions truetoheart,negative
brody too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for,negative
summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film it looks great it has a few notable performances and i suppose its pretty well directed in a purely technical way,negative
but its also empty pretentious and boring,negative
like last years the thin red line its a movie by a director who doesnt know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway,negative
1999 eugene novikov137,negative
deserves recognition for achieving the nearimpossible task of making a grander monument to selflove than steven seagals on deadly ground,negative
capsule review a question after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld what in the were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another postapocalyptic movie thinking,negative
in this 3 hour advertisement for his new hair weave costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employees uniform and gradually turns a nukedout usa into an idealized hippydippy society,negative
judging by the costuming at the end of the movie the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in reinventing polyester,negative
when hes not pointing the camera directly at himself director costner does have a nice visual sense and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trustnoone 90s but by the time the second hour rolled around i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes,negative
mark this one return to sender,negative
there isnt much good about this movie,negative
not much i can say about the acting directing or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie,negative
so ill get my one good comment out of the way at least joel schuemacher batman robin didnt direct it or it would be titled technicolor city,negative
in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end,negative
the plot has a tendency to be interesting but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie,negative
the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets so i will just touch on the bare minimum,negative
john murdoch rufus sewell awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel only to find out he has forgotten everything,negative
john must find out who he is before the strangers a k a,negative
mind erasing aliens find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy,negative
during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality and the existence of inherently evil people,negative
any of these points however are completely erased from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script,negative
as i mentioned earlier nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film,negative
the acting is bland and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care,negative
the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake a sign of a true bmovie,negative
the direction is poor and there is little continuity not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly,negative
lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality and doesnt deserve to have the word science in sciencefiction,negative
if i havent got my point across ill say it more plainly this is a bad movie,negative
lets hope the next movie by alex i wish i was tim burton proyas is at least tolerable,negative
new address,negative
same old attitude,negative
dont forget to recommend a film read the journal or send me some of that nasty hate mail,negative
starring bruce willis billy bob thornton liv tyler ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j j,negative
abrams directed by michael bay,negative
it rocksactually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film,negative
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they landonce in a while when we need a break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like,negative
nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur,negative
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon a steroid users answer to deep impact,negative
bruce willis stars as harry stamper a famed oildriller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet,negative
why an oil driller,negative
they require someone experienced with deepcore mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid,negative
in one unintentionally,negative
hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect a deepcore driller they built based on his own blueprints it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it,negative
we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids,negative
harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including a blond guy a fat guy a black guy a wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck,negative
once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes,negative
whether or not they save the day i will not reveal,negative
nor will you care,negative
i will say this you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope,negative
willis has barely a chance to come alive ditto for affleck,negative
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material,negative
steve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic,negative
rockhound as hes called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to a chair where he spends most of the film,negative
so why did they bring him up there to begin with,negative
rather why write him into the film give,negative
his almostwitty oneliners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig,negative
im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue,negative
liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her fathers bands aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack,negative
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie onscreen,negative
the middle hour is a nonsensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain,negative
whenever someone dies in this movie a crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead persons last name here,negative
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oilguycumastronaut from a live one and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood,negative
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla,negative
it looks nicer and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework,negative
it has a vivid soundmix,negative
but at almost twoandahalf hours i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story,negative
the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanicfever,negative
bollocks,negative
the lovers in the film are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a mooncrawler,negative
remember a little film called jaws,negative
in this film three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark,negative
they didnt much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another,negative
one of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories,negative
this is the sort of malebonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end,negative
not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesid be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called,negative
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery,negative
to this i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldnt build a birdhouse,negative
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life,negative
man this was one wierd movie,negative
similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldnt decide which genre it is,negative
the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship,negative
the last half hour,negative
this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it lets just kill everybody,negative
from then on forget scifi this,negative
movie becomes 100 horror,negative
what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way,negative
instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyones,negative
seen it all before and knows when to expect it,negative
the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew,negative
there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this,negative
then finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video,negative
the acting isnt too bad at all considering what the actors had to work with anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of,negative
there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space,negative
this movie could have been so much better,negative
it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with,negative
there was just nothing new here that any of us havent seen before in aliens or hellraiser,negative
play it to the bone the newest addition to ron sheltons sports themed repertoire fails in numerous ways,negative
like most of sheltons other great films bull durham white men cant jump this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots,negative
sheltons films are not considered sports films but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story,negative
shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions,negative
play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse,negative
the film has no social message like its predecessors,negative
the relationship between the friends two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars is very confusing for a number of reasons,negative
the whole film since it is primarily a buddy picture depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other,negative
unfortunately it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below,negative
1 we never see how cesar antonio banderas and vince woody harrelson meet,negative
the two are so different from each other that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory,negative
2 vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas,negative
there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something,negative
3 the third character on the trip grace lolita davidovich stands in the way,negative
she is in nearly every scene with them making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other,negative
4 there are two many interfering irrelevant side stories,negative
vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner,negative
these boring tales only hurt the central plot,negative
5 when it comes to time for the two men to fight they dont even hesitate to pound each other,negative
wasnt the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other,negative
by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with the film wants to be over,negative
shelton on the other hand continues to tell his story,negative
forty five painful minutes remain,negative
the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies,negative
however the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile kind of like the whole film,negative
for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality trois is surprisingly tame,negative
despite its lurid subject matter and its passing nod to fatal attraction it moves along with flat uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film,negative
freshly moved to atlanta jermaine dourdan and his wife jasmine moore have the trappings of a perfect life,negative
they have a beautiful house in suburbia,negative
jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm,negative
jasmine is his supportive wife who is finishing up her college degree,negative
in an opening montage via a home video of the pair we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs,negative
this is a couple that has it all,negative
into this eden slithers the lure of lust,negative
despite his outward appearance jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person,negative
a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business oblivious to jasmines concerns,negative
we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage atrois much to jasmines dismay,negative
as jermaine puts it dont you want to be sexually free,negative
jermaine shares his desire with coworker terrence smith who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter,negative
the woman jade palmer is a direct counterpoint to jasmine,negative
jade at one point was a college student too,negative
unlike jasmine she found herself pregnant dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet,negative
to further reinforce their differences its revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son,negative
inevitably through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaines part the forbidden act is consummated,negative
the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaines property with the hint that the violence may escalate,negative
by this point trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama a fatal attraction without the social significance,negative
the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical,negative
jermaine comes off as insincere sexually driven and selfish,negative
jasmine is bland and subservient,negative
jade comes off a bit sympathetically but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy,negative
yet another tale of a sexually aggressive dog of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating innocent mate,negative
the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve but by this point will you even care,negative
if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending perhaps there could have been some freshness to it,negative
as it stands trois is pretty standard fare,negative
all right all right we get the point despite all similarities to the bestselling story speechless is not based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin,negative
in fact the script was in development well before 1992,negative
still the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes a critical difference,negative
no its not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers its that carville and matalins story is actually interesting,negative
speechless is a limp poorly structured wouldbe romantic comedy,negative
speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep,negative
what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is a sitcom writer brought in to punch up the republican candidates speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate,negative
at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer,negative
but there are plent of obstacles in the way including julias studreporter fiance christopher reeve and a series of stunts which continue to prove that alls fair in love and politics,negative
the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that theyre crazy about each other,negative
screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each others arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism,negative
its a noble attempt to shake things up but unfortunately it just doesnt work,negative
part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know theyre attracted to each other and were left with waiting for the campaign to end so theyll admit that they love each other already,negative
there is such a herkyjerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even kings sharp dialogue cant prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour,negative
inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performances most of their scenes together,negative
the problems begin with their initial courtship which does virtually nothing to establish julias character and merely establishes that kevin is a wiseass,negative
davis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit,negative
in a couple of scenes like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection,negative
for the most part however theyre just actors spouting lines,negative
you keep waiting for a little spark and it never happens,negative
perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechlesss politics,negative
the setting seems perfect for a high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix but thats never the tone that underwood is going for,negative
he wants a warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaimans fluteandwind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background,negative
it might as well have been a story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be,negative
i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert kings previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so i had some hopes for speechless,negative
but while there is wit in the words this is a script which was probably much better on paper,negative
on screen its still paper thin,negative
so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful scifi films such as close encounters of the third kind 2001 a space odyssey apollo 13 and contact,negative
well whatever it is youd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange considering the disastrous results were left with here,negative
this is a film that takes a little bit of everything but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing,negative
its like i said this,negative
movie sucks,negative
plot a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet,negative
critique extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie,negative
uneven would be another,negative
the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the buzz around it had been soso and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes all leading you to believe that its actually going to go somewhere,negative
but it isnt long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherrycolored planet tries too hard to get us into the pain of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix,negative
in a scifi movie,negative
well i dont know much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half only to figure out some big secret in the end a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement,negative
ultimately this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise joins the crew in their misadventures in space for the main crux of its journey and eventually settles down for one of the most anticlimactic endings this side of contact,negative
mind you if you enjoyed that films shrugoftheshoulders ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well,negative
of course i dont remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story,negative
ugh,negative
what a friggin mess,negative
films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again,negative
didnt anybody recognize the crappiness in this script,negative
didnt they read the bad dialogue the cheezy lines the obvious derivative nature of the work mind you with a director like depalma at the helm that aint saying much,negative
of course you cant really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry oconnell in this fine crew of thespians,negative
nuff said,negative
neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the films musical score during the last fifteen minutes presumably in order to wake the audience up okay we get it brian this scene is supposed to be powerful wow yawn my,negative
ears hurt,negative
so is anything salvageable in this movie,negative
sure,negative
gary sinise does another great job as does cheadle the film doesnt completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sandtwister effect that you see in the commercial is well done,negative
other than that,negative
i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies oops,negative
did i say admire i meant am disgusted,negative
all in all this movie delivers very little in actual substance offers twobit dialogue masked in a lot of scifi mumbojumbo pretends to be deep when really its just sappy and eventually just settles into an ending which other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck,negative
go see the ninth gate now,negative
theres a great movie,negative
and on a personal note i think its time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12minute uninterrupted film sequences and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting,negative
one of the 90s most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave its the from hell movie,negative
starting in the early nineties we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationshipsfromhell,negative
there were boyfriends from hell friendly neighborhood cops from hell nannies from hell and even secretaries from hell,negative
but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush the motherinlaw from hell,negative
the motherinlaw in question is martha played by jessica lange,negative
she has been singlehandedly running the family horse farm kilronan,negative
her son jackson johnathon schaech and his girlfriend helen gwyneth paltrow live in new york and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan,negative
but those intentions are about to change,negative
you see martha lives by manipulation,negative
she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses,negative
now she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson,negative
though at first helen finds martha charming soon she is caught in the domineering marthas web of deception,negative
its hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha schemes,negative
as written most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted,negative
but then the film even treats the audience like idiots,negative
it tries to get away with things like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place without even batting an eye,negative
then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isnt one thats likely to question details,negative
jessica langes martha is the only semideveloped character in the film and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can,negative
a character that could have been simply awful is merely groanworthy,negative
gwyneth paltrow doesnt have much to build upon as helens only character trait seems to be daughterinlaw,negative
still she fares better than johnathon schaech whose character is so nonexistent hes inexplicably missing for much of the film,negative
still there have been much worse from hell films,negative
even with its paperthin characters and ludicrous setups hush manages to create a few thrills in a colorbynumbers fashion,negative
you know whats coming but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two,negative
the old formulas are around for a reason but that doesnt mean they taste fresh,negative
there s nothing quite like a gory anime,negative
really and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it,negative
with anime a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword,negative
this is a standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ve seen,negative
vampire hunter d is a gory gory film,negative
if they ever made a live version of the film it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx,negative
it s not that it s gore is unique it s just like other gory animes but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it s story characters animation etc,negative
it really didn t,negative
it was disgusting and gruesome which overshadowed the story what little of it there was,negative
it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies,negative
one evening a blond peasant girl drawn to look 17 and innocent a foreshadow that we will see her naked i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here,negative
of course he never put a no trespassing sign on his yard so one can t really blame her but he s upset anyway and demands retribution,negative
she gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren t there other places to get blood from,negative
it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough,negative
if its good enough for doctors to draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight,negative
to fight the spell she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is d,negative
the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much,negative
you see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he s a brooder who s sole purpose in life is to remain really really silent,negative
when he speaks it s in cliches,negative
heroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated,negative
later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire who wants to marry the peasant girl because he s bored after 10 000 years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time,negative
will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable,negative
in it s defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original,negative
the talking hand was clever and i think the inspiration for a skateboardrelated logo,negative
and that s the best defense i can think of,negative
i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans but i really don t see it,negative
it s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse to see animated breasts,negative
why,negative
what is the point of that,negative
maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny,negative
i m not a prude i just don t think it s warranted,negative
it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost,negative
is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower,negative
of course not it s done for shock,negative
it s tasteless and despicable,negative
jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today,negative
from timetotime she blows away audiences with powerful intense performances,negative
on the other hand this is the same woman who made her jawdroppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis king kong,negative
and much as lange would probably prefer moviegoers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it if only in quality,negative
hush is one such example,negative
lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasnt such a prime example of motion picture tedium,negative
the film opens as many socalled psychological thrillers do by posing as a light drama,negative
we are introduced to jackson johnathon schaech last encounter in tom hanks that thing you do and helen gwyneth paltrow a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love,negative
jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother martha lange,negative
the moment i first saw martha i started looking for fangs,negative
soon the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm,negative
once that goal is accomplished she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives,negative
as long as she gets her way martha is a perfectly amicable person but when helen defies her its a declaration of war,negative
hush has three very simple problems its incredibly dumb its incredibly boring and its incredibly predictable at least up to the stupefying ending,negative
this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snowcovered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrows bare buttocks,negative
frankly its embarrassing to watch a respected actress of langes stature give a performance like this its like a bad blanche dubois the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire,negative
meanwhile paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object,negative
as in all psychological thrillers the battle lines are clearly drawn,negative
here its mom and against wife with jackson caught in the middle,negative
of course since schaechs character is poorlydeveloped and badly acted its impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation,negative
maybe someone should ask him if hes familiar with oedipus,negative
martha is of course the evil one,negative
how do we know shes evil,negative
she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor two sure signs that the devil is at work,negative
on the other hand helen is a good girl,negative
the evidence for this is that shes nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents,negative
thats about it for character development,negative
beyond that point hush is just a series of increasingly hardtoswallow coincidences contrivances and moronic plot twists,negative
however the first 85 minutes are just a warmup for the ending which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying,negative
i cant imagine anyone no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole liking this conclusion,negative
either there was some serious lastminute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script,negative
before the climax i disliked hush by the time the end credits started i hated it,negative
viewers invest something in every movie they watch no matter how good or bad it is,negative
cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable,negative
most entries into this wornout wormeaten genre arent especially good,negative
films like consenting adults the hand that rocks the cradle and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along,negative
in general however theyre directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension,negative
thats not the case with really bad thrillers like this which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care,negative
indeed the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid,negative
synopsis sonny koufax adam sandler is a rich childish angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa kristy swanson,negative
in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin jon stewart and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian cole and dylan sprouse while kevin is on an overseas trip,negative
under sonnys supervision julian soon learns to lie to women tell people how he wipes his ass throw tantrums and scream for his god damned treats,negative
self centered julian breaks a school classmates arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong,negative
meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk food toys and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform,negative
not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonnys incompetent supervision and this leads to a custody battle,negative
opinion its a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior,negative
thats the essence of big daddy,negative
but theres a bigger issue involved marketing,negative
movies that are rated pg and pg13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below,negative
on tv film clips advertise these movies as familyfriendly hit comedies,negative
then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment,negative
folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation,negative
to many american mothers theres probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a womans ice cold tits,negative
ive always been a kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs great performances,negative
the minute i saw the trailer for this film i resolved to see it,negative
besides the fact that kline starred it looked like a hilarious film,negative
i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as i also thought wow if theres this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film,negative
oops i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multimultiplex,negative
the film began,negative
the film concerns an teacher at a suburban high school named howard brackett,negative
he loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played by matt dillon,negative
id put in his name but my wife wont let me take notes during a movie and ive forgotten it,negative
they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him,negative
brackett has been engaged to another teacher played by joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her,negative
the wedding however becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual,negative
kline spends most of the first twothirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isnt,negative
the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference,negative
his closest friends dont help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party,negative
there are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity,negative
kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations,negative
the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding,negative
kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows,negative
if you want to be surprised dont read i am going to reveal the ending,negative
instead of saying i do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says im gay,negative
this is where the movie in my opinion falls apart,negative
most of the humor in the film had come from klines insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being a senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy,negative
it reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live,negative
it was funny it was sustainably funny and klines performance made it doubly so,negative
however after the wedding the film drags on,negative
they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what hes done,negative
he reconciles with his parents and his friends some of which had turned on him,negative
there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time the scene with his mother and her friends which was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless,negative
finally even though i am not catholic i found the scene with the priest to be condescending,negative
the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming to brackett in the third person hes gay,negative
it got a chuckle from the audience but i was distracted by it and began to tire of the film,negative
by the time the wedding had come and gone i found myself hoping it would be over soon,negative
much like this review you are saying,negative
overall if i have to quantify it i say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets,negative
see it in economy time,negative
therere so many things to criticize about i dont know where to start,negative
recommendation turn off your brain dont be like me decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much,negative
a comet is about to strike earth causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event e l e that wiped out the dinosaurs,negative
what follows is the story of a presidents bid to think for the good of his people a rising reporter the love story of two teenagers one of whom discovered the comet and a team of astronauts on the ship messiah to save the world,negative
firstly there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film nor is there anything outstandingly good about it but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid,negative
to be honest i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself which isnt saying much,negative
mimi leders followup to the peacemaker is equally incompetent with all the big stars wasted,negative
perhaps im just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller the assignment,negative
it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives,negative
however the film simply fails on that note,negative
the effects are wornout the substandard screenplay limited the acting and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials,negative
shes still making good money though,negative
t a leonis unfortunate character the news reporter is the foundation of the story and of the cast,negative
but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored,negative
robert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless and morgan freemans president is restricted to well a righteous president which means hes not interesting at all,negative
leonis character is the only appealing one and is played with reasonable conviction but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters,negative
warning spoilers included but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway,negative
plot holes plot holes plot holes,negative
now e l e,negative
is threatening to exterminate more than 99 of the human race and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there,negative
wheres the logic,negative
leder could have at least made it plausible with 20,negative
and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish and those less selfish ones the ones that stayed at home were the victims,negative
the film was almost mocking them telling them they had died for nothing,negative
i also fail to see how two teenagers carrying a baby would be the first to climb up the even with a motorbike for a headstart,negative
its unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle but that doesnt really matter,negative
building caves was a strategy mentioned in dr,negative
strangelove which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years,negative
now that is a more practical use for caves,negative
what is the point of living in caves,negative
there is no unlike dr,negative
strangelove any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure,negative
how do plants grow,negative
if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves theres no reason why they cant do it in the open,negative
the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves,negative
obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago and you cant be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media,negative
in an important mission like that of the messiah for that matter any mission it is impossible that isnt sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres needless to say tens of kilometres,negative
this is not deep impact its a frivolous cheap impact,negative
but even with all that some overacting and a 3 4 rating its still watchable just dont think about it,negative
okay,negative
ironically one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life,negative
unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for a movie,negative
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldnt be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie,negative
not only is it a pathetically bad film overall but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,negative
the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles a home video,negative
it is december 31 1981 and the big party is at monicas martha plimpton house,negative
but no one has arrived yet,negative
her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups,negative
some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers,negative
but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before nights end,negative
those who are invited are the ones that have the issues,negative
it is up to those who arent to help them come to terms,negative
first there is eric brian mccardie who is a former boyfriend of monicas and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof,negative
he is one of the most bland characters in a film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical a common trait of this poor production,negative
bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new years eve and tag along to the party with them,negative
they stumble across a nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections,negative
he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school,negative
his lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch,negative
as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the substandard comedy,negative
moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts,negative
val is monicas cousin and a true fan of the new york scene,negative
on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just cant find,negative
paradoxically it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but arent successful who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds,negative
of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot,negative
wisely the movies creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless,negative
paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship,negative
however the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening,negative
finally there are the two worst performances and worst subplot of the film,negative
jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindys virginity the night before,negative
while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy,negative
very often when a film is as putrid as this production there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory,negative
however this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted,negative
instead what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies,negative
first and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot,negative
at other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot,negative
there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish,negative
not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver,negative
and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots,negative
perhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even a decent plot payoff at the end,negative
but it didnt happen that way,negative
the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight,negative
plot a separated glamorous hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together,negative
kewl now,negative
i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie,negative
critique trite unfunny boring and a waste of everyones talent,negative
how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesnt feature any chemistry any real laughs any surprises or any spice is beyond me,negative
how julia roberts is used solely as a puppy dog character puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zetajones character who is not one bit funny or romantic two ideal ingredients in a romantic comedy is also beyond me,negative
and why they chose john cusack a great quirky actor in his own right to play the most bland uninteresting and unfetching character with zero chemistry with either of his leads is further more beyond me,negative
and to anybody who decided that this project was funny enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above along with billy crystal christopher walker seth green and stanley tucci well,negative
what can i say i,negative
just dont have the words,negative
so is this the worst movie that ive seen all year,negative
no but it definitely sucks and its basically because well,negative
its just not funny,negative
and for the record allow me to state a few more problems with it,negative
it starts off slow its got no energy it doesnt engage you with any of its characters julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film everyone else lame it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward its utterly predictable standard routine seethrough and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen big and ugly waiting waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing,negative
and then hank azaria shows up aaaaaah the films savior mind you some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype but thats another story altogether,negative
but when an experienced voice actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer blockbuster romantic comedy with an overthetop antonio banderas accent damn dude your,negative
films in trouble,negative
rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself,negative
the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences huh the idioplot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax but everyone believes that hes going to kill himself hardyharhar and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ballsniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie well i,negative
could go on,negative
but i wont because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria green and tuccis antics from time to time ironic eh what,negative
about the leads dammit and liked the premise behind the film before i saw the finished product of course,negative
a dud all the way around,negative
btw all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds so when the scene finally came i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then well,negative
it basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit,negative
ugh,negative
i think im gonna start drinking again after this lameass movie,negative
cmon hollywood enough with the crud,negative

beautiful 110 my best friends wedding 710 notting hill 510 pretty woman 710 runaway bride 510 someone like you 410 wedding planner 310 when harry met sally 1010 youve got mail 410,negative
synopsis valerie a high school junior who doesnt look a day under 22 writes bad poetry complains about how much she hates school fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women chooses him as a pen pal and plays hooky to see him in court,negative
after a jailbreak the killer puts on big sunglasses wears a halfbuttoned jacket and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie,negative
comments alan smithee directed fatal charm which should have been more appropriately titled fatal bore or fatal crap,negative
if you find out that a film youre about to see is directed by alan smithee then you should seriously seriously seriously consider watching something anything else,negative
alan smithee is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad,negative
frankly id be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey so i think i understand why the director might have picked the alan smithee moniker for this film,negative
where to begin with this painfully poor thriller,negative
lets start with the acting,negative
its pretty bad,negative
amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent the rest of the cast dont even though her performance isnt exactly stellar material,negative
shes also miscast she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete,negative
her scenes with valeries mother played by mary frann are a joke,negative
the two look as though theyre a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesnt understand,negative
christopher atkins a handsome enough actor who plays the killer adam looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm,negative
trying to appear malicious and dangerous he wears large sunglasses and a halfbuttoned jacket,negative
if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead but he doesnt cut it here,negative
early on in the movie a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom,negative
outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film,negative
they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever,negative
fatal charms storyline such as it is inspires more yawns than thrills,negative
the script belabors a red herring early on about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam atkins is charged with,negative
this suspect however turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film an obvious plot fault,negative
even for the idiots who didnt consider the movies title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up,negative
so the audience must wait if they havent already stopped watching as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawnout finale,negative
the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an erotic thriller,negative
a thriller it isnt and neither is it particularly erotic,negative
i cant imagine if someone were in the mood for something erotic that hed be happy after watching this fluff,negative
a few erotic moments occur in the film they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus see theyre supposed to be valeries fantasies how creative,negative
on a personal note i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through,negative
its no wonder why she hated high school so much,negative
as an instructor of english myself i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature a teacher would stoop to reading a students bad poetry of course its valeries about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poems inspiration,negative
i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students,negative
fatal charm wont charm anyone unless theres someone thats charmed by boring lifeless insipid suspenseless thrillers,negative
if you happen upon this turkey just keep moving on,negative
wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions,negative
over black and white drawings we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiationinduced mutation,negative
the original inhabitants of the earth fairies and elves return to populate the globe along with their evil mutant counterparts,negative
one day and i say one day not to be trite but because thats exactly how it happened no advance notice a fairy queen gives birth to twins one good and one evil,negative
the twins grow up to be powerful wizards the good one embracing magic and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire,negative
we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology,negative
as unoriginal as the premise is i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out,negative
theres a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world after all,negative
i soon learned however that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film,negative
once the transition was made from still art to color animation an entirely different feel takes precedence,negative
rather than the epic saga promised by the narration we get a goofylooking world of a saturday morning cartoon,negative
not just the look mind you but all the zany sounds like honk boing,negative
for years blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined,negative
however blackwolf now has a secret weapon nazis,negative
yup adolf hitler the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht,negative
okay not the real things but an archival film his minions dug up,negative
projected into the sky for all to see it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up,negative
before you know it there are dead elves everywhere,negative
this is just as well,negative
the characters are so bad that the viewer doesnt care about any of them,negative
theyre either silly sappy or both,negative
the dialog gets much of the credit for this,negative
an example is when avatar nonchalantly says well looks like my brother and i begin our final battle,negative
not very formidable when hes also the guy who says this is the biggest bummer of a trip ive ever been on,negative
my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good cant fight back against the nazicharged evil,negative
her response is they have weapons and technology,negative
we just have love,negative
suffice to say the characters are strictly twodimensional and we therefore dont expect anything more than the obvious to happen,negative
which it does,negative
the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out which is anticlimactic and disappointing,negative
please note that it is the action that is unexpected,negative
that it is disappointing is not,negative
the film couldnt settle on a particular mood,negative
it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle,negative
scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity,negative
the dramatics which seem to occur at random are overly staged and overly acted detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned,negative
ralph bakshi the director makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film hitler and the nazis were bad,negative
so who doesnt know this already,negative
well maybe children,negative
okay so you might say that this is a movie for children,negative
its not,negative
in the scenes where good fights evil theres a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if theyre watching a cartoon,negative
so is the film for adults,negative
if so we probably dont need to be bashed over the head to get the point,negative
why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know,negative
wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes and hitler giving speeches,negative
however we dont see any reason why they should be considered bad,negative
we see no atrocities being committed not even any real battle footage,negative
there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich and were not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place,negative
this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment,negative
id like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere at any time and we must therefore be vigilant,negative
however im not sure if i want to give him that much credit,negative
yet another brainless teen flick this one is about surprise drugs and sex,negative
stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldnt look more bored,negative
their characters are cardboard cutouts of every cliched teenager out there,negative
one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie,negative
everything about it annoyed the hell out of me,negative
the acting and script the plot and ending,negative
the director of the fluke hit swingers could have very well directed a bunch of noname actors and had a watchabe film,negative
the big stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality,negative
i felt like i was watching dawsons creek episode 200,negative
although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast,negative
the surprise ending was sooo predictable,negative
since when is a male characters sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore,negative
go is dawsons creek varsity blues shes all that go home and watch something else,negative
as bad as mimic was it definitly scared me,negative
mimic continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie,negative
director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film cronos,negative
that movie worked because it took an unconventional story unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie,negative
in mimic del toro doesnt bother to give us anything original,negative
the plot is a stupid combination of aliens meets species meets jurassic park,negative
the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies,negative
theres nothing new in mimic,negative
its just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work,negative
at the end of the movie youre stuck wanting your money back,negative
maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies he forgot to turn the lights on,negative
i dont understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the seven trend and be set in dark dank areas,negative
watching mimic i was tempted several times to yell at the screen turn the lights on,negative
the switch is to your right,negative
use common sense,negative
just do it,negative
youll be able to see the monster in the corner,negative
theres a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off,negative
it looked like the light operator was having a seizure and sorvino didnt even notice she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts,negative
hmmm,negative
i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight,negative
mimic has a lot of incidental shock tactics boo,negative
just kidding and follows them up with the real scare but nothing in this movie scares you,negative
the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments i think they were bored too,negative
i shouldnt blame del toro,negative
he isnt the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie,negative
hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time the killer and hard boiled then came to america to make the stupid broken arrow,negative
french directors luc besson la femme nikita and george sluizer the vanishing followed woos lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies,negative
robert rodriguez who directed the terrific low budget el mariachi came to hollywood and directed the horrible highbudget desperado,negative
i dont know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country cant make a good american movie,negative
woo finally broke through and made but it still isnt up to par with his earlier films,negative
i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director welcome to america,negative
i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long,negative
do you speak english,negative
now i know you think youve made good movies in the past but now youre in america so things are a little different here,negative
just remember what the american audience always wants and youll be fine,negative
they want to see at least one big breasted woman characters that theyve seen a thousand times before because change scares americans and you always need a cheesy feelgood ending to wrap things up,negative
if you dont make that kind of movie youll be shining my shoes in no time,negative
a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 the phantom menace 20th century fox decides to release another space film that is a complete rip off of star wars,negative
what is the point of this,negative
i do not know but i wish it hadnt been done considering wing commander is definitely the years worst film so far,negative
to attract people to this horrible movie they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace,negative
wing commander will draw large crowds because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time,negative
the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight,negative
many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game,negative
i found this very interesting considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie,negative
it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though,negative
freddie prinze jr stars in the film as christopher blair,negative
wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie,negative
this was definitely his worst performance to date,negative
after januarys shes all that i actually saw a good actor in freddie but now all those visions have been crushed,negative
for now anyway,negative
christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi a group that is trying to destroy the earth,negative
blairs parents also fought in the space battles and also died there,negative
his parents were pilgrims so many people disrespect him because of this,negative
blair is under the command of angel played by saffron burrows and he is friends with another pilot todd maniac marshall played by matthew lillard,negative
matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie and he does in this one too,negative
his character as stu in 1996s scream a was a great one but now it seems like that same role is being played again only in a space movie,negative
the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth,negative
this plot is very flimsy and doesnt give a whole lot to work with at all,negative
this explains why wing commander drags on seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on,negative
the acting is horrible in wing commander,negative
many lines seem out of place and are completely meaningless,negative
the acting and dialogue was so terrible i even found myself laughing at it,negative
the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music,negative
the special effects are very unrealistic,negative
when looking at two ships flying side by side it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them,negative
the explosions look very unrealistic as well,negative
a ship will be blown up but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second,negative
this is very unrealistic,negative
music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time,negative
the music also felt like video game music and it was very corny and annoying sounding,negative
after we are given the plot the film repeats itself for another hour without any plot twists interesting scenes or anything important to the film,negative
blair is forced to make jumps over other planets and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft,negative
for the entire length of the movie it takes place in space,negative
it is truly like you are in a video game because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long extended period of time,negative
its not much fun to watch at all,negative
if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships i would go watch star wars at home,negative
at least star wars pays attention to people myth feelings and has some real plot to it,negative
the bottom line bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox,negative
the following review contains some harsh language,negative
but what did you expect when you clicked on this title,negative
cast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff b harmon written and directed by jeff b harmon running time 97 minutes,negative
the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside,negative
blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received a telegram from her exfiance,negative
isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith a resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson,negative
when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks a gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger,negative
instead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet,negative
april loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up,negative
mr and ms pfferpot director jeff b harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff b harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality,negative
in actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst to dick,negative
when april turns down dicks demand for her to return to bumfuck he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambostyle,negative
instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance alex boling and the two of them along with april and her lover blatz get married,negative
note to the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that im assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided,negative
aprils parents feeling like there is no recourse call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer their way,negative
the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the circuitry and they rewire it and send it back to washington d c destroying it,negative
mr and ms pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own,negative
im not sure if costar jeff b harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs,negative
either way he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie,negative
the film opens with a preacher running a small africanamerican child out of town and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan during a jaunty musical number preceded by remarks about gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews,negative
if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i cant help but feel like he had some serious intent,negative
as for the entire central theme of the movie im afraid that its one that i just dont get,negative
i tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes,negative
it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society,negative
how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of nonacceptance,negative
im not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but dont force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you arent going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me,negative
again maybe im missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully,negative
as far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy,negative
despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day,negative
speaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells aint ringing could have been a decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying,negative
im a lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith,negative
its mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based,negative
the other performers are decent save for the rosie odonnell like performance given by danica sheridan,negative
i have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired,negative
one particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my filmgoing life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan,negative
the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll,negative
the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented antinukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film,negative
once the isle of lesbos reprise was reached i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all,negative
why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end,negative
isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indieunderground com,negative
the transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 85 1,negative
in many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like a rocky horror for the new millennium,negative
this film is by no means my cup of tea but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it,negative
if you think it might be for you then by all means seek it out,negative
i on the other hand will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator,negative
wait arent gladiator films considered to be,negative
oh never mind,negative
godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who cares about plot summer movie,negative
a loose remake of the 1954 classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monsters which is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlins bigbudget lizardstompsmanhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind,negative
the script isnt just dumbed down its lobotomized,negative
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone,negative
presumably the primary target group for this film is teenage boys the demographic most likely to shell out 7 repeatedly to see the same images of monsterinstigated carnage,negative
thats not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction theyre just not as readily susceptible,negative
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computergenerated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors,negative
stargate was a financial success,negative
independence day was a runaway hit,negative
and with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tieins before it even opens its virtually guaranteed at least 100 million,negative
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a nottooprecocious grade school kid,negative
godzilla isnt completely without merit although it is close,negative
theres a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wears off quickly,negative
frankly while the special effects are competent theyre not all that stunning,negative
theres nothing new here its jurassic park meets aliens with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure,negative
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computergenerated visuals to the next level,negative
godzilla never really pushes the envelope preferring to remain within a comfort zone,negative
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity,negative
how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival,negative
worst of all godzilla isnt even exciting,negative
with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isnt a sequence in this film that raises the pulse,negative
even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawnprovoking,negative
independence day may have been dumb but it was full of adrenaline moments capable of getting the audience involved in the action,negative
in this aspect of its production as in so many others godzilla is lacking,negative
actually part of the problem is that were never sure who were supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paperthin humans trying to stop him,negative
the plot such as it is can be summed up rather simply,negative
after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands godzilla shows up in the big apple,negative
he does some of the usual tourist things stops by madison square garden visits the chrysler building goes on a walk through central park and takes the subway,negative
in the process he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs but he never has trouble with traffic jams,negative
on hand to stop him is an elite u s army unit led by a slightly lessarrogantthanusual military man kevin dunn and a biologist named nick tatopoulos who has a theory about godzilla,negative
in his opinion the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific,negative
in nicks words godzilla is a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind,negative
as luck would have it nicks old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is a reporter based at a new york tv station,negative
along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla,negative
then just when the military has rejected nicks theory about why godzilla is in new york a member of the french secret service jean reno recruits him for a special assignment,negative
instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla has chosen new york city,negative
unfortunately manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon that its becoming boring,negative
the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall,negative
he could climb the empire state building,negative
at ten times that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over,negative
godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor,negative
theres an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sitcom material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nicks last name properly and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel,negative
both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager,negative
eberts reelection slogan is not surprisingly thumbs up for new york,negative
the stuff is amusing the first time its used but after a while it grows tiresome,negative
and although the characters dont serve any real purpose they keep popping up,negative
godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast,negative
this is largely because emmerich doesnt want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard,negative
thats not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno arent capable of good performances both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they arent alist names,negative
then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine,negative
maria pitillo dear god plays the love interest and hank azaria great expectations is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief,negative
ultimately it doesnt really matter what i or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie,negative
tristar has assumed that godzilla like all selfproclaimed summer event motion pictures is pretty much criticproof,negative
it may also be wordofmouthproof,negative
those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say,negative
so when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time its like spitting into the wind,negative
emmerich and devlin are master illusionists waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors,negative
its probably too much to hope that some day moviegoers will wake up and realize that theyve been had,negative
capsule the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension,negative
alien 3 the 3 should be in superscript is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen,negative
it continues the story of ripley the spacetruckerturnedimpromptusurvivalist but seems remarkably uninterested in her,negative
in fact the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all its so elegaic and limp,negative
a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning,negative
at the end of the last film aliens ripley and two survivors were on their way home,negative
unfortunately an alien pod had been deposited in their ship and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod,negative
the pod crashes on firorina 161 a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent,negative
ripley lives through the crash the others do not,negative
the prison is a grim place even as prisons go its been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks which provides no end of technogothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against,negative
lice are endemic and so ripleys head is shaved another surreal touch,negative
at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive but it doesnt stay that way,negative
one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches and soon a newlygestated alien is running amuck,negative
worse it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated,negative
whats weird is how little tension this generates except near the end when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable loud music shaky camerawork etc sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role and she does well with it but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack,negative
the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do the doctor charles dance and another rather religious inmate charles s dutton very good hiave presence but theyre not asked to do anything with it,negative
in light of the impending sequel which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie i will not talk about the ending except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie,negative
its strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldnt have driven the rest of it,negative
aspiring broadway composer robert aaron williams secretly carries a torch for his best friend struggling actor marc michael shawn lucas,negative
the problem is marc only has eyes for perfect 10s which the geeky insecure robert certainly is not,negative
meanwhile marcs spoiled hetero female roommate cynthia mara hobel spends her days lying about their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown,negative
writerdirector victor mignattis very romantic comedy as the ad campaign states is supposed to be pardon the pun a gay ol romp but its hard to have much fun with these annoying selfabsorbed characters and their shallow personal problems marc and cynthia have sitcomlevel domestic crises such as trying to kill bugshow hilarious robert and marc go to acting class how riveting the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges how original,negative
but more than anything else the three whine,negative
constantly,negative
marc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent 10 david hugh panaro the hunky musician from across the way robert whines about not being able to find the right guy cynthia whines about having to find a job horrors,negative
the terrible trio whine their way to a happy ending that is wholly undeserved,negative
add in overly broad performances and some laughable lipsynching by panaro and youre left with one astonishing piece of cinematic damage,negative
i have always been a fan of director neil jordan from his early work such as 1984s the company of wolves to 1992s the crying game and 1994s interview with a vampire,negative
his latest film the butcher boy is a return to his roots in ireland but unfortunately it is not a successful homecoming,negative
told through the eyes of a 12yearold irish boy francis newcomer eomann owens this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life,negative
his father stephen rea is an indifferent alcoholic his mother fiona shaw is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore,negative
francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic even capable of brutal murder,negative
the premise of the butcher boy is one that could have very well been turned into a thoughtprovoking disturbing motion picture but somehow nothing works,negative
francis is in almost every scene but we learn very little about him as if the film was distancing itself away from him when i suspect we were actually supposed to sympathize with him,negative
this is definately not young owens fault however because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance and is able to also seem menacing as well,negative
the fact that we dont get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay,negative
the supporting characters are no help though,negative
rea is wasted and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son or to anyone else for that matter,negative
he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout,negative
shaw has a little bit more to work with since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her,negative
and singer sinead oconnor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice,negative
the pacing is all off in the butcher boy,negative
although the story could have been dynamite it moves at a deadeningly slow rate and i found my mind wandering every once in a while,negative
it is also very episodic because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs,negative
at one point francis is sent away to a juvenile prison and an odd possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself but nothing comes of it,negative
id rather think of the butcher boy as a brief diversion for director jordan rather than a total misfire,negative
he has already proven to be a strong director but he lucked out with this latest film,negative
what could have been a courageous unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy only manages to be an ineffective uninvolivng bore,negative
its not a bad thing to update old stories,negative
its done all the time in the oral tradition,negative
the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed its that its dry,negative
the new cinderella danielle drew barrymore is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come,negative
shes a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france,negative
when her father dies she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla anjelica huston,negative
she works by day but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night,negative
although the story is updated you know the plot,negative
danielle meets prince henry dougray scott goes to a ball disguised is later found out and they live happily ever after,negative
the movie is often like watching a filmed play,negative
theater in real life is engrossing,negative
theater on the screen is usually lifeless,negative
there doesnt seem to be much going on,negative
the camera can be a star of films,negative
here its a coconspirator,negative
danielles convictions are compromised,negative
a socialist and a feminist she pretends to be royalty to get her man,negative
a kind woman her last act in the movie is one of revenge,negative
the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish,negative
the fairy godmother standin leonardo da vinci patrick godfrey is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle,negative
huston is enjoyable in her overthetop wickedness,negative
in all fairness my companion loved the film,negative
maybe its one of those chick flicks that men dont like,negative
it is certainly a date film,negative
nearly the entire audience was couples,negative
oh well maybe its good for something,negative
i didnt come into city of angels expecting greatness,negative
ive never seen wim wenders wings of desire the classic movie upon which city is loosely based,negative
then again i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device with the little mermaid both the disney version and the original folktale being among them that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold,negative
unfortunately city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them,negative
the plot for those that couldnt tell from the previews revolves around the angel seth played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage who in the midst of his angelic duties falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally,negative
of course his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her watch her buy groceries only to disappear in the blink of an eye,negative
their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human,negative
using this framework as a jumpingoff point the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire the joys of being human and the definition of perfection,negative
the first half of the movie succeeds on most points,negative
cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesnt know feelings so cant really express preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hangdog expressions,negative
unfortunately cage takes the intensity too far sometimes and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive,negative
as maggie ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right,negative
her beauty unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss is mature intelligent and winning,negative
likewise some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film,negative
when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel,negative
the beautiful camera work shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel,negative
the film begins to lose its way though when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie,negative
the grand angelic perspective gets lost except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angels eyes,negative
the movie devolves into an examination of how seth cant feel the world or more importantly he cant feel maggie he cant smell her hair feel her touch or taste the pears she eats,negative
this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seths intense longing but in doing so the conflict disappears,negative
if he wants maggie so badly then why doesnt her just make the leap and become human,negative
after all whats so great about being an angel,negative
sure you get to sit on marlboro signs but whats that compared to getting to be with meg ryan,negative
and from there once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur its all downhill,negative
the philosophy becomes heavyhanded the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audiences hankie,negative
its the last thirty minutes of the movie then that wrecks the film,negative
i feel like the writer by pulling out all the melodramatic stops has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level,negative
i came out feeling robbed seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing,negative
i could go on longer but i dont want to ruin the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on,negative
city of angels then is a paradox,negative
its a wellacted particularly look for dennis franz cutting against typecasting as a happygolucky fallen angel wellfilmed and based on a wonderful idea,negative
all these possibilities though are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up,negative
gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the films end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer,negative
nobody can save this bomb from its own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religioustype of film,negative
its just a pile of dreck an,negative
illconceived exploitive project a pyrotechnical film,negative
end of days aims to be an apocalyptic thriller,negative
it features an idiotic script a hack director and a onedimensional star who is past his prime which,negative
makes this film dumber than dumb plus its not funny not campy or is it in the least bit entertaining,negative
its just dreary and unwatchable a,negative
bigbudget slasher film,negative
arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan occupying gabriel byrnes body and possessing a wall st bank account from destroying the world,negative
the film opens in vatican city roma 1979 where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by who proclaims after looking at his scrolls thats the sign for the eye of god which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satans baby the antichrist in the hour before the new century begins when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth,negative
tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom,negative
but some in the popes circle want to kill her if found even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live as he lectures them even in the worlds darkest days doing evil doesnt stop evil but brings on more evil,negative
we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 which seems to be the logical place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries,negative
the chosen woman is christine york robin,negative
it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wisecracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest thomas aquinas arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot,negative
he nevertheless can speak and tells arnold an end of days is coming as prophesized in revelations,negative
but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of the end of the world on his body,negative
it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman,negative
he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues people jumping out of windows satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnolds partner as the piss explodes like gasoline satan being fired at resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it,negative
there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs including the subway churches and luxury buildings,negative
the only trouble with all these highbudget action sequences was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value,negative
the story was so terrible and inaccurate that it did not have an iota of value or credibility,negative
mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000,negative
why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devils number 666 well,negative
satans numeral is actually 999 which is upside down of 666,negative
accordingly you just put a 1 in front of it and bingo you get 1999,negative
with logic like that this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewers eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult,negative
this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film,negative
i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose,negative
movies dont come much more ridiculously titled than i still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as a warning,negative
more than a sillysounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor this horror sequels moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot what you did last summer you actually did the summer before last summer and since i knew about it this summer as well as last summer its really illogical to say that i still know what you did last summer,negative
the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter i still know the longer i still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked to bits,negative
that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart,negative
for example if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress,negative
probably not but thats precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does to best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights,negative
julie youll recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997s surprise hit i know what you did last summer after a slasher with a grudge to bear its a long story began trying to pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village,negative
in this installment the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas and julie yet racked by guilt decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind,negative
yeah right,negative
their island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the stillalive killer muse watson from the first film,negative
he sports the same gortons fisherman getup a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why hes still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves,negative
though i suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit,negative
in a sense thats the movies glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel,negative
the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary but trey callaways derivative i still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims,negative
when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do,negative
he twistties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays youd think hed want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later,negative
even prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh,negative
the innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into i know s unfolding story is sorely missed replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo youll cheer not shriek when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest,negative
if i know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly i still know what you did last summer deserves a fullblown roasting on mystery science theatre 3000,negative
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting,negative
one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is,negative
this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and i mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman,negative
hitting the road with her hick guitarplaying boyfriend in a rustedout gm novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby due in a month,negative
stopping off at a nearby walmart for a quick rest novalees boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there,negative
novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the walmart because shes not the brightest bulb in the stagelights,negative
a wacky librarian keith david comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store,negative
then the she moves in with a family befriends everyone in town including ashley judds character who has five kids and still can work parttime as a nurse fights off religious freaks survives a tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds a martha stewartesque house becomes an awardwinning photographer and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything with her kid,negative
this film is terrible,negative
the directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again,negative
we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman who can do good work,negative
a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off,negative
a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the walmart parking lot,negative
an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters making the audience ill,negative
taking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them to write drama on par with oprahs book club,negative
altogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching a very bad television miniseries and wishing it to end only the remote is broken,negative
however the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart,negative
no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk,negative
old soldiers never die they just turn into cliches,negative
soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman,negative
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body,negative
jungian archetypes these two opposites need each other to create a whole but its difficult to integrate both,negative
often well encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and with the help of jungs magician sit around imagining grand schemes,negative
without the drive to manifest their plans much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness all they have are dreams,negative
warriors on the other hand are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat and will do combat with every last bit of their energy,negative
they dont care enough about anything to know whats worth fighting for gladiators who live only for the battle,negative
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know but can also illustrate societies,negative
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers,negative
todd 3465 kurt russell is a living breathing archetype,negative
chosen from birth as a soldier he is raised by the government to be a killing machine,negative
his childhood is cruelty and competition,negative
he is indoctrinated with the big rules,negative
never question authority,negative
winning is everything,negative
strength beats knowledge,negative
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars todd is 40 and hes obsolete,negative
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger,negative
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers caine 607 jason scott lee hes unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 a garbage world,negative
obviously our hero is still alive,negative
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health,negative
when the peaceloving colonists get a good look at who todd is they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world,negative
they are the other good guys,negative
these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons,negative
todd finds himself in the role of protector,negative
what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultraright wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon,negative
the effects are mostly secondrate explosions or jerky slow motion,negative
the plot is old hat,negative
we dont get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers,negative
hardly anything makes sense,negative
the films science fares badly,negative
with all the remarkable advances weve made in just 37 years the film takes place in 2036 were still stupid,negative
after conquering the stars for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away,negative
even stranger the garbage barges appear to double as time machines,negative
virtually all the trash is vintage 1960,negative
there is nothing in the story that is not predictable,negative
the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra connie nielsen the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him,negative
it doesnt take a genius to foresee that her husband isnt going to be around much longer,negative
is it a shock to find out that the films climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine,negative
who would you guess wins,negative
some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy,negative
todds first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connies nipple poking through her thin blouse,negative
later as he sits by his lonely campfire a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion,negative
supposedly this clich isnt meant to be humorous,negative
dastardly col mekum jason isaacs with a pencilthin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash,negative
responsible for last years quirky and visually enticing but problematic the fifth element director paul anderson sees the film as shane in outer space,negative
maybe if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode,negative
the movie doesnt even work as an action film,negative
there is never a question as to the outcome,negative
somehow the new superior soldiers dont prove much of a match for todd,negative
the acting isnt anything to write home about,negative
nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim,negative
russell is buffedup and does a credible job but its not much of a challenge,negative
uttering around 100 words during the film mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space,negative
gary busey as todds commanding officer is completely wasted in his lowkey role,negative
everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool,negative
sometimes the sets are impressive,negative
unfortunately occasionally and sometimes dont make a film,negative
most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote blade runner possibly the best science fiction movie ever made,negative
sharpeyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film,negative
peoples says that this is not a blade runner sequel but a sidequel that takes place in the same universe,negative
although that may have been the intent in his original script the result is more like a bad television series that the blade runner replicants watch to pass time,negative
perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining,negative
michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and wants to wish everyone an appropriate halloween whatever,negative
youd like it to be,negative
i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas,negative
with the overt success of the three original star wars films lucas has become not necessarily a filmmaker but the head cheeze at a huge toy company with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve,negative
only this toy was made for 115 million but every kid wants it and like all other expensive toys falls apart within an hour after playing with it,negative
the product in question star wars episode 1 the phantom menace jeez is pure and simple its about the money baby,negative
no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldnt make a ton of money before its fourth week of release,negative
i come to the sw franchise as a stranger since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular,negative
i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy,negative
phantom menace is like the first sw minus 10,negative
nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable,negative
even the special effects seem rather bland,negative
the story in this new one is a mindless mess the,negative
acting wooden and the action sequences like something out of a video game,negative
sw phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far,negative
with a title like sw e1 tpm lucas has one big head on those shoulders,negative
i thought chris carter did for releasing an xfiles movie although that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours,negative
pm is one long headache,negative
the happy bastards quick movie review,negative
holy man,negative
more like holy crap,negative
the film stars eddie murphy as a mysticalish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs jeff goldblum and kelly preston with a flat tire on their hands,negative
somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel a lineup of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white morgan fairchild and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures,negative
its here that he seems to hit his stride speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales,negative
at this point in the movie of course morality comes into play particularly on goldblum who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss robert loggia,negative
it doesnt take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points,negative
only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchilds face seems to have any interest in the movie,negative
murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if hed rather be someplace else,negative
some may argue that the movie has a message but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat,negative
at least he has something for us to laught at,negative
as far as mystery men is concerned the burning question is less is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer,negative
the answer there is an unequivocal yes and more how in the name of sweet jesus did firsttime director kinka usher get such a firstrate cast to act in this muck,negative
mystery men features greg kinnear as the heavilysponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis singular casanova frankenstein,negative
a veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title who join forces to get c amazing out of a tight spot when c frankenstein puts the screws on champion city,negative
theres william h macy as the mildmannered shoveler hank azaria as the cutleryflinging blue raja no knives but a phony english accent thats just as sharp ben stiller as mr furious whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar janeane garofalo as a crazed bowler with her fathers skull interestingly preserved wes studi as a rhetoricspouting cowled avenger and kel mitchell as the token and adding insult to injury invisible,negative
black guy,negative
bringing up the rear so to speak is paul reubens yes thats pee wee herman paul reubens as,negative
well lets just call him the gas man,negative
the production design is overblown the special effects are overdone and the script based on bob burdens dark horse comic book series is overbaked,negative
the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar but they cant begin to save mystery men its just one big mess,negative
youre better off renting the video and pressing fastforward to get to the funny bits,negative
i believe i counted three,negative
there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do,negative
i delighted in the sneakysmart entertainment of ron underwoods bigundergroundworm yarn tremors i even giggled at last years criticallysavaged bigunderwatersnake yarn anaconda,negative
something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth spent in the company of ghidrah the creature from the black lagoon and the blob,negative
deep rising a bigunderseaserpent yarn doesnt quite pass the test,negative
sure enough all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place a conspicuously multi national collection of bait excuse,negative
me characters an isolated location here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea some comic relief a few cgienhanced grossouts and at least one big explosion,negative
there are toocheesytobeaccidental elements like a sleazy shipping magnate anthony heald who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology or a slinky international jewel thief famke janssen whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold,negative
as it happens deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients,negative
a terrorist crew led by squintyeyed mercenary hanover wes studi and piloted by squintyeyed boat captain finnegan treat williams shows up to loot the cruise ship the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew a few survivors make it to the closing credits,negative
and up go the lights,negative
its hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless filmmaking especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream,negative
here the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j oconnor generally amusing as the crews fraidycat mechanic,negative
stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of actionhorror menace something overpopulated with goredrenched skeletons something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously,negative
deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that were expected to have a ridiculous good time not hide our eyes,negative
case it point comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda,negative
in deep rising one of the creatures victims is regurgitated back into view partially digested and still alive,negative
he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable,negative
in anaconda we also see a regurgitated victim partially digested and still alive,negative
he looks at another character and,negative
winks,negative
make no mistake deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing,negative
its also gloomy uninspired and not nearly enough fun,negative
i dont ask much of my monster movies but i do ask that they act like monster movies,negative
you dont have to show me a fantastically impressive massive beast with tentacles aflailing,negative
just show me the massive beast burping and ill figure you get the point,negative
starring shawnee smith donovan leitch ricky paull goldin kevin dillon billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960s classic a term that i use very loosely to define the original about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way,negative
now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel,negative
the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesnt exactly hurt it either,negative
fast forward to the late 80s,negative
steve mcqueen isnt in the remake this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years,negative
nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role,negative
that is unless you count matt dillons brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter,negative
the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original,negative
the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets,negative
it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets,negative
the special effects in this movie are cheesy like the originals,negative
unlike the original they dont look campy they just look cheap,negative
one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith,negative
she is very attractive and can actually act which is more than i can say about some of her costars,negative
in terms of plot a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky,negative
seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite,negative
anyway the pink stuff has a taste for humans,negative
the more people it absorbs the bigger it gets,negative
and it isnt the friendliest goop on the block either,negative
anyway it attacks this little town and its up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it,negative
not really but that is how it seems,negative
this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original,negative
as ive already said this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap badly acted and badly written than campy,negative
in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness,negative
although star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon,negative
the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple they all stunk out loud,negative
although some of the films smaller roles are filled with some actors that while not big stars are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows,negative
it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible,negative
sadly it doesnt work very well,negative
if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original,negative
although that isnt so hot either,negative
this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities,negative
one would think that david duchovny star of the cult favorite xfiles would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles,negative
at least one would hope so,negative
one would be seriously incorrect,negative
eugene sands duchovny is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more,negative
it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence,negative
ten months later in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer,negative
using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing sands operates and saves his life,negative
smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom timothy hutton is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate,negative
he kidnaps and then offers downandout eugene a position in his organization,negative
blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital,negative
sands temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangsters womanfriend claire angelina jolie this films babe factor,negative
the wouldbe big time operator is desperately in need of help,negative
on the run from russian mobsters the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this years films and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia blossom is surrounded by blood,negative
after a few medical misadventures the physician grows disenchanted with his employment,negative
an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he fixes their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work,negative
when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else,negative
oddly enough these seem like they could be exciting scenes,negative
the film disproves that assumption,negative
then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen,negative
writing this only two days after seeing the film its a struggle to remember the events,negative
you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation,negative
for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in xfiles its a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma,negative
the doctor is particularly bland and dull,negative
even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal,negative
a little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal,negative
like virtually everything else in the film its a missed opportunity,negative
the fox mulder detachment doesnt work here,negative
oscarwinner huttons manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on,negative
played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer blossom almost becomes real but then sinks into goofiness,negative
most of the time hutton looks as if hes searching for his character and coming up empty,negative
jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a threedimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery,negative
the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen,negative
the rest arent any better,negative
michael massees eccentric fbi agent never revs up,negative
one of blossoms henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmers doc holliday in tombstone,negative
his twogunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film,negative
but that 15 seconds isnt worth sitting through the other 90 minutes,negative
first time film director andy wilson known for his work on the british television series cracker appears to be attempting to jump on the pulp fiction bandwagon,negative
the best of these movies combine a sense of style and flash with significant substance,negative
the secondrate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects,negative
playing god does neither well,negative
the basic idea of the film is solid,negative
and then it goes nowhere,negative
even worse it plods back and forth up and down a long and winding road before it ends up nowhere,negative
fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life,negative
susan grangers review of the musketeer universal pictures,negative
hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this 50 million adaptation of alexandre dumass novel thats strong on action but weak on drama fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay,negative
the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing dartagnan justin chambers as he leaves his village of gascogne headed for paris to join king louis xiiis elite guard the royal musketeers and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier,negative
this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre tim roth vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu stephen rea,negative
the traditional musketeer trio aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steve speirs dont offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca mena suvari chambermaid to the queen of france catherine deneuve,negative
scripter gene quintano and directorcinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derringdo as evidenced by choreographer xinxin xiongs elaborate but not original stunts including a fastpaced stagecoach chase a tavern brawl on rolling barrels highwire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes and a ladderfight sequence,negative
filmed in southern france the scenery sets and costumes are spectacular but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy restless mtvish cuts,negative
as the swashbuckling dartagnan bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing totally lacking onscreen charisma not to mention acting skill,negative
mena suvari so impressive in american beauty seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 the musketeer is a cinematic but shallow 3,negative
all for one and one for all,negative
not this time round,negative
when i arrived in paris in june 1992 i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks fire walk with me since the movie wasnt scheduled to open in the u s until late august,negative
happily the filmthe prequel to david lynchs cult television serieswas playing in a fancy thx theater,negative
unfortunately the theater was far more impressive than the movie which absolutely stinks much like a french lavatory,negative
worse actually,negative
fire walk with me directed by lynch will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read laura palmers secret diary,negative
for twin peaks junkies like me the movie is only marginally improved,negative
the plot is jumbled and illogical not to mention excruciatingly sluggish,negative
the first 30 minutes which have almost nothing to do with the main story line feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland oregon,negative
the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper,negative
lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks washingtonone year later,negative
ah twin peaks familiar territory you think to yourself as angelo badalamentis distinctive musical score chimes in,negative
wrong,negative
the movie proves that you really cant go home again or at least lynch cant,negative
only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie leland palmer bobby briggs james shelly leo the log lady and a few othersmostly in meaningless cameos,negative
the rest of the twin peaks cast is nowhere to be seen and consequently lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tvs most enigmatic town,negative
cast members michael ontkean sherilyn fenn piper laurie and richard beymer are sorely missed not to mention lara flynn boyle who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna,negative
the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer sheryl lee as she suffers through drug abuse prostitution and incest during her miserable last seven days on earth,negative
the night of lauras death which is truly terrifying is the films only remotely effective sequence,negative
we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere,negative
her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series which is gratifying for faithful twin peaks viewers,negative
but its an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie,negative
im really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone,negative
sure she is one of the most beautiful creatures on gods green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in she always strikes out,negative
the crush was a slowmoving predictable piece of fluff,negative
hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in,negative
clueless was an annoying unfunny waste of time,negative
and people have emailed me too saying clueless is a good movie and that im the only one who doesnt like it,negative
one girl said if id seen the movie with an open mind i would have enjoyed it,negative
nothing could be further from the truth,negative
i went into the theater expecting to love the movie,negative
the preview looked good and of course im crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny unlikable characters,negative
almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way,negative
when we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasnt me yelled out that was the worst fin movie ive ever seen and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement,negative
so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicias pretty face on the cover of some madeforvideo thriller called the babysitter,negative
i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ill probably never understand made me rent it anyway,negative
what i got was 90 minutes of regretthe worst alicia silverstone movie ever,negative
and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like,negative
where to begin in criticizing this movie,negative
the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it was by a ten year old alicia is the star and shes still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever,negative
there is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minutes when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence,negative
zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero,negative
so why does this movie get one star out of me,negative
well alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub,negative
and if it wasnt bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four star features but you settle for what you can get,negative
alicia plays a babysitter whos spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party,negative
and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home at least that movie critic at large guy does,negative
as the movie trods along we discover shes not only the mostlysilent star of the movie but also the object of every male characters fantasies and probably every male viewers too,negative
the drunken father thinks shes just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while shes taking her bubble bath,negative
they even throw in the middle aged wifes fantasies about a male counterpart at the party,negative
not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200 pound woman in a black silk teddy,negative
at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pgrated,negative
in fact i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax latenight staple if not for the fact that theres absolutely no nudity in it,negative
so you cant call it a sex flick,negative
ive already pointed out that it cant fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter as,negative
bad,negative
joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory,negative
the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it,negative
it has a solid cast with tom hanks meg ryan as the lead roles,negative
but you can never judge a movie by its cast,negative
if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano it is that the plot is original,negative
unfortunately it is also incredibly stupid,negative
the movie begins with joe tom hanks going to work,negative
this opening sequence is very boring and slow,negative
it shows joe walking to his office,negative
but on the way he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting,negative
a sequence like this should take 2 minutes,negative
here it takes over 5,negative
it is obvious that joe hates his job,negative
at his office one of his coworkers is meg ryan,negative
oddly enough she plays 3 different roles in this movie,negative
joe leaves to go to a doctors appointment,negative
his doctor informs him that he has a brain cloud,negative
this means that in a few months he will die,negative
so what does joe do,negative
quit his job of course,negative
when he arrives home joe meets an old man named graynamore lloyd bridges,negative
graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god,negative
by a startling coincidence the boat trip to the island takes a few months,negative
by the time he reaches the island he will almost be dead from the brain cloud anyway so joe agrees,negative
graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this great adventure,negative
joe goes on a date with meg ryan his coworker,negative
the day before the boat trip joe meets one of graynamores daughters,negative
she is also surprise meg ryan,negative
except she looks more hippyish,negative
they both have dinner and the next day joe gets driven over to his boat,negative
the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamores daughters,negative
and wonder of wonders she is also played by meg ryan,negative
as they sail to the island meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda,negative
after some stupid talking scenes they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to,negative
and that the brain cloud thing was made up,negative
they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage,negative
joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark,negative
this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times,negative
but to top it off the shark is obviously rubber and fake,negative
one night there is a storm,negative
a cheaplooking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard,negative
fortunately joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail,negative
by pure luck they get to the island,negative
since the natives like orange soda they wear soda cans as attire,negative
stupid or what,negative
before joe leaps in the volcano he gets fed,negative
right before he jumps meg ryan pleads him not to,negative
when joe decides to she goes in with him because she loves him,negative
now this is where the movie should end,negative
but unfortunately the cheesy ending bug comes in,negative
the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joes luggage,negative
they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers,negative
i give this movie a,negative
see it only if youre a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan,negative
reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy analyze this i asked myself how could this miss,negative
robert de niro taxi driver raging bull billy crystal city slickers lisa kudrow the opposite of sex and director harold ramis national lampoons vacation,negative
these are usually reliable filmmakers well okay crystal has been in a sizable slump lately and tellingly the first halfhour of analyze this was very funny,negative
unfortunately as the running time ticked away i began to think that the first thirty minutes had unbeknownst to me been rewound and were being replayed another twoandahalf times,negative
the film has obtained a clever premise but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen,negative
middleaged psychoanalyst ben sobels billy crystal life is finally going very well,negative
although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents especially his father who is also a psychiatrist ben has an easygoing teenage son kyle sabihy and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend laura lisa kudrow,negative
in little but a flash however ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti robert de niro who desperately wants counseling even though he himself wont even admit to having anxiety attacks,negative
ben tries to help paul mostly so he will get him off his back but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death,negative
it seems to ben that no matter what he does paul vitti will not go away and the more they become involved the more bens potentially happy life gets into danger,negative
analyze this has a few laughs sprinkled throughout mostly in the first half but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan ramis and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106minute running time,negative
admittedly de niro is very funny here and i cant remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him and crystal is in topform but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them including a substantial plotline,negative
since analyze this bills not one not two but three writers youd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws but they must have all been on autopilot,negative
one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters all of which have next to nothing to do and arent even given multidimensional characters to attempt to develop,negative
coming off of her oscarcaliber work in two of last years best films clockwatchers and the opposite of sex lisa kudrows throwaway girlfriend role is an incredible step down,negative
sure kudrows fellow friend jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in office space but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston,negative
kudrow meanwhile mostly just stands around no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place,negative
chazz palminteri as rival gangster primo fares even worse in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character,negative
finally molly shannon rising film star and cast member on saturday night live has a rousingly hilarious onescene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystals patients and then completely disappears,negative
too bad considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal,negative
once analyze this approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrows laura standing alone at the altar once again i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most ben,negative
afterwards the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul became a real laughfree deadzone losing its last remaining comic punches,negative
analyze this proves that talent can certainly help any film out but when the written material isnt up to their level what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air,negative
with all that education you should know what happiness is,negative
starring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsuehwei directed by edward yang written by yang and wu nienchen cinematography by christopher doyle and chang huikung,negative
every country has eventually its new wave,negative
france had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on,negative
some waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us with the balm of discovery,negative
taiwans new wave came in the 1980s in the work of directors like hou hsiaohsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beachyangs first featureis central,negative
it created a new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering,negative
later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan a distinctive international presence,negative
that day itself is long and frustrating the document of a nations attempt to find a voice,negative
it does not lack ambition,negative
it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized whitecollar middleclass feel as their lives are shaped by oldfashioned rolesdedicated career men loyal housewivesthat they find unfulfilling,negative
jiali sylvia chang is the focus but the film brings others into its compassher husband her brother friends from her college daysas it charts her discontents,negative
no one is happy,negative
jiali married her husband welei at a young age,negative
at the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jialis marriage seemed in comparison a good one she chose welei of her own free will they loved each other,negative
but it goes wrong,negative
that day dutifully presents all the clich s welei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair with a coworker jiali feels restless and trapped bound by a choice she made while young but which no longer seems wise,negative
the film never redeems these clich s by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured,negative
it unfolds awkwardly as a series of flashbacks told during a luncheon in vienna where jiali meets her brothers old flame teresa hu now a concert pianist whom she has not seen since college,negative
both women seem rather sad and resigned to their sadness,negative
their circumstances and those of jialis brother and a college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choicesmarried the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate,negative
it is not that jiali married the wrong man she didnt,negative
the problem is that she needed to marry at alland that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy,negative
for a woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins,negative
the films sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan,negative
seen now it does not seem provocative,negative
indeed its hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull,negative
and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined,negative
nor does he bring anything newother than the localeto the material,negative
there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives forin a young couples first kiss in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husbands mistressbut they are brief,negative
too often yang devotes needless time to mundane scenesgrocery shopping flowerarrangingin which nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted,negative
perhaps if the film were content to focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating,negative
but jiali and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties,negative
at two hours and fortyfive minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently longwinded,negative
consider the defining moment for jiali the titular day on the beach,negative
the thrust of the whole film explains easily enough what we are to think of that moment what it means when she walks away from a particular situation,negative
even so the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point,negative
needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout,negative
the look of the film is as tedious as the drawnout narrative,negative
it was the first feature shot by christopher doyleat least its his name in the creditswho is now rightly regarded as one of the worlds leading cinematographers,negative
in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong karwai he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image,negative
you would never know it from watching that day which due either to doyles inexperience or yangs humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible,negative
in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak,negative
steve martin is one of the funniest men alive,negative
if you can take that as a true statement then your disappointment at this film will equal mine,negative
martin can be hilarious creating some of the best laughoutloud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters,negative
you wont find any of them here,negative
the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit,negative
bilko and the name isnt an accident is the head of an army motor pool group but his passion is his schemes,negative
every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hairbrained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base,negative
mchales navy s granddaddy,negative
thats the idea behind this movie too but the difference is that as farfetched and usually goofy as the television series was it was funny,negative
there is not one laugh in the film,negative
the remake retains the goofiness but not the entertainment,negative
everything is just too clean,negative
it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it,negative
it all looks brand new even the old beatup stuff,negative
martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role,negative
in the original phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness,negative
martins bilko is a pale imitation,negative
the only semibright spot is phil hartman as bilkos archenemy,negative
its not saying much considering martins lackluster character but hartman leaves him in the dust,negative
capsule annoyingly unentertaining obvious and paperthin witness movie,negative
presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock,negative
ive seen this movie already i said as i looked at the box art,negative
no i havent even seen a trailer for the movie i dont even know what its about but i can look at the way theyre promoting it and i know ive seen it already,negative
i thought its about these two cops,negative
and theyre buddies sort of,negative
theyre at each others throats a lot but they really do like each other,negative
and everyone else in their department hates them cause theyre hotshots,negative
and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship,negative
and one day theyre in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying,negative
and the bad guy is a drug lord,negative
and theres a witness and shes this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way,negative
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down,negative
i only missed the bit about the badges,negative
the rest i got deadon,negative
and i hadnt even left the video store yet,negative
the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo,negative
smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money martin l is a family man shades of the nowtired lethal weapon dynamic here whose wife and he are at total odds,negative
this leads to some strained scenes about lawrences not getting any and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house thinking his partner is now his wifes back door man,negative
not funny tiresome,negative
bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence,negative
will smith is a natural and im happy to see him in movies like six degrees,negative
and men in black,negative
hes funny and charming without trying to be he really does seem to be enjoying himself,negative
martin lawrence is a different story hes so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial,negative
movies like this are not about originality,negative
i know this,negative
they are about style and energy and synergy between actors,negative
i know this too,negative
and yet while watching bad boys which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography i felt fed up,negative
id seen con air which despite being completely implausible was still great fun because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix,negative
bad boys is a dry run and overlong too clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more byplay than i felt could be justified,negative
i could write this movie,negative
you could write this movie,negative
many people have,negative
many people will continue to write this movie over and over again,negative
other people will buy it from them and make it and we will pay money to see it,negative
more the fools we all,negative
in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly phil k dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger as he called it would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange,negative
one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other,negative
the same could be said about this movie,negative
i have the sinking feeling were going to see it again,negative
soon,negative
if i were to plot a graph of year against movieplotridiculity for hollywood movies youll probably see a line with constant gradient,negative
now if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael bruckheimer has made over the last 4 years that line would be exponential in growth,negative
the team started out with the will smith vehicle bad boys which was no more than a 2hr long actionmusicvideo nevertheless entertaining,negative
then came the rock where audiences flocked to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing general fighting over some stupid cause,negative
conair was ridiculousy dumb in its premise but it did have fun moments and who can forget the nursery rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi,negative
while these movies worked because there was something better to coverup the dirt armageddon does not,negative
very much like deep impact a meteor is heading towards earth and they didnt realize it until 18 days from impact,negative
deep impact settled with the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon just had to be bigger well,negative
about the size of texas that kinda meteor whould probably knock earth out of its orbit,negative
the panic of this sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor drill it then nuke it sounds familiar and who better to do such a job than harry stamper bruce willis your very own oildriller extraordinaire and his team of machomisfits nursing the tagline there aint nothin on this planet that harry cant drill,negative
in that 18 days harrys group was split into 2 teams trained for deepspace flight and finally blasted into space in with special drilling vehicles on 2 new space shuttles,negative
the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the relationship of harry a j,negative
and grace,negative
to give you an idea a j,negative
works for harry and loves grace harrys daughter,negative
the problem is harry hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself for the rest of her life,negative
so while a j,negative
and harry struts it out grace is place in a position where she is unable to take sides so she remains seated in the nasa control tower crying over both of them in about 80 of the movie,negative
the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more than just an excuse for more slowmos and goldtinted photography,negative
the anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying running for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky sounds fine right,negative
i know but it looks too out of place on screen too staged,negative
if you were to ask yourself whats the difference between armageddon and a rb music video,negative
youd probably just said the music,negative
not surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry and has actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully,negative
his foray into armageddon just proves that he doesnt when to stop,negative
well theres really nothing much to sum up here,negative
the stockaitkenwaterman of hollywood movies have projected their artform into ridiculity beyond the plane believability where people still accept even if they didnt believe,negative
deep impact was ridiculous in most aspects and i believe the makers know this,negative
the thing is they decided to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of suffering and coming in terms with ones problems which ultimately brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in,negative
armageddon is an overcrowded loud messy preposterously manipulative waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash 20,negative
if you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv tyler bruce willis or the tagline from the makers of the rock,negative
please catch deep impact before it finishes its run it may be the only meteor worth watching in longlong time,negative
if you have to see it please bring earplugs and some aspirins for the vertigo,negative
expect armageddon lds to retail at s19 90 at carrefour come release time,negative
gee even,negative
thats not worth it,negative
although i had not been a viewer of the rugrats television series i went into their first animated feature film the rugrats movie with a positive attitude,negative
the trailer looked cute enough after all,negative
after seeing it i think the words in my recent antz review in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995s the pebble and the penguin were a bit premature,negative
the rugrats movie is bottomofthebarrel childrens fare at its worst and starts to make antz look good in comparison,negative
as in the show the rugrats movie is about a group of very little friends ranging from babies to a threeyearold,negative
the head of the group tommy pickles e g,negative
daily becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill get it,negative
dill pickles hardeeharhar and is informed by his threeyearold cousin anjelica cheryl chase that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children,negative
when the other children chuckie and twins lil and phil suggest taking dill back to the hospital tommy goes along with it but on their way there they crash in the forest and become lost running into wolves and circus monkeys among other things,negative
the rugrats movie judging from the idea of being lost in the woods could have been a potentially fun family film and there were many different things that could have been done with the story,negative
so what did the writers choose to do,negative
why they set up a protracted cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall of course,negative
for the youngest of children ages 37 the rugrats movie may very well entertain them judging from the audience i saw this with,negative
of course if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents they were all desperately struggling to stay awake and that included me,negative
for an adult the rugrats movie is a piece of garbage,negative
the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm,negative
there isnt one laugh to be had in the film nor is there any excitement,negative
if anything is even marginally good in the picture it is the bright animation style so it is especially unfortunate that it wasnt to service a more quality film,negative
the rugrats movie is doa from the start,negative
i am all for a worthwhile family movie but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful,negative
as said before young children may like it but even they deserve better than this,negative
for adults it is a nearly unbearable excruciating chore to sit through,negative
as for me the rugrats movie is not the worst of the year nor is it the most deeply hated but it is the most boring,negative
parents do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of the wizard of oz,negative
that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder two things of which the rugrats movie is completely missing,negative
my name is jack carter and you dont want to know me says our brooding antihero sylvester stallone,negative
take his advice,negative
to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace,negative
and to watch this film is almost as painful,negative
get carter is a gloomy looking unimaginative film that offers no joy,negative
jack carter is as tough as tough guys come,negative
he works out of vegas as a selfdescribed financial adjuster,negative
explaining his duties he says people make promises and break them,negative
i help them remember,negative
he has a chiseled body full of tattoos,negative
he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times,negative
he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice,negative
in other words this is sylvester stallone acting like sylvester,negative
stallone,negative
and like most of his previous roles his character is a shallow onedimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough hassle a few hapless people find out what he needs to know and then dispense his own kind of justice,negative
with the charisma of a pit bull being tough is all that jack carter knows,negative
yet even tough guys know when to put family first,negative
as the story begins we learn that jacks little brother has died in a car accident,negative
the police attribute it to heavy drinking,negative
however jack is suspicious believing that he was taken out,negative
he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth,negative
as he pokes around he runs into several lowlife characters,negative
they include a shady business partner a prostitute a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates and an oily owner of a porn website,negative
any one of them may know something about his brothers death,negative
all of them have the means of carrying out the deed,negative
but dont expect an exercise in sleuthing where wellplaced clues lead carter to the truth,negative
hes all brawn and no brains so there are no epiphanies during his investigation,negative
instead he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward cycling through this circle of suspects,negative
flustered with his lack of progress he cycles through them again and again,negative
this all gets tiring fairly quickly,negative
by the time the film launches into its final act were numb from its pedestrian pace,negative
oddly as a toughguy thriller it starves us for action,negative
admittedly there is one nifty chase sequence but this is related to a tangential and needless plot carters vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him,negative
the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion,negative
stallone has the personality of a slab of stone,negative
and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast,negative
the weather is constantly overcast or rainy,negative
meanwhile most shots take place at night in dimly lit rooms or in dark alleys,negative
its just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere,negative
as a result get carter amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement,negative
youre better off leaving this guy alone,negative
americas sweethearts has an intriguing premise and a great cast but it isnt nearly as edgy or funny as it should be,negative
almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to coscript writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while cohosting comic relief charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of selfindulgence,negative
crystal ignores a simple but crucial rule for a screwball comedy to work the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous,negative
americas sweethearts takes place at a press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters,negative
its a promising setup but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation,negative
by the end of the film all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed,negative
john cusack and catherine zetajones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector hank azaria a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp,negative
of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together six crossed the 100 million mark but the prospects for their final effort a space opus titled time over time are far from rosy,negative
while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup gwens solo films have tanked,negative
to make matter worse the director of the movie christopher walken a visionary who purchased the unabombers cabin and had it moved to his backyard is withholding the film from the studio insisting that the first screening be held at the junket,negative
desperate to win over the press the studio elects to hire lee billy crystal a recently fired publicist to salvage the situation,negative
lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation,negative
he enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwens sister personal assistant and whipping girl,negative
what lee doesnt know is that kiki is in love with eddie a fact that could temper her effectiveness,negative
press junkets are a haven for control freaks,negative
studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel with food and drink always at hand,negative
generally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel,negative
the next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews,negative
every 30 minutes or so a producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things,negative
the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes a question they may not be invited to future junkets,negative
representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions,negative
they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges,negative
the reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs,negative
placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit,negative
the junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas,negative
for most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press,negative
when they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is declawed,negative
gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions,negative
lee certainly isnt bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids,negative
is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors,negative
hell no they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie,negative
all of which underscores how billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in americas sweethearts is based on barelyincontrol people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it doesnt matter because any publicity is good publicity,negative
and thus the very setup for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter,negative
so what about the cast,negative
julia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit and not a very convincing one by the way,negative
catherine zetajones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic,negative
by casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks,negative
in supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad,negative
seth green is amusing as a toadie stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with,negative
come to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie,negative
as a hollywood satire americas sweethearts is toothless,negative
as a romance it is at best a minor pleasure,negative
such a good cast such a waste of their efforts,negative
had it not been taken long ago a better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing,negative
movies based on video games such as street fighter or mario bros have never generated much interest at the box office,negative
but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 it did surprisingly well,negative
with a simple story a pulsating soundtrack and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy,negative
it got my vote for the movie where i expected the least and got the most,negative
and if you havent had the opportunity i would definitely recommend that you see it on video,negative
in the world of mortal kombat based on the popular arcade game dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earths realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity,negative
the mortal kombat refers to a competition fought by human mortals against outworlds minions which if won will guarantee earths safety for another generation,negative
mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition,negative
despite their victory however a gateway has somehow opened and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth,negative
outworlds warriors include an impressive collection of fighters including shao kahn mintoro a centaur sheeva a fourarmed ogre and sindel,negative
earths mortal warriors under the leadership of the benevolent god lord rayden includes liu kang princess kitana sonya blade and jax who must fight against outworlds forces,negative
its an easy enough premise but unfortunately very unfortunately the writers try to do too much with the movie,negative
it is only a video game after all but the onscreen version tries to go beyond its comic book boundaries by adding depth a conceptualization of selfworth and worst of all a love story,negative
this becomes very awkward because all of the players are fighters and nothing more,negative
they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act,negative
this becomes embarrassingly apparent for example as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana,negative
the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best,negative
they spoke little but fought a lot,negative
thus the movie was easy to digest,negative
however mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth an element that was lacking in the first movie but the attempt here fails miserably,negative
this uneasy feeling is readily apparent for example whenever you hear lord rayden speak,negative
not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic e g,negative
useless advice but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom,negative
try reading this half as fast and youll hear what i mean,negative
but the movie is not a complete fatality,negative
fight scenes are wellchoreographed highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility,negative
and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo,negative
even if youre not familiar with the video game each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves,negative
but its just too little of what moviegoers and especially fans of the game will expect,negative
oddly the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence,negative
and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival,negative
i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom,negative
rent the first one but the sequel is for kombat fans only,negative
wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you,negative
you can see its plot developing from a mile away you,negative
are lured into its benign story of a single 29yearold girl looking for a soul mate in boston as that city is depicted as a miniwonderland for singles,negative
this is a star oriented film and the star who carries the film is erin hope davis,negative
that this is a dating film about singles who for reasons of fate or luck or whatnot have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers is nothing new this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films,negative
the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film the,negative
main quirk in the plot here is that hopes pushy mother hollan visits her in boston sees her daughters livein relationship with a radical protester hoffman breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school dropout daughter who works as a nurse,negative
this is done without her knowledge,negative
it is cornball sitcom stuff but at least it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director,negative
it is easy to like erin she is bright caring and attractively blonde,negative
it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with the financially strapped ruggedly handsome intelligent 35yearold alan alan who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist,negative
of course he comes across as being so good though he does kill some fish in the aquarium that it is hard to believe hes for real or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for,negative
the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as the subway at a restaurant or on the phone,negative
alans brother answers erins ad with a few of his pals as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her that the others witness will win the bet,negative
this subplot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told,negative
that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are each one more annoying than the other culminating in the most obnoxious one of all that brazilian lover jose who is about as charming as a snakeoil salesman who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story,negative
anyway as expected alls well that ends well for this watchable piece of fluff that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its storyline,negative
the dialogue was actually not bad those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation,negative
and oh by the way wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro it is where greyhound racing takes place,negative
ever feel youre spending your whole life on the net ouch eating breathing and excreting web sites,negative
that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net,negative
that you get your best sex on the net,negative
if firsttime director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers he would,negative
as it is he settles for characters talking on the phone,negative
denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone,negative
its a satire and a sometimes funny one about how we let handphones callwaiting and answering machines run our lives,negative
the problem denise calls up is a movie about an idea,negative
a darn good one but still an 80 minutelong idea,negative
and despite salwens attempt at plots and subplots despite some genuinely funny moments you can predict the movies outcome within the first fifteen minutes,negative
you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldnt make it for a party nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film they would rather be talking on the phone,negative
heres salwens plot while all the characters are in a dysfunctional telefixated limbo loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank,negative
as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the babys name his friends and his friends friends get involved courtesy of callwaiting and doublelines,negative
in the tigher and more tantalizing subplot barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for,negative
both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet but they get it going over the phone,negative
with repeated phone sex comes a glitch what if the other person is simply faking it,negative
denise calls up scores with some inspired moments,negative
mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless everyone shares the excitement of denises delivery through a conference call to her handphone and barbaras best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friends answering machine,negative
as gales overlychatty aunt recounts her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain,negative
but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie,negative
the pace sags the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephonetouters,negative
and the ending is literally a nonevent as expected everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gales memory despite promising over the phone that they will,negative
we get the point,negative
the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears,negative
pun intended,negative
theres even a on the movies web site where you can win cellular phones as if we havent had enough of these things already,negative
watch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful,negative
the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
if youre into watching near on two hours of bored foulmouthed florida teens having sex doing drugs having sex listening to eminem having sex playing video games having sex and killing one of their peers then bully s for you,negative
based on jim schutzes novelization of a truelife event bully charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who in 1993 murdered their high school bully in cold calculated blood,negative
the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers,negative
in the hands of controversial director larry clark kids however it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmakers pornographic proclivities,negative
in terms of the incident and what provoked it bully stirs up nothing new,negative
the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lotbored with life not much ambition promiscuous profane,negative
the bully in question bobby kent nick stahl is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesnt exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department,negative
he hounds and harries and humiliates his best friend marty played by brad renfro and martys girlfriend lisa rachel miner doesnt care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby,negative
simply remove him from the equation,negative
marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous profane and stoner friends plus a recruited hit man lure bobby to a swamp one night stab him beat him over the head with a baseball bat and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators presumably finish him off,negative
theres no remorsethe next day theyre talking about it as openly as a homework assignment,negative
they did it because they wanted to and because they could,negative
whats most troubling about the film however isnt the unsettling subject matter and the matteroffact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material,negative
not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in bully but theres also an uneasy exploitative feel to it,negative
gratuitous crotch shots abound one of which makes the zipper cutaway in theres something about mary look like the height of subtlety,negative
clark is so preoccupied with his female predominantly leads that you forget at times what this movie is supposed to be about,negative
the stripping bare literally and figuratively of these actors who are after all playing underage teenagers becomes harder to watch over time as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera,negative
the conclusion of bully offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime,negative
its a short sequence of stillsheather 7 years ali 40 years lisa life imprisonment for examplebut its infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it,negative
bully aims for truth exploits it shamelessly then bludgeons it to death,negative
there have been merchantivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than the mod squad a selfconsciously hip cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many babyboomers,negative
well said squad certainly wont be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards,negative
a contemporary take on this decidedly 70s show doesnt exactly seem unwarranted but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didnt transform into a fullblown case of botulism,negative
how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time,negative
they are julie pete and linc reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd exposition put out of the way so fast that youre likely to be lost from the opening moments on and they are respectively played by claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps talented actors each deserving of better than this,negative
their plight involves standard copcorruption stuff as our wouldbe protagonists catch wind of an internal coverup after their superior reliable dennis farina one of the best things here and gone so quickly gets killed and framed for drug trafficking,negative
they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others,negative
when youre supposed to be asking whats going to happen next,negative
youll instead entertain thoughts like who are these people and why should i care,negative
or arent thrillers supposed to contain thrills,negative
not that danes epps and ribisi dont give it a shot,negative
danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep as evidenced by my socalled life but shes saddled with a mysteriousboyfriend josh brolin subplot so seethrough you begin to seriously question her socalled intelligence,negative
ditto for ribisis saving private ryan looney loose cannon though at least he performs with a wildandcrazy vigor that occasionally demands attention,negative
but epps poor epps,negative
epps higher learning is so shortchanged hes reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him,negative
all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters one of whom scott silver is also the director,negative
they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings the look of the film is really quite impressive itll somehow pay off but this mod squad plods anyway,negative
characters are nonexistent present are just some goodlooking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes,negative
plot hardly escapes confusing convention,negative
and the one genre element youd think would be show up in generous portions a few nifty explosions some fights any kind of action whatsoever only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest,negative
all those quick to put down last months inept but serviceable my favorite martian update need to take a step back,negative
heres a smalltobigscreen translation that really shouldve stayed in its former incarnation mod or not,negative
look the new version of psycho came out and the world didnt end,negative
i guess gus van sant really isnt the bringer of the apocalypse,negative
unfortunately though that psycho didnt end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it,negative
van sants controversial retelling of alfred hitchcocks classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere even before it premiered,negative
without benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the film will at best suck,negative
being an almost good critic i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film at best sucked and that concludes the use of the word suck and hopefully the thoughts that i am a braindead orangutan,negative
director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it shotforshot using the same exact script with a few minor alterations,negative
the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time,negative
suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original,negative
sadly that did not occur,negative
it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin from the original psycho but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen,negative
in moores case the film would have been helped if the x files gillian anderson had been cast instead especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression,negative
from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence moore is scully,negative
mortensen who i liked in g i,negative
jane opts to play sam loomis as a which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point,negative
sam has a twang and a cowboy hat but thats about it,negative
mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory,negative
anne heche in the janet leigh role does a few good things in her brief time on screen,negative
at least her marion crane has a little life in her which cant be said for most of the rest of the cast,negative
the best work though comes from vince vaughn as the demented mamas boy norman bates,negative
hes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins but he is effective both in being naughty and nice,negative
the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn where they simply talk,negative
there is some solid acting there something that is not carried through the rest of the film,negative
van sant has made a boring film,negative
all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 arent as eyecatching now,negative
what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they dont impress or excite,negative
van sant in what i assume is a grasp at originality decided to put some streamofconsciousness images into a few famous scenes was that a lamb in the middle of the road,negative
these images included with some questionable editing choices took away from the scenes themselves and caused at first bewilderment and later laughter,negative
definitely not hitchcocks intention,negative
at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score,negative
if a film like psycho does not frighten then whats the point,negative
aside from norman the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience,negative
there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting,negative
in the end however the new psycho is a noble attempt but alas a dismal failure,negative
the working title for no looking back was long time nothing new and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture,negative
even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics,negative
edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasnt spent their life in seclusion,negative
instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way,negative
no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful,negative
the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide and the sooner the better,negative
alas thats not the case and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio,negative
and to further depress audiences burns has shot the entire film on cold rainy days in a gray new york state beach town,negative
peeks of sunshine are few and far between,negative
no wonder the characters are all so miserable,negative
first of all we have charlie burns a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home,negative
that girlfriend is claudia lauren holly and after picking up the pieces of her life following charlies departure she has moved on shacking up with one of charlies old school buddies mike jon bon jovi,negative
the two have a comfortable relationship but its apparent to even a blind person that theyre not right for each other,negative
claudia years for some spice in her life mike wants to settle down and have children,negative
then charlie reenters the mix,negative
so who if anyone will claudia end up with,negative
who cares,negative
no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that were not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle,negative
so what if no one finds happiness these characters dont deserve it anyway especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time,negative
they arent real people theyre a writers construct stumbling through a tooobvious storyline,negative
they should know the ending as well as we do,negative
and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two,negative
another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentiallyinteresting supporting characters,negative
blythe danner is solid as claudias housebound mother connie britton is suitably highstrung as claudias neurotic sister and jennifer esposito is eyecatching as a bartender in search of a little romance,negative
sadly all we get is quick glimpses into their lives although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell,negative
none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes,negative
edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here,negative
jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career but he could still use a little polish,negative
the worst case is lauren holly who presents a completely bland claudia,negative
as portrayed here shes hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moments interest not to mention undying love,negative
burns ex the monumentally untalented maxine bahns would have been hardpressed to do a less inspired job,negative
when he released the brothers mcmullen edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival robert redford has apparently stuck with him the aging executive produced this mess,negative
two films and three short years later the luster has faded,negative
some movie makers have only one good film in them,negative
with back toback duds like shes the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club,negative
theres a 1 000foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact,negative
id say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release,negative
the early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes,negative
deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking,negative
the repeating cycle is as follows the president morgan freeman will go on tv and tell the country that theres a remote chance a comet will strike the earth but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem,negative
then we get to see the plan in action in some sequence utterly lacking suspense,negative
the mission will barely fail and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth and theres a remote chance it will strike but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem,negative
it goes on and on throughout the movie but every time freeman goes on tv we know his plan is going to fail,negative
how do we know this,negative
because weve seen the tv ads for deep impact ads that feature freeman telling the nation that the comet is still headed right for us and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading,negative
ladies and gentlemen that is the movie,negative
successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30second tv spots,negative
television is whats wrong with deep impact,negative
the main character played by tea leoni is a lowlevel broadcast journalist for msnbc and thats the mere tip of the productplacement iceberg who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy,negative
she thinks its an instance of an exsecretary of something or other james cromwell resigning because of a mistress and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area,negative
when she goes nosing around cromwell he begs her to keep it under wraps,negative
i know youre just a reporter but you used to be a human being,negative
she figures out whats really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction level comet,negative
upon a topsecret meeting with president freeman leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference at which she gets to ask the first question,negative
and everyone knows if you get to ask the first question baby youre a star,negative
leoni ends up in the anchor chair broadcasting every step of the comets collision course with earth,negative
and im sure its comforting for her to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of months shes a cable news personality,negative
so there she is narrating the sixastronaut mission to blow the comet up,negative
such personalities as robert duvall jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this draggedout process,negative
but as anyone whos seen the commercials knows the astronauts fail,negative
they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces which means even more destruction to the earth,negative
yeah thanks nasa,negative
thats when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who arent picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years,negative
they even have animals two by two ready to climb into the cave,negative
if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie,negative
instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife while people pack the highways out of town,negative
the reasoning is of course that if a comet is going to strike they might as well be out in some scenic rural location,negative
and amusingly the highway is spotted with people in uhaul trucks,negative
im sure its comforting to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of minutes the uhaul people are doing the most business of their lives,negative
synopsis sullen julie james still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas,negative
arriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize theyve walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand,negative
comments i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five,negative
i am only vaguely aware of the shows premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i halfpaid attention to while watching the tube,negative
party of five i do know however seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre,negative
neve campbell scream queen of the 90s and star of scream scream 2 and the craft is a regular of the show,negative
so too is jennifer love hewitt,negative
lo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own the i know what you did last summer line,negative
though the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theaters glowing red exit sign longingly throughout,negative
jennifer love hewitt is a very goodlooking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting,negative
she just isnt convincing in this film and she wasnt in the original either,negative
this puts many young males including myself in a paradoxical quandary shes very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girltype character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure,negative
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience,negative
ive spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason,negative
i still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses,negative
nothing else here is original or interesting,negative
this movie in fact makes other recent soso horror films like urban legend and john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works of high art,negative
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches an isolated location a storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of bluelighted darkness scenes a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture,negative
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killers hook,negative
they may as well have huge targets painted on them,negative
like scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief,negative
unfortunately i still knows characters arent all that funny,negative
in particular one character a chainweedsmoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesnt die soon enough,negative
the death scenes by the way are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film,negative
several of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline a truly sadistic movie,negative
this too did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for,negative
and what is the deal with the slasher himself,negative
i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror,negative
come on the guy looks like the gortons fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate,negative
though his lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film and thats really saying something,negative
so all thats left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy,negative
both prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene,negative
hewitt however does do a postshower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite,negative
titillating,negative
this scene alone made this onestar turkey earn two stars under my rating system,negative
otherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves,negative
early in the film for instance brandy wins the trip to the bahamas,negative
she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever,negative
i needed extrastrength tylenol after that part,negative
oh and the films conclusion talk about repetitive,negative
people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still knows ending at least 5 minutes before it happens,negative
boring,negative
i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater,negative
admission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them,negative
its usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who dont seem to mind participating in a mass mystery science theater 3000 type viewing,negative
i still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is,negative
if it werent for the main actresses revealing wardrobes id have had a very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel,negative
i cant imagine trying to watch it on video horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and wouldnt recommend it to people unless theyre horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy,negative
i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works,negative
what a depressing thought,negative
hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act,negative
rated r this film contains lots of violence several gory scenes and a couple nubile horny teenagersthough the sex act itself is always thwarted,negative
id say this is unsuitable for kids but teens wouldnt have a problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the films target audience,negative
an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis 1981 feature an american werewolf in london,negative
where the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sitcoms,negative
where the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny,negative
in short while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity,negative
the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans andy tom everett scott brad vince vieluf and chris phil buckman sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping,negative
soon they have company in the person of serafine julie delpy who has decided to end it all,negative
she jumps but andy with a bungee cord attached goes after her and manages to save her at the price of a major headache,negative
serafine disappears but a smitten andy seeks her out,negative
however once he learns his wouldbe girlfriends dark secret he wishes he hadnt,negative
shes a werewolf cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full and to make matters worse he has suffered a nasty bite himself,negative
actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie,negative
she imbues serafine with spirit spunk and humanity which gives us an emotional stake in the characters fate,negative
this isnt necessarily a good thing since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless campy entertainment experience,negative
delpys injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her,negative
delpys previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowskis white and richard linklaters before sunrise,negative
she was radiant charismatic and effective in both,negative
given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here she gets as close as possible to those adjectives,negative
it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss,negative
and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts,negative
the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy which is to say they give performances appropriate for the screenplay,negative
tom everett scott that thing you do plays the lead like hes in a madefortv movie,negative
it would be kind to call him bland,negative
actors vince vieluf and phil buckman as andys friends are no more impressive,negative
julie bowen happy gilmore is suitably fetching as werewolf meat,negative
and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal,negative
on the technical side its all bad news,negative
the computergenerated werewolves look painfully unreal,negative
the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits,negative
repeated use is made of the werewolf cam an infrared wolfs pointofview approach thats interesting the first couple of times its employed then becomes tedious,negative
and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the onscreen action theyre matched to,negative
director anthony waller who displayed a confident edgy style in mute witness stumbles with this material never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel,negative
as a result we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii your sister is a werewolf,negative
i will give waller credit for killing off a dog though something thats rarely seen in movies these days an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a bad movie sort of way but thats a dubious distinction,negative
ultimately its an unfortunate effort for while it isnt unbearable to sit through it isnt a howl either,negative
this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time,negative
a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyones favorite goaliemaskwearing homicidal maniac,negative
jason the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area doesnt start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel,negative
while he does have a small role in this film we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count,negative
the plot like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie,negative
the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story,negative
but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot here are the basics,negative
a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp,negative
they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids,negative
sadly they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer,negative
at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production,negative
since im not going to do that feel free to assume that if i did it wouldnt be positive,negative
i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks and that includes the actors salaries,negative
if you are used to recent horror films like scream you are in for a bit of a surprise,negative
the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind with the killer taking real pride in their work,negative
using as many methods of murder as they could,negative
none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre or the creatively stifled imagination of halloweens michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife,negative
nope in the friday the 13th movies you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work,negative
one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again,negative
the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning,negative
if not stick with the later films with jason everyones favorite hockey fan,negative
friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from just dont sit down expecting a whole lot,negative
one night during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets we went to see what else hard rain,negative
so are we all going to die,negative
the sheriff randy quaid asks in the storys opening line as he evacuates his flooded town,negative
the answer is pretty much yes but not nearly soon enough,negative
and to add insult to injury the supposedly dead regretfully often turn out not to be so,negative
populating this bad tvmovieoftheweek material are a host of talented actors,negative
one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture,negative
besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie,negative
graham yosts script serves up one cliche after another for the actors who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines,negative
director mikael salomons staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening,negative
the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies jr s dark and ugly cinematography,negative
the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water,negative
onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie,negative
christian slater who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart plays tom,negative
edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie,negative
coming to their rescue is a gang headed by jim played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman,negative
he views the loot three million dollars worth as his retirement plan,negative
the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang who are in turn after tom,negative
along the way tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifixweapon wielding woman named karen played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver,negative
the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest,negative
they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake,negative
christopher youngs emotionless score for the film has a single trait earshattering loudness,negative
the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks submerging the town,negative
the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns,negative
the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly,negative
when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees,negative
counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other,negative
the show has a single but unprintable good line,negative
betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife and when her henpecked husband finally told her off our audience roared with laughter,negative
the show concludes with a sickening set of twists,negative
the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad,negative
hard rain runs 1 37,negative
it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers,negative
the two families behind us shockingly had a halfdozen preschoolers among them,negative
susan grangers review of mulholland drive universal focus,negative
whatever david lynch is selling im not buying,negative
from the of blue velvet and twin peaks comes another dark mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills,negative
dazed a beautiful brunette laura elena harring emerges and stumbles down a hill slipping unobserved into a 30sstyle apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip,negative
the next morning a dewy blonde naomi watts from deep river ontario arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase,negative
her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet,negative
the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust,negative
meanwhile a hotshot director justin theroux whose wife is in bed with the poolman is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and theres an assassin mark pellegrino roaming the city,negative
the tortuous paths of these various characters and others named cookie coco and cowboy intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because midway through the story lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality leaving a huge wad of cash a blue metallic key a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered,negative
elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses effectively making the subtle switch,negative
the same cannot be said for former m g m,negative
dancer ann miller whos stiff and selfconscious speaking like most lynch players in staccato tones,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 mulholland drive is a frenzied frustrating 4 originally designed as an episodic tv pilot this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out,negative
as you should know this summer has been less than memorable,negative
with a total of 4 decent films its not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing,negative
with that said you can pretty much predict what my opinion on the 13th warrior will be,negative
the film is based on the michael crichton eaters of the dead in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king,negative
after tarveling for many months he comes across a gang of norsemen who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog,negative
so they start picking men and are left without 1 thus ahmed is choosen,negative
so far it sounds interesting right,negative
not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes,negative
after that they basically run around killing,negative
that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film because once your story is introduced you have the rest of the film to start developing it,negative
obviously thats not the case here,negative
even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure you will be disappointed,negative
since all the action takes place in fog it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances and to poor camera work,negative
cant the camera men sit still,negative
id like to actually watch a film in focus but again they failed to deliver that as well,negative
the film moves on and on until the point where you can care less about anything but the popcorn youre eating,negative
with corny dialogue that the characters laugh at for some odd reason a script that goes nowhere dull action sequences a predictable ending and worst of all weak characters theres basically nothing to like here except for maybe the set designs,negative
thats the only thing that honestly caught my interest,negative
when i heard that john mctiernan the director wanted his name kept out of the project that made me wonder why,negative
well now i know,negative
crichtons greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product which led to a big arguement,negative
whats there to argue about anyway,negative
the film couldnt be saved no matter how much they spent or casted,negative
seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money i wouldnt be surprised to see the 13th warrior become a hit,negative
please do me a favor and save your money at all costs or else you will be lost in the fog like the film itself,negative
phew what a mess,negative
for his fifth collaboration with director rich ard donner lethal weapon iiii maverick mel gibson plays a motormouth maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie jerry whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice julia roberts acting all serious the justice department employee that he has a crush on,negative
she not interested but another person is a cia psychiatrist patrick stewart who promptly kidnaps him,negative
is one of jerrys conjectures correct,negative
is the metal strip in the new 100 bill being used to track your movements,negative
is oliver stone still alive because he cut a deal with george bush to spread dis information,negative
is this movie really about any of the crazed cabbies theories,negative
no no and no,negative
as it turns out theres some other nonsense going on here involving and revolving around jerrys background,negative
hint pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back in quick succession to images of an interrogation room hypodermic needles and ms roberts herself,negative
the initial premise is pretty good and is played for a while at a delightfully dizzying clip,negative
mel is wideropen that weve ever seen him and if his characters relationship with roberts initially strains credibility their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating,negative
the highest wattage of the summer perhaps,negative
even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude the two remain a randy dandy screen pair,negative
theres a great scene in jerrys fortress er apartment with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container,negative
which he stores in another locked con tainer his fridge,negative
other hilarious moments of which there are many include a trio of memorable conventionbreakers where alice ditches a tail jerry coldcocks someone and later eludes a foot pursuit each in a uproariously unexpected fashion,negative
thats donners own ladyhawke playing in the theater btw,negative
lets see other pleasures include,negative
a brilliant title sequence a jazzy score from carter burwell and the worthpayingtosee sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming anothers head into a wall,negative
oh pretty woman,negative
getting to the latter however requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story,negative
the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable,negative
more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here except perhaps for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts,negative
and here i thought it was wabbit season,negative
good god who rewrites these movies,negative
and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles,negative
synopsis a maniac crazed by virulent microphage slaughters more than twenty people including a street gang and heavilyarmed troops with a small knife,negative
even with a handgun however he cant take out the two cops who are after him despite having shot one of them a total of seven times,negative
comments the most notable aspect of adrenalin fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge,negative
not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses,negative
this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles though i admit it doesnt show in this mess,negative
henstridge just like every other actor in the film delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey,negative
the cast also includes christopher lambert who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films,negative
how on earth this movie got two bigname stars to appear in it is beyond me,negative
adrenalin fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future 2007,negative
boston has changed dramatically in those ten years,negative
it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with policia printed on their doors,negative
some guy has a really bad virus and hes killing people because of it,negative
so the brave good guys lambert and henstridge go after him,negative
thats it,negative
76 minutes never seemed so long,negative
this is a drawnout chase scene through dimlylit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie,negative
the plot development is nil we learn absolutely nothing about lamberts character and very little about henstridges character,negative
the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark airduct next and who will carry the flashlight,negative
a subplot does exist involving henstridges characters illegal attempt to get her son out of boston,negative
in her opening monologue a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son,negative
twenty minutes into the film i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot,negative
in a defining scene of the movie however i changed my mind,negative
this fake passport drops to the ground,negative
lamberts cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away,negative
must not have been a good fake,negative
this emphasizes another fault with the film,negative
things just defy common sense,negative
lamberts cop for instance is shot seven times yet he is still able to talk and slide about,negative
adrenalin fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesnt seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for,negative
i found myself rather bored with this film which will disappoint both sci fans and fans of henstridge and lambert,negative
dont fear the rush,negative
fear the movie,negative
watch something else,negative
warner brothers has scored another marketing coup,negative
the onetwo punch was started in the summer with the release of batman forever,negative
trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel,negative
carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the everwise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video 11 99 at walmart a mere two weeks before carreys return in this marketwise but misfired comedy,negative
ace ventura when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubberfaced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment,negative
he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher in batman forever but here left to his own devices carrey quickly wears out his welcome,negative
the opening sequence is by far the bestan amusing spoof of cliffhanger with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon,negative
you can guess what happens to mr paws,negative
hint it sounds like splat,negative
the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas and then to notsodarkest africa where ace is on the case of a missing white bat,negative
with his hair and limbs both wildly askew carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes,negative
the rest of the film is just more of the same,negative
sure the plots linear and the production values solid but where is the scripted humor to support carreys sloppy slathering,negative
writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few setups,negative
instead carrey just mugs away playing for the camera even when most of it isnt funny,negative
the better gags have been shown in the ads though a bit with ace emerging bucknaked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see,negative
though an arguable improvement over the original ace ventura when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten,negative
the script is virtually devoid of wit,negative
tribal mask jokes,negative
jerry lewis cameos,negative
forget it,negative
if anything the inexplicable presence of simon callow four weddings and a funeral and bob gunton the shawshank redemption suggests that working with carrey is the classical actors ultimate challenge,negative
just how long can they keep a straight face,negative
preposterous religious action film produced by the trinity broadcasting network about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh,negative
michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies while casper van dien terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him,negative
michael ironside great as always despite the silly film surrounding him plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael yorks character,negative
heres some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironsides character,negative
now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene the filmmakers arent quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil,negative
how do they fix that,negative
make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes,negative
there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking,negative
oooooo scary,negative
but even that wasnt enough for the filmmakers apparently as they later have to infer that ironsides character is gay,negative
it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense,negative
my main problem with this film is that despite the silly story which could have been pulled off,negative
anything can be made believable if executed correctly the events of the film arent shown with any sense of urgency or importance,negative
for example at one point yorks character is declared chancellor of the world or something and we see one brief cheesy news report about it,negative
the movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming but it never seems that way,negative
theres no world reaction to anything,negative
the omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video,negative
it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and includes the original theatrical trailer a documentary on the making of the film production notes and cast and crew information,negative
the documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew with the exception of michael ironside unfortunately,negative
the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set,negative
most documentaries tend to overlook this,negative
doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed youll remember his documentary from the 1970s called the late great planet earth where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist,negative
however at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side,negative
when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say ever see raiders of the lost ark,negative
well our film is like that,negative
no it isnt,negative
not by a long shot,negative
pg13,negative
supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898,negative
john patterson val kilmer the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation tried to rid his operation of the lions but fails,negative
a world renound hunter remington michael douglas is called in and the battle man against lion begins,negative
this film has a great soundtrack and wonderful scenery,negative
the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin,negative
we only see one side of each character,negative
kilmer is a bridge builder and thats all we see him as,negative
these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesnt even appear to be too upset about it,negative
and the plot,negative
its jaws but with lions,negative
again were presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should,negative
it appears to kill men because it just likes too,negative
why,negative
who knows,negative
i guess there wouldnt be much of a story if it didnt,negative
the problem is that there isnt much of a story even though it does,negative
this film is extraordinarily horrendous and im not going to waste any more words on it,negative
written by david j schow and john shirley based on the comic book series and comic book strip by james obarr,negative
cast brandon lee ernie hudson michael wincott david patrick kelly rochelle davis and jon polito,negative
mpaa rating r presumably for rape language and violence,negative
running time 100 minutes,negative
looks like he zigged when he shouldve zagged,negative
ernie hudson as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death,negative
comic book translations are notorious tricky anyone up for a doublebill of the punisher and captain america and the crow proves no exception,negative
despite a gross of good intentions brandon lees final film doesnt fly very high,negative
the story opens on halloween eve better known as devils night,negative
wilmingtonasdetroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least one murder young rockmusicianturnedpavementartist eric draven lee found on a sidewalk sixstories below the apartment he was thrown from,negative
the cops are also upstairs administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order,negative
she dies the perps,negative
escape and exactly one year later draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge,negative
sound familiar,negative
unlike charles bronson whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels lees character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2 by his side is his crow the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration,negative
wearing what appears to be alice coopers leftover makeup lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner,negative
but no number of redlit rainsoaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman,negative
the glaring miniatures should show better on video though,negative
a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi though because alex proyas cant film a decent action scene to save his life,negative
his two best setpieces some banzai boardroom butchery and a cool church roof sword fight are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith,negative
blame said editors for the films frightful flashbacks as well,negative
but the pace is quick thank god and every goodideaturnedbad is over before it begins,negative
the cast is better than it should be,negative
ernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the films funnier lines,negative
newcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and dravens scrappy ward,negative
jon polito has a small succulent role as pungent pawnbroker,negative
and michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a longhaired mr big whose collection of ancientswords makes him seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to highlander iii,negative
there can be only one,negative
finally theres brandon lee son of bruce lee and a 28yearold risingstar who was fatally shot during shooting,negative
lee had four films to his name kung fu the movie laser mission showdown in little toyko and rapid fire and the crow wouldve been a nice feather in his belt and thats about it,negative
theres nothing great from him here just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability,negative
when the echo of that gunshot finally fades watching the crow should prove an even less remarkable experience,negative
despite a healthy dose of humor and some surprising sincerity the crow is still just a couple notches above its straighttovideo brethren,negative
for now maybe its an appropriate eulogy to an actor who could only get better,negative
its difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of awardwinning tv commercials as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes,negative
that said hayess feature film debut lives up to expectations coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic,negative
but occasionally bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary,negative
those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the films two stars jake gyllenhall as the immunodeficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his overprotective hyper religious reaganloving mother,negative
gyllenhalls sweetnatured delivery of jimmys hilariously na ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy comingofage story jimmy is a bubble boy a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld,negative
his mom homeschools jimmy filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and antisexual messages until hes befriended by chloe marley shelton the beautiful girl next door,negative
jimmy falls in love with chloe but is afraid that his love will literally kill him as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss,negative
but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinksaddled crosscountry voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love,negative
the offensive bits have little to do with jimmys rare handicap regardless of what the films protesters would have you believe but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi,negative
but even if you find stereotype humor funny its hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags,negative
they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks,negative
but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work especially in the case of kurtz who very bluntly shows the dark hypocritical side of the religious right and a wacky sendup of a cult called bright n shiny led by the inimitable fabio,negative
unfortunately a few giggles cant make bubble boy the riotous offthewall comedy it so desperately wants to be,negative
honestly its a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made and im not just saying that because its so mediocre,negative
how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesnt seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many,negative
and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of reallife bubble boy david philip vetter maybe disneys wondering the same thing,negative
hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile,negative
starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role,negative
not that cindy does that bad its just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindys extraordinary acting skills but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation,negative
and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty but im sure that that is just a coincidence no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet well thats just a happy coincidence,negative
sure,negative
william baldwin isnt a bad actor,negative
unfortunately he just doesnt demonstrate it at all in this movie,negative
im not sure if thats because most of his lines were just so hokey or if he was trying to make cindys acting look good,negative
if it was the latter it worked,negative
cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie,negative
which is not to say that she doesnt have room for improvement,negative
although to be fair to cindy her lines were kinda cheesy in places,negative
so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet chose for her foray into the world of cinema,negative
well im glad you asked that question,negative
cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents,negative
why woud they target someone as likable as cindy you ask,negative
by the end of the movie you wont care,negative
the story is so contrived it isnt funny,negative
anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house without getting so much as a scratch i might add she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin,negative
whos character max kilpatric a police detective seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagals early films,negative
the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwins characters of the run from these killer russians isnt all that bad of an idea its just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud,negative
the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes,negative
if i was baldwin id hope this film disappears,negative
as for crawford she may indeed have some acting ability,negative
unfortunately any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad,negative
this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks,negative
its too bad they hadnt spent more time on a half decent plot since ms crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much,negative
unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you,negative
tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie,negative
the film which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage and while its evident that this could be a fascinating live production the translation to the screen is a creative disaster,negative
enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art lifeless and tedious,negative
the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium,negative
tectonic plates has a storyline although the narrative is developed in a decidedly nontraditional fashion with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences,negative
its not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious allbutscreaming look,negative
art,negative
although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters,negative
because were constantly made aware that were watching a play or a movie its impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas,negative
theyre not real sympathetic or believable,negative
im willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different but this particular experiment is not a success,negative
tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine marie gignac an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor jacques lapage,negative
one day he disappears and fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love madeleine travels to venice to kill herself,negative
while preparing to commit suicide she encounters drug addict constance celine bonnier who causes madeleine to rethink her decision,negative
meanwhile jacques has moved to new york city where he starts crossdressing calls himself jennifer and becomes a successful counterculture talkshow host,negative
with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a and cultural references that point to chopin george sand and jim morrison tectonic plates is unique if nothing else,negative
however as interesting as the film sounds and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising it never really delivers,negative
the tone is soporific the supposedlyintellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner although it doesnt take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant and the symbolism is obvious,negative
tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth but it takes onehundred minutes to get across this transparent point,negative
there are some worthwhile moments such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who arent bilingual,negative
the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because a its different b its not like anything theyve seen before and c its pretentious,negative
for everyone else its not only a waste of time but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage,negative
the main problem with martin lawrences pet project a thin line between love and hate like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man is that his character is an irresponsible jerk and if that is the case it doesnt seem to do anything except justify the womans actions,negative
that is especially the case in lawrences darnell wright,negative
he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long,negative
now dont think i condone this just because im male,negative
my philosophy is if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful kind girl you should treat her like a princess and respect her,negative
darnell doesnt think like this,negative
he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them,negative
and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target beautiful wealthy brandi web played nicely by whitfield who runs a successful real estate business is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia king i found myself thinking im supposed to feel sorry for this guy,negative
after all it is largely darnells fault,negative
if he is lining up all these women youd think hed have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day as his mother says it does,negative
but he doesnt so you get the sense that hes not only irresponsible but also pretty dumb,negative
you especially get this sense that hes dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her,negative
id put my pants on in two seconds after that,negative
now brandi is a psycho bitch but its hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage,negative
one final flaw though is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with,negative
brandi is a classy intelligent woman with an mba from harvard who initally resists darnells immature play as she calls it as any woman like her would in real life,negative
but all of a sudden she says yes,negative
but when you listen to darnells four letter word vocabulary watch his actions you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him,negative
lawrence can be good when he wants to but in order to prove it he needs to let other people write and direct his movies,negative
look at this movie,negative
four writers as a result its too long two hours when it couldve easily worked at ninety minutes and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came which makes me think the writers didnt get along all of which isnt necessary,negative
there are some bright spots though,negative
whitfield regina king della reese and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts and they help it out a lot,negative
and there are some funny parts like for example the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property but theyre just not enough to sustain the film,negative
bad bad,negative
bad,negative
that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls,negative
if that summary isnt enough for you how about ta ta ta,negative
still havent got the point,negative
other than director russ meyers predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the aforementioned anatomical areas there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie,negative
that is the fact that it was cowritten by famed film critic roger ebert who also was responsible for the screenplay,negative
after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face,negative
this movie stinks out loud,negative
quite frankly this movie deserves a,negative
but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny,negative
so im giving it a,negative
and maybe that is too generous,negative
right from the opening credits i knew that i had a classa bomb on my hands,negative
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform,negative
i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening it does get explained later and as soon as the first scene is over we cut to a completely unrelated scene,negative
to be honest as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film,negative
with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film it wouldnt have surprised me if the opening had never been explained,negative
so what is this movie about,negative
you ask,negative
like it really matters,negative
ok here goes,negative
this allgirl band headed by kelly macnamara dolly reed and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry,negative
once there they do manage to find success due as much to their hooters as anything else it sure wasnt for their brutally bad singing voices and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them,negative
everything from big egos to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral,negative
there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing,negative
from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here,negative
other than the abovementioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have,negative
the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts,negative
mr ebert has generously thrown in helpings of hey man dig and my all time favorite this is my happening and it freaks me out,negative
now i ask you with lines like that how can you go wrong,negative
ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue,negative
maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter,negative
i dont know but all the big words in the world wouldnt be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting,negative
but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie,negative
ive seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey,negative
in fact there is one scene the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries,negative
add to the directing and writing the music in this movie,negative
i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers,negative
then we have the cast,negative
first lets start david gurian who played harris the manager of the band,negative
this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera,negative
sadly his acting doesnt come close to making up for his looks,negative
if you have been following along up to this point this shouldnt surprise you,negative
meyers stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets,negative
dolly reed plays kelly the leader of the band,negative
and no surprise here she was cast for her cup size not her talents,negative
and yes she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents,negative
sadly her ass is almost as large as her chest,negative
hey it a sexist movie so im writing a sexist review,negative
then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey one of the other band members,negative
this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie,negative
meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all,negative
sure russ now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows,negative
on the up side she does have a fun lesbo scene,negative
i sound like im writing a review in a porn magazine,negative
but hey ill admit it the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked,negative
and since that was a huge disappointment i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey,negative
the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it,negative
unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too,negative
and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double ds you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet,negative
this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs,negative
an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls beware this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense,negative
proceed with extreme caution,negative
vampires is a rude chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse present only to pleasure men feed vampires readied to be bashed or beaten till ones sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie,negative
to make matters worse the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks and deserve to have their heads bitten off if not their bodies carved in half,negative
the dilemma of hating the heroes as much as the villains makes one wish that the hand of god would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion,negative
james wood portrays jack crow a man obsessed with killing vampires whose soul reason for living is based on revenge they killed his parents but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires,negative
as for adam baldwin he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex,negative
as for the claims that the catholic church created dracula well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame,negative
an awful movie on all counts my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent rude vampire slayers,negative
ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his or her sophistication,negative
its full of stops and starts and usually the punch line is ruined,negative
i felt the same way watching drowning mona,negative
skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy,negative
there are some slightly successful attempts at humor but they only serve as window dressing,negative
there is a running gag about the town verplanck n y being a test town for the then new yugo,negative
everyone drives a yugo differentiating their cars with personalized license plates,negative
even the police chief drives one,negative
there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets,negative
there also is a running gag about one of the characters jeff missing a hand and how it occurred,negative
it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends,negative
it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend,negative
there are some sight gags that pop up as well such as monas tombstone which reads demoted instead of devoted,negative
still the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond,negative
the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona midler,negative
each scene with her is the same scream at someone hit someone then scream some more,negative
theres no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness,negative
anyone off the street could have played the role such as it is,negative
the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts,negative
each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization,negative
there is a burly female car mechanic so of course there is a forced lesbianism gag,negative
monas son jeff marcus thomas is a simpleton hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth,negative
chief of police rash devito likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter,negative
theres nothing more to him,negative
elle the chiefs daughter campbell is bland personified a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married,negative
monas husband phil fichtner jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch,negative
bob affleck elles betrothed and business partner to jeff is a mumbling obvious dullard,negative
there is no contrast to any of the characters,negative
by having at least one character with some wit or wits to serve as counterpoint to the others perhaps steinfelds attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better,negative
ostensibly a murder mystery drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer who could be anyone due to monas loving manner with everyone on town,negative
even that aspect of the film fails throwing in a convenient ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things,negative
its been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood,negative
what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at its ineptitude,negative
michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky goofy best friend to jeff daniels lawyer character in this illfated and unfunny comedy,negative
plot richard the actor richards has to take the place of charles the lawyer daniels in a real court case after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party,negative
the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery,negative
critique this movie did not make me laugh once,negative
perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it,negative
perhaps,negative
perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld,negative
perhaps,negative
perhaps it was because the movie just wasnt funny,negative
absolutely,negative
the lack of humour wasnt the only issue that i had with this film either,negative
the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision but unfortunately they are also lacking in conviction believability and credibility,negative
they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake,negative
the actors were all adequate enough in their roles but the problem didnt lie in the acting,negative
i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time but i cant,negative
unless of course you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house,negative
overall this movie stinks,negative
on the good side charlize theron is darn cute and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes,negative
on the bad side this movie is not funny interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible,negative
a person wouldnt even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness,negative
please skip it,negative
little known facts jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becoming an,negative
charlize theron grew up on a farm outside benoni south africa as the only child,negative
at the age of 18 her mother made her go to los angeles to try a career in the movie industry,negative
she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card,negative
after eight months in la she got her first part,negative
since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed specifically in devils advocate 810,negative
charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the movie showgirls,negative
she was quoted as saying it was like i had some guardian angel,negative
susan grangers review of two can play that game screen gems,negative
since the success of waiting to exhale there have been several romantic comedies about africanamerican professionals,negative
this female revenge fantasy vivica a fox plays shante smith a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success a mansion a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky hotshot lawyer morris chestnut,negative
shes at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girlfriends monique wendy racquel robinson tamala jones,negative
when your man messes up no matter how small it is she smugly decrees yuh gots to punish him,negative
so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival gabrielle union she devises her own version of the rules a 10day tough love emotionally punishing plan to get him back,negative
unfortunately mark brown how to be a player breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy you have to like the protagonist and shrill selfcongratulatory shante smith is a smirking superficial spiteful shrew who doesnt realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love,negative
having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the day one day two titlecard device underscores the tedium,negative
comic anthony anderson scores as chestnuts boisterous bestfriend and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic whos given a smooth makeover by ms robinson,negative
but the outtakes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 two can play that game is smarmy if slick 4 filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements cocacola miller genuine draft but little else,negative
in this rrated for explicit sexual language pseudohip battle of the sexes the audience loses,negative
theres nothing new under the sun is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means lets find something to copy,negative
of course there are very few completely original ideas,negative
even earthshattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience,negative
there is after all no need to reinvent the wheel time after time,negative
recently it seems that hollywood doesnt feel the need to even rewrite the script,negative
my understanding of the word sequel is a continuation of the story,negative
the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes,negative
have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalmas adaptation of the steven king novel,negative
this is your dream come true,negative
rachel emily bergl a high school outcast is beginning to notice weird things happening around her,negative
doors slam shut by themselves,negative
glass globes blow up,negative
her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent,negative
a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out,negative
the incrowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event,negative
any of this sound familiar,negative
once the audience catches on that this is the same story as carrie theres little to do but wait for the inevitable ending,negative
the effects are a bit better this time around but the film doesnt work nearly as well,negative
there are a couple of minor plot differences,negative
rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized,negative
the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original,negative
they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest,negative
and uh there must be other story changes but none stand out,negative
one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell,negative
over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie,negative
now a high school counselor she befriends rachel but her characters potential is squandered,negative
theres too much about sue that doesnt make sense,negative
after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachels mother is in,negative
still living in the same small town the woman with a wellknown history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor,negative
sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease,negative
this may be the one original idea in the film but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a disease is never explained,negative
sues eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldnt figure out what to do with her,negative
blink and youll miss it,negative
some of the events are filmed in black and white but the rationale for this is unknown,negative
it doesnt add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random,negative
the rage retains some of the trappings of carrie without the meaning,negative
in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carries onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating,negative
here theres an abundance of red but for no apparent purpose,negative
the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin,negative
one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds,negative
the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original,negative
seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film and the flaws in this one,negative
the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic,negative
finding an allstar cast for such a film is a stroke of genius,negative
combining all that with a threetime oscarwinning director robert benton of kramer vs,negative
kramer and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment,negative
in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood how many of these have we seen during the past few years,negative
the atmosphere is moody the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere,negative
over70 harry ross paul newman is a washed up copturnedprivate eyeturned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life,negative
hes screwed up things pretty well i had a wife and daughter,negative
now im a drunk and is at a crossroads,negative
a couple of years ago he traveled to mexico to bring back mel reese witherspoon the underage daughter of jack gene hackman and catherine susan sarandon ames and now lives with them,negative
the ames are former movie stars past their prime and the three have become fast friends,negative
one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up,negative
to fill his time he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine,negative
jack is in even worse shape than harry,negative
hes dying of cancer with only a year to live,negative
things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him,negative
instead of the routine errand that ross expects he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another excop who is himself full of bloody holes,negative
this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherines first husband 20 years before,negative
through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder blackmail guns mels mexico traveling partner and his parole officer rosss former cop buddies exlover and wouldbe sidekick the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to,negative
its a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about,negative
the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario,negative
by the time they show you it doesnt matter,negative
the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in rosss relationship with rubin giancarlo esposito a partner wannabe,negative
these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief however they are neither,negative
rubin and ross have some past relationship but either its not explained or i didnt care enough at that point to remember,negative
a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform,negative
its also not funny doesnt connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course,negative
on the positive side its often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen,negative
the three leads all have welldeserved academy awards and turn in accomplished if not extraordinary jobs,negative
newman is a grand actor but doesnt seem quite suited to the dark film style,negative
he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out,negative
hackman also lowkey is believable but lacks sparkle,negative
sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is onedimensional,negative
the actors do what they can with lame dialog but they cant pull the film out of the hole its dug for itself,negative
james garner who plays rosss old buddy excop raymond hope is always a treat but even he halfheartedly struggles through lines like im glad they didnt shoot your pecker off,negative
the best part of the film is the look at old friends how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make,negative
the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen,negative
the film doesnt run very long before the audience realizes that its hopeless,negative
the only reason for watching is the actors,negative
it reminds me of disaster movies such as towering inferno where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the films problems,negative
in a better world there would have been secondrate actors in this secondrate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better,negative
of course we dont live in that better world but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie,negative
synopsis lifelong friends rafe affleck and danny hartnett join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor hawaii,negative
rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action,negative
danny falls in love with rafes girlfriend evelyn beckinsale but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend,negative
meanwhile the japanese sneak attack is imminent,negative
review pearl harbor is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art,negative
it is little more than a crasslycalculated attempt to woo the masses enticing them with big stars big effects and a big setting but no heart,negative
it is difficult to criticise the actors because they do everything the movie demands of them,negative
sadly this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing pearl harbor with his left,negative
the plot here is pure cliche and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop,negative
there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii,negative
instead there is just an assemblyline love triangle some empty patriotic rhetoric and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders when one intones i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant i nearly fell out of my seat,negative
to the movies credit it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war,negative
if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill perhaps this memorial day nonevent would have been worth watching,negative
how do you judge a film that is so bad but intentionally so,negative
in spiceworld the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it,negative
if that was their goal they did a fantastic job,negative
so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasnt really meant to be much better than this,negative
honestly id rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades so does that mean i graded it inaccurately,negative
truth be known i dont really think i can answer this question,negative
to understand spiceworld you have to understand the spice girls,negative
unless youre very very young or fairly older you probably have at least heard of them,negative
theyre a group of five busty british babes whove had 1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions,negative
theyre primarily adored by preteen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spices real name geri haliwell wonderbra,negative
all five of the girls have these spicy names for which they are better known than their real names,negative
there is the aforementioned ginger spice as well as sporty spice melanie chisholm or mel c scary spice melanie brown or mel b baby spice emma bunton and posh spice victoria addams and all of them to some degree or another resemble their stage names,negative
the spice girls took the world by storm and spiceworld is actually a good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame,negative
its quite nice to see what good sports the girls are and not just the one dubbed sporty about poking fun at themselves,negative
they dont take themselves too seriously and thats probably the best thing about them,negative
its also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera acting and not just singing and dancing,negative
theyre not flawless by any means but for the most part they deliver their lines without feeling staged and like them or not we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters which seems reasonable since they portray themselves,negative
what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls wont get enough of their music while the rest of us dont get enough of a movie,negative
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes,negative
most of the film is very blas but several parts are downright boring and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud,negative
if youre a big fan of the group you probably wont get enough of what you want and if youre not a big fan you get too much time devoted to nothing more than look at us moments,negative
for the right crowd the music video sequences will be the highlights of the film but for others they will serve as threeminute lulls in a hecticbutoveralluneventful storyline,negative
other key actors include richard e grant as clifford the spice girls manager alan cumming as the filmmaker piers cuthertonsmyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group george wendt as martin barnfield a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie and roger moore in a small selfparodizing role,negative
all provide relatively good performances keeping in mind once again that this film wasnt meant to be acted seriously,negative
even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it,negative
while this film is continuously compared to the beatles a hard days night i think that is an unjust comparison,negative
it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits but i dont think drector bob spiers nor the spice girls intended it to be so,negative
i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film and have instead come off rather pretentious,negative
i dont think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun satirical look at a group that got so big a movie seemed the next likely step,negative
and what couldve been better than a selfindulged yet self mocking approach,negative
probably nothing and so it is,negative
spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy but now instead i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didnt even give a good review,negative
its bad but it succeeds in every way it intended,negative
it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment,negative
perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick,negative
if thats the case the movies gimmick is that it is such a gimmick,negative
you might be saying a spice girls movie,negative
come on but when it comes down to it i think thats the point,negative
barb wire pamela anderson lees first foray into films highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets,negative
being the only notable member of the cast the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity making her characters catch line dont call me babe sound very ironic indeed,negative
from the very opening of the movie we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe,negative
throughout the movie there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage if not of andersons then at least of the female extras,negative
this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire,negative
for a plot barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline,negative
it is 2017 the middle of the second american civil war and barb wire a former resistance fighter runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead,negative
known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazistyle uniforms,negative
in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town past the governmentcontrolled areas and to freedom,negative
even the airport looks like the one in casablanca except that the plane in the background is a modern private jet,negative
there are hardly any significant moments in this film and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of barb wire,negative
if anything one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts,negative
who could fight and jump in a skimpy strapless leather top and yet keep her breasts from spilling out,negative
only a stuntwoman,negative
not pamela anderson lee,negative
what do you get when you ripoff good movies like woody allens bananas and martin scorseses after hours,negative
youd think youd get the best of both films,negative
instead you get woo,negative
falling in somewhere between def jams how to be a player which was awful and booty call which was ok woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing africanamericans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons,negative
the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours as wild woman woo jada pinkett smith goes out on a blind date with straightlaced tim tommy davidson,negative
mayhem follows them,negative
for some unknown reason read contrived screenplay davidson puts up with all of woos antics for the entire night which include her destroying his bathroom mirror stealing things from his house violently questioning him accusing and belittling him actually about previous girlfriends causing a riot in an elegant restaurant and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldnt tolerate,negative
but for the sake of this bad movie,negative
sure why not,negative
there are a few chuckles in the film the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas,negative
in this case davidson is running from thugs gets into a subway car as the doors are closing starts to taunt the thugs then the doors open back up again,negative
a good joke but a stolen one,negative
another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams cameo as himself,negative
movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so and not one of them has ever been a hit,negative
woo wont be one either,negative
so why was it made,negative
and more importantly isnt there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive,negative
everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point,negative
r,negative
this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash,negative
this is more about a parable of greed and how money can become the bane of your life,negative
yes there are elements of fargo here the snow and cold although not as vivid in the blood and gore department,negative
it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives,negative
and how at the end of the day the things that matter most are love truth and honesty,negative
although in one sense it may seem tedious making a movie about the ugliness of greed not box office material it does become tedious not because of the morale ending but because one expects the movie to end that way,negative
this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there,negative
the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk brothers and friends who all fall prey to the avarice of money,negative
they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance,negative
commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful,negative
bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife who indirectly causes the most problems,negative
fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath,negative
its not a simple plan when you shoot everyone you love for money unless youre the menendez brothers,negative
spawn may be somewhat of an older film,negative
in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasnt seen it will finally get to see it that is if they see it,negative
but i managed to catch it before it made its way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing,negative
it wasnt the worst film of year by any means,negative
it isnt even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year,negative
but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which in simpler terms means it comes in at number 6 on my worst of 1997 list,negative
the only reason it doesnt come in lower is thanks to the special effects which might actually have been some of the best of the year,negative
performances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy,negative
in fact this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness,negative
even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality,negative
i dont know how to explain that one it wasnt exactly choppy but something about it seemed,negative
well annoyingly unprofessional,negative
john leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite,negative
he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional,negative
but the main problem i found with spawn as with most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring,negative
i wouldnt even say there was a climax to the film,negative
sure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion,negative
never too soon the movie did conclude in a very simple disappointing way,negative
even though its one of the shorter movies ive seen this year its one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again,negative
like i said the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride no matter how small,negative
i was impressed with the opening sequence so long as i didnt allow the melodramatic voiceover and lobotomizing editing to get to me,negative
and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawns outfit created,negative
but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes which looked quite a bit like a modern video game,negative
who knows if spawn the video game wasnt part of the plan from the beginning,negative
keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in a very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all,negative
but none of this movies saving graces can it make it something id recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission,negative
this movie is definitely not for young children which shouldnt really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing,negative
if you really want to catch a movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be,negative
trust me,negative
spawn has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers,negative
its almost amusing to watch 21year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potters followup to 1997s the tango lesson the man who cried,negative
the geny actress with her cold stare and big black eyes has appeared in an impressive range of films but she doesnt even come close to being the bold heroine the film set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 requires her to be,negative
ricci whose character is shockingly silent and blank showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett quite an amusing sight to behold,negative
blanchetts lola a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie is bold interesting and layered everything our heroine lacks,negative
costar of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe,negative
the actress inhabits the role as she always so remarkably does with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the films lead rather than her dull companion,negative
important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film these landmarks serve as the films little conflict,negative
obviously the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues,negative
the man who cried has many aspirations none of which come full circle by the films close,negative
there are forced messages here and there go forward always go forward lola preaches to suzie theres romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitlers nazis the gypsy cesar johnny depp who like ricci barely gets to speak lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it and at the core of all these devices lies suzies desire to travel to america where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago,negative
the films main problem is that potter isnt skilled enough to tell the epicsized story of suzie,negative
the time periods instability the conflicting social classes the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life serving as both writer and director potter throws in some of each but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any,negative
by the time the sighinducing climax hits the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater,negative
the films falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely are we really meant to believe any of this could happen,negative
contrastingly in its moving final scene the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film,negative
although its apparent that potter cant grasp what she reaches im puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place,negative
riccis suzie is meant to be the films core from the extended flashback at the films beginning to the quickly drawn ending everything seen in the film in some way relates to her,negative
so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals,negative
the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble but not present enough for the film to be riccis,negative
the almost constant lack of flow and onenote tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha viernys beautiful cinematography that renders the films various locations wonderfully,negative
also worthy of note are lindy hemmings costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely,negative
and then theres the music,negative
from minute one to minute ninetyseven theres hardly a moment when the wavering skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music dont undercut the action the notes stricken both overwhelm particularly john turturro portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio whose money and reputation catch lolas interest and accompany oftentimes the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the films characters and reinforce that state,negative
potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note unfortunately the same effort isnt given towards almost everything else,negative
these days we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old cult tv shows,negative
most of the times the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past,negative
but some five or six years ago there werent that many movies and the trend didnt look that depressing,negative
so the people who like the author of this review grew up watching flintstones popular 1960s animated series about modern stone age family werent particularly worried when the word came about live action remake,negative
after all the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and if anything else at least the special effects would be good,negative
the plot revolves about flintstones family set in fictious stone age town of bedrock whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america,negative
fred flinstone john goodman works in the quarry and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble rick moranis and his wife betty rosie odonnell to adopt a baby,negative
to return the favour barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred and based on that fred gets wellpaid job in management,negative
but of course this is just a sham corrupt official cliff vandercave kyle maclachlan and his sultry secretary sharon stone halle berry need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme,negative
in the meantime freds wife wilma elizabeth perkins must face her mother elizabeth taylor who cant stand fred,negative
on the superficial level the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life,negative
computer effects are flawless and the costumes settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show,negative
unfortunately problems with this film start with inadequate casting rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie odonnell,negative
but the greatest problem of all is plot or to be precise the lack of plot,negative
some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame original characters onedimensional and many elements of the story like embezzlement and interoffice politics totally incomprehensible for the little children the main targeted audience of this film,negative
result is almost unwatchable mess occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as high concept,negative
after great hype movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version,negative
all in all film isnt that bad but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it,negative
synopsis a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar,negative
the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary while his wife disapproves,negative
meanwhile a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession,negative
comments why is this movie called possessed by the night,negative
its hard to speculate,negative
most of this film takes place during the day and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky pulsating bubbling brain thingie in a jar,negative
in case you havent picked up on this yet possessed by the night is a bottomofthebarrel thriller i use the term thriller loosely here which is really cheap and bad,negative
the plot which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s actually serves one purpose to exploit nude women as often as possible,negative
writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging,negative
theres really not much to say,negative
the acting is lousy although occasionally the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience,negative
most humorous is frank sivero who plays murray the novelists agent,negative
he is so horrible in this role that one cant help but be amused,negative
the plot sucks,negative
nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole,negative
the dialogue stinks,negative
a loan shark for instance tells another how much he loves bimbos which is something the audience really doesnt need to know,negative
everything about possessed by the night is second rate even the film credits,negative
as the names of the notsotalented film crew scrolled by at the end joseph scales came up credited as being assistsant to foley artist,negative
someone could have used an editor,negative
to be honest the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes,negative
playboy playmate shannon tweed after all is the star here,negative
i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing he would like this movie,negative
why did i give this turkey two stars and not one,negative
as a bad movie it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film,negative
if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night however id recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else,negative
please dont mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam i,negative
just want to warn all of yall not to waste your hardearned on anaconda,negative
its not even worth a 99cent video rental,negative
dont listen to ebert on this one he has no clue what hes talking about,negative
btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was required to watch it on assignment she reviews movies for a local paper,negative
now ill actually back up my huffing and puffing,negative
here goes,negative
movie anaconda rydains bottom line wait for it to come on usa up all night,negative
even then i doubt its worth the price of jolt to help you stay up that late,negative
why do i hate anaconda,negative
let me count the ways,negative
first of all this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong,negative
as an ophiophile snake lover i can tell you that a anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet b theyre scared of people c cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snakes mouth and constrictor snakes dont kill what they cant eat d people can outrun snakes with no trouble especially heavy ones like anacondas e if an anaconda did eat a human it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal therefore it couldnt run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast and f snakes have no vocal cords so they cant make funny squealing noises,negative
whew,negative
i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it,negative
unfortunately anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel,negative
my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end,negative
anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually,negative
that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didnt give up and fall asleep,negative
he was the most likable character in the movie,negative
who wouldnt enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman,negative
anaconda did have its cute moments arguments between ice cubes character and the british guy for instance,negative
however those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twentyeight minutes of boring schlock,negative
the writers had and blew a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines,negative
i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny,negative
did she retort with a clever egowithering comeback,negative
of course not,negative
im trying to work,negative
gee thats even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with,negative
she could have told him to go find a knothole or something,negative
p but i will admit there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome hint it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks,negative
as for the plot im still trying to find one,negative
this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous computergenerated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the fasterthangravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet,negative
harrier snake,negative
not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims,negative
the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense in which the sick guys gfriend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him,negative
that was about as clear and understandable as mission impossible,negative
if someone could explain that movie to me id be most grateful,negative
all the oldguy double agents looked the same,negative
i wasnt inspired by the acting save for the evil dude,negative
i cant blame the actors though,negative
its not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with,negative
this concludes rydains diatribe on a shameless exploitation and perpetuation of public fear of snakes,negative
comments flames anyone,negative
rydain the atomic cheese fresh from chernobyl dairies,negative
when i was nine i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store,negative
masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures they combined science fiction and fantasy had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read,negative
of course the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history,negative
given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon not to mention its moderately successful spinoff shera princess of power it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together come with the result of trillions and make a liveaction masters movie,negative
lets be blunt masters of the universe is a very bad movie,negative
the story is painfully dull and mindnumbingly cliched hands up who wouldnt guess heman and skeletor take their fight into the real world and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors dolph lundgren as heman for one or good actors james tolkan meg foster given such awful characters and dialogue that they cant help but seem terrible,negative
it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars,negative
we have the alien bounty hunters the desert skif technology stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that deja vu is too polite a term to use in describing it,negative
blatant uninspired ripoff would appear more appropriate,negative
tv fans might want to check out courtney cox monica in friends and robert duncan mcneill lt paris in star trek voyager very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either,negative
so in the face of such mindless submediocrity is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all,negative
yes there is,negative
one incredible good reason,negative
his name is frank langella,negative
langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood appearing in countless films over the years,negative
here he plays skeletor the villain of the piece,negative
dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face he is one part darth vader one part emperor and two parts grim reaper,negative
given this character langella falls right into it with style and precision,negative
skeletor is believable interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right,negative
masters of the universe,negative
i remember loving it when i was eleven,negative
at twenty one its difficult to see why,negative
but as i said it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder,negative
besides this year marks the films 10th anniversary,negative
watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate,negative
plot summary the year is 2024,negative
the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod,negative
the shield although saving lives has made the atmosphere hot and humid,negative
connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope,negative
on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a terrorist organisation,negative
they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up,negative
connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist like zeitget it,negative
they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off,negative
he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland,negative
both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment,negative
connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield,negative
katana meanwhile fearing connor would return sets out himself to kill the highlander,negative
if you have never seen it,negative
being a fan of highlander and mr connery i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii the quickening,negative
i wish it had been quicker,negative
i feel whatever else you can say about a film bad script bad music etc if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said,negative
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so the time mr connery is on the screen for is worth watching,negative
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance,negative
maybe they could pull it off,negative
instead i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film,negative
its as if they are different people with the same names,negative
witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance where is the attitude of who wants to live forever when love must die gone to,negative
the love subplot must have had footage cut out,negative
the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before,negative
putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying,negative
i still want to know why connors coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal,negative
we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill,negative
why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck,negative
i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first,negative
to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the worlds worst shot,negative
meanwhile connor develops lukeskywalkerlike powers of laser beam deflection,negative
as for bad guys we see a rebellion on zeist crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist,negative
two assassins are sent presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems,negative
no more assassins are sent,negative
katana supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor,negative
has he no more assassins,negative
has he no better,negative
why was the rebellion crushed so easily then,negative
michael ironside is totally unconvincing bring back the kurgan,negative
he seems like a cartoon character and really isnt that evil just stupid and violent,negative
we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents,negative
yet he still seems like no threat perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor or maybe because his two best assassins wouldnt have been amiss with larry curly and mo,negative
so much for plot and characters,negative
the music is atrocious,negative
it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying,negative
bring back queen,negative
there was an audible sigh of relief,negative
when connor played a queen track in a juke box,negative
i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release,negative
the acting is at best flat except for mr connery,negative
lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered there can be only one this time around it just made me wish there had only been one highlander,negative
michael ironside is unconvincing sorry michael i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable,negative
so why 210,negative
visually the film is interesting at all times,negative
it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning,negative
add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film or is he smirking to himself,negative
his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey id have done it for 12 million,negative
oh and i agree with a previous reviewer she does look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film,negative
incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii the wizard,negative
i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film,negative
i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach,negative
throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof,negative
well have a hit on our hands,negative
the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film a mishmash collage of onedimensional characters rampant stereotypes of cultures and races cliched emotional statements of purpose and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography,negative
the story is loosely based around the pro football players strike in 1987 and a ragtag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels,negative
keanu reeves stars as shane falco a hasbeen football college player looking for redemption,negative
gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers,negative
rounding out the cast includes swingers jon favreau 7up pitchman orlando jones gruff owner jack warden and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters the drunken welshman the overweight sumo wrestler the black convict the violent cop and the dumb dumb cheerleaders,negative
this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from dennys,negative
the usual things happen like clockwork,negative
the hero rises from the ashes of failure the team comes together in unity the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax,negative
its also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks,negative
howard deutch who was behind the camera for two of the best films of 80s pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes,negative
obviously the problem is that without a good script any director will fail in the end,negative
sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds the rise and fall of gallant heroes and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life,negative
the replacements offers none of this,negative
i think maybe its time for the batman series to be put to rest,negative
not only has the first two films unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a superhero been abandoned but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for allout camp with few traces of the selfmocking restraint of the relatively lighthearted third installment,negative
let me give you an example in the first scene of the movie batman george clooney and robin chris odonnell are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger in an attempt to steal a diamond,negative
mr freezes thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks but this is no problem for our heroes automatic skates shoot out of their shoes at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick grabs the diamond and stickhandles it through the museum,negative
i might have expected this from an airplanestyle farce but i dont think thats what this movie is supposed to be,negative
after all the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the genre and kept the corny deathdefying stunts to a minimum while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony,negative
not any more the list goes on and on in this one,negative
robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 000 feet high in the atmosphere climbing in the door to save batman,negative
mr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond,negative
a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old heman cartoons,negative
my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl alicia silverstone gets in a race with motorcycle thugs during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her,negative
not bad but wouldnt the police or maybe batman,negative
notice if the road was on fire,negative
i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place but,negative
it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment,negative
as if three protagonists and two villains werent enough batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce waynes butler alfred michael gough which might have seemed poignant if it wasnt surrounded by so much silliness as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruces girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie,negative
all this might be semiexcusable if the story were interesting and entertaining but it isnt,negative
in fact its kind of boring,negative
mr freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholsons joker and danny devitos penguin,negative
their evil plot is as predictable schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words today gotham city tomorrow the world,negative
as it is lamebrained didnt it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too,negative
and robins constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bullheaded and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place,negative
strip away the stars the fancy set design and the status as a batman movie and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick,negative
gord brody tom green is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim rip torn and julies julie hagerty airplane basement,negative
as dad declares all out war gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true,negative
gord doesnt make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in freddy got fingered,negative
tom green cowrites with tom green show scribe derek harvie directs and stars in what is essentially tom greens primal scream,negative
so if tom green screams in an empty theater does he make a sound,negative
its clear that freddy got fingered is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks,negative
while this may be of interest to his hard core fans theres little about greens mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else,negative
the film starts promisingly enough with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols problem greens put together a first rate soundtrack and yes i laughed a few times,negative
greens flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw make music and eat at the same time the daddy would you like some sausages scene repeatedly shown in the films trailer are inspired comedy,negative
but whats funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap,negative
a baby delivery bit shows some groaninducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs,negative
younger by three years brother freddys internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm ones worst fears regarding the films title and greens infamous handling of a real horse while not nearly as shocking as it would seem doesnt make sense,negative
by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at films end the overall effect is numbness,negative
while freddy got fingered has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a childs self esteem its essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy,negative
rip torn what were you thinking,negative
at the end of an action scene in lara croft tomb raider a wall collapses near the nubile warrior,negative
with her face on the floor she gazes into the rubble then grins abruptly and says oh my car keys,negative
i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile,negative
based on an incredibly popular video game lara croft tomb raider is a lousy movie,negative
the structure goes like this poorlystaged action sequence boring exposition poorlystaged action sequence boring exposition etc etc the end,negative
basically the film exists to showcase angelina jolies puffy lips and enhanced tits,negative
closeups are framed ohsocarefully to include her million dollar bazooms,negative
running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage baywatch fashion,negative
theres even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them,negative
but the filmmakers are so inept they cant even flash the audience correctly,negative
the one extended display of nudity is of get ready for this a guy,negative
for no particular reason a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds with each shot composed to barely cover his package la austin powers,negative
now i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy but what the hell is beefcake doing in a ta flick aimed at heterosexual males,negative
of course what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right,negative
tomb raider sets up elaborate action set pieces then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts,negative
it promises a series of exotic locales then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies,negative
throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons,negative
intended to be a rousing indiana jones style adventure tomb raider lacks any sense of tension,negative
the low point comes when lara is threatened by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multiarmed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi,negative
easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun,negative
if you ever have to be chased by monsters pray that you get the monkey warriors,negative
tomb raider tells a story sort of,negative
once every 5 000 years the planets align,negative
a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that if reassembled just as the planets align will give them control over time itself,negative
laras goal is to stop them and rescue her longmissing poppa jon voight jolies real life dad,negative
none of this matters though because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of lara croft tomb raider is as lame as ever other aspect of the film except angelina jolies lips and breasts,negative
say tell me if youve seen this before a crisis onboard a commercial airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly and land the plane herself,negative
airport 97 anyone,negative
ray liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from new york to california on christmas eve,negative
amazingly on what would seemingly be a busy day of travel on one of the most flown routes only about six other passengers are on the flight,negative
anyway they take off liotta escapes and kills all the police and the pilots and stewardess lauren holly locks herself in the cockpit to fly the plane,negative
the story is beyond routine the script is embarrassing at one point this jumbo jet is flying completely upside down the characters are worthless and the performances are annoying,negative
surprisingly cowriter steven e de souza actually wrote the first two die hard movies,negative
turbulence takes place at christmas time yet the film was released a few days after the holidays,negative
brilliant marketing as no one cares about anything having to do with christmas after december 26th,negative
the studio knew they had a bomb and purposely dumped it out when the fewest number of people would see it,negative
r,negative
by starring in amy heckerlings clueless two summers ago alicia silverstone proved she wasnt just another pretty pouty ingenue showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of the crush out of the water,negative
her only work since that 1995 gem has been in junes batman robin where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl,negative
now shes the star and producer of excess baggage a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an illcomposed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level,negative
silverstones emily t hope is stuck with a billionaire father jack thompson who neglects her emotionally,negative
in an outlandish plan to gain his affection she fakes her own kidnapping emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw,negative
but before the police can rescue her professional auto thief vincent roche benicio del toro jimmies the locks hotwires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily whos still trapped in the back,negative
when vincent discovers emily the two dont exactly hit it off she annoys him he annoys her and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner harry connick jr he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there,negative
along the way of course they get into a whole heap of trouble and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky felonystudded situation,negative
it doesnt help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops crooks and even her shady uncle ray christopher walken whos wise to his nieces ploys for attention and has mafia connections,negative
for at least a halfhour excess baggage bounces along fast and efficiently,negative
during this time emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice rolereversal twist shes an awfully aggressive combative victim and hes quite the aloof seemingly vulnerable captor,negative
but once its past its setup the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once,negative
a road movie a teen comedy a mob thriller a drama about family relationships you name the cliche and excess baggage likely covers its territory,negative
of course a romance develops between the two leads but it all seems forced and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome,negative
do you like my tummy,negative
emily coos to vincent at one point in the film,negative
huh,negative
did i miss something,negative
the hardedged foulmouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting googoo eyes,negative
then again excess baggage becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise,negative
a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles but the movie isnt game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded,negative
motivations keep shifting resulting in an often confusing narrative,negative
scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions,negative
excess baggage has too many characters too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand,negative
i loved silverstones turn in clueless as an aloof pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austens emma,negative
looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there its simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for excess baggage,negative
sadly however excess baggage is no clueless,negative
but on the other hand it is clueless,negative
capsule not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman robin but still horribly putrid cheesy and illconceived,negative
this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons,negative
extended review you know about halfway through this movie i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes youd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy hong kong style martial arts,negative
beautifully choreographed by robin shou who also plays liu kang the fight scenes are both mindblowing and graceful acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep,negative
this is what made the original so fun but unfortunately for the sequel we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson,negative
instead they got john r leonetti the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat,negative
not a good choice,negative
while the fight scenes are brutal and eyepopping the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare,negative
the acting is subpar which i could endure if it were not for a the directors style b the special effects c the treatment of the story and characters,negative
a mr leonetti should go back to lighting in my opinion,negative
i could say dozens of bad things about him he way overuses slowmotion he has no eye for action he cant get even mediocre performances out of actors and so on,negative
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping,negative
apparantly everybody can now fly,negative
hell im all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot but not when it happens every few minutes and is done so poorly,negative
better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena warrior princess,negative
in short they should have gotten paul anderson back,negative
or at least let robin shou direct,negative
b unlike the first one whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic mk as special effects are bland fake looking and overall just plain bad,negative
i counted at least half a dozen times that bluescreening was painfully obvious,negative
had this movie been made in the 80s it would have been groundbreaking,negative
but in todays industry it doesnt even look finished,negative
c now for the really bad parts,negative
i admit im an avid fan of the mortal kombat series,negative
the games are amusing diversions an easy way to work off stress and anger,negative
the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride,negative
this could have been a really cool movie,negative
it isnt,negative
the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers,negative
some of the plot elements are just plain stupid,negative
how stupid,negative
take for instance how our heroes move around,negative
they use giants spheres the roll around underground supposedly at thousands of miles per hour oh,negative
boy,negative
even worse is the treatment of secondary characters,negative
blink and youll miss em,negative
most characters had more depth in the video games,negative
if you thought batman robin was bad about this you aint seen nothin yet,negative
a good 75 of the characters are introduced kick somebody around a bit then either die or are forgotten about,negative
theres no explanation at all for this,negative
and for the final blasphemy the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of ended,negative
it almost made me weep,negative
to sum it all up rent it on video and fastforward through everything except the fight scenes,negative
john boormans zardoz is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own,negative
not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d wood jr has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time,negative
of course woods career can be explained by two things he had no money and he had no talent,negative
boorman on the other hand cannot court such excuses to explain zardoz or his followup film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic,negative
boorman obviously had a sizable budget a matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldnt know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent,negative
this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance 1972 as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory 1987 the slightly overconceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the fatherson jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985,negative
his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste,negative
if boorman is anything hes ambitious and when he succeeds its in grand fashion,negative
unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around,negative
zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boormans,negative
his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz a book which figures into the movies plot,negative
but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling,negative
the events take place in the distant year 2293 but there is little of the typical futuristic movieness to be found,negative
in fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting oldstyle guns and living in large victorian mansions,negative
its more middle ages than space age,negative
the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life,negative
these immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in a sort of quasiutopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society,negative
however if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years,negative
if someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals,negative
one of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed,negative
like the wizard of oz he adopts a godlike status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head,negative
this flying head is one of the movies opening images and its a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come,negative
calling himself zardoz frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they cant procreate and take up more resources,negative
from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laughinducting statements like the gun is good,negative
the penis is evil,negative
that line alone is worth the movies cult following,negative
one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardozs flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex,negative
once there the immortals label him a brutal and study him like a lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is a mystery to them,negative
they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantilyclad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up,negative
i say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is,negative
it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward he didnt get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming,negative
just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper a mane of hair braided halfway down his back a wyatt earpstyle handlebar mustache and a pair of thighhigh patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker,negative
boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would greenlight this effort,negative
he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor,negative
sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace,negative
he got exactly that in zardoz and its a wonder it didnt end his career,negative
im sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements,negative
is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life,negative
is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing,negative
or is it a social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates,negative
karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary,negative
come to think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip,negative
people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy,negative
when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions i turned to my friend and said dangerous liaisons for kids,negative
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece,negative
imagine my surprise to see that roger kumble has given credit to his source material choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits,negative
and i was impressed,negative
in fact i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film which is an appalling excuse for a movie,negative
its kiddieporn hackwork complete with earthy sextalk and fullyclothed handjobs,negative
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable with all the teen highschool angst movies coming out there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think theyre smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined,negative
cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to i hated all the characters and i hate everything they do,negative
i also hate ryan phillippe so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be,negative
phillippe plays check out this name sebastian valmont,negative
wow,negative
isnt that a memorable name,negative
i could just say it over and over again,negative
sebastian valmont,negative
it kind of rolls off the tongue in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich,negative
sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth there is no woman he cant have no material object out of his reach,negative
he has all the money all the sex all at his fingertips,negative
and luckily his parents never enter into his life no in the world of cruel intentions adults dont really exist,negative
the ones who do are irritating,negative
sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar the bitchqueen of the universe and also the woman every man wants,negative
since these two rich kids are so bored they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons,negative
kathryn wants sebastian valmont to devirginize cecile caldwell selma blair a naive dorkchick who has somehow wronged kathryn,negative
but its too easy for sebastian valmont he wants to nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon the paradigm of chastity and beauty,negative
so sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal which is too explicit to state here,negative
but dear god,negative
sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove,negative
dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable and because of its masterful acting,negative
cruel intentions is bad for many reasons but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting,negative
kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her,negative
she is supposed to be mean but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons,negative
gellar while aesthetically pleasing is onedimensional and utterly repulsive,negative
witherspoon has a truly beautiful face but her character isnt the moral staple shes supposed to be sure she wont have sex until shes in love is this really a moral issue but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible,negative
but i cant forget mr phillippe who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable invulnerable blandness,negative
i have to give him credit and say that he did in fact manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions,negative
and theres one point in the film in which he shouts thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone,negative
true he is bad but it doesnt help that he has no character to work with,negative
kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character leaving us with a sexcrazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch,negative
the film fails in every other way too,negative
first of all nobody talks like this,negative
even the intellectuals i know dont bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering,negative
for a while the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs but it ends up taking itself so seriously that theres no way we can join it,negative
cruel intentions also manages to come off as softporn in more than one scene,negative
earlier i mentioned a fullyclothed handjob this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie,negative
so if we hate them then whats the point of an extended sex scene,negative
titillation of course,negative
it cant even work under the pretense of meaningful love scene because we hate the characters,negative
its interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons,negative
kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film many of the scenes have a similar tone and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely such as the last scene in which spoiler warning the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers,negative
but kids dont act like this,negative
nobody acts like this,negative
in his translation roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy some pretty crucial elements,negative
the result is a picture of confounding badness a kiddieporn mess that thinks its really deep and profound,negative
ill give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences but that doesnt change the fact that its awful,negative
the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie but alas no caped crusader descends to save this film,negative
instead its a skeletal housemaid julia roberts who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of dr,negative
jekyll and mr hyde,negative
for a few fleeting maddening moments director stephen frears dangerous liaisons gets everything just right the tone the colors the characters all the ingredients to make a mostpowerful potion out of valerie martins bestselling novel,negative
yet it fizzles too quickly the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene,negative
casting is a large part of the problem,negative
the story all but collap ses around ms roberts she doesnt have the range for this kind of drama,negative
her accent also comes and goes though its nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and costar john malkovich,negative
he looks the same in both of his roles an incredible fact thats missed by everyone in the story,negative
the very british supporting cast including michael gambon and george cole gives credibility to the smaller parts,negative
glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon,negative
her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and as a bonus offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the liveaction 101 dalmantions,negative
the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense there is none,negative
no terror no tension nothing,negative
without any weight wit or wonder to propel the story the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail a few buckets of blood and stuart craigs fabulously dreary production design,negative
all of which gets old after about an hour at which point i recommend leaving,negative
the pacing in the secondhalf is especially abominable,negative
if you do stick it through your sole reward is a halfhokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation,negative
mr frears reportedly recut his film several times missing several release dates in the process,negative
obviously no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks,negative
blucher,negative
mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month after muppet treasure island,negative
perhaps mr frears should consult with brian henson on future projects,negative
i daresay that even ms piggy is a better choice for a certain roles than julia roberts,negative
and she does have a great chop,negative
when the mediums in question are video game and feature film has there ever been a respective heretothere transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodleheaded mediocrity,negative
super mario bros street fighter and mortal kombat were silly stinkers all and now the empty execrable wing commander joins their lowly ranks,negative
enduring this spectacularly bad bit of scifi easily the worst of its kind is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes that is to say theres little fun to be had when youre not the one holding the joystick,negative
the movie then is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts who created the original groundbreaking pc incarnation of wing commander back in 1990,negative
how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a headscratcher,negative
wing commander s story credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas,negative
it rips off the finest films of its genre top gun and in one scene even those spiffy stereoscopic freeze gap commercials,negative
set in 2654 wing commander stars freddie prinze jr as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him,negative
along the way he plays kissyface with his stoic superior saffron burrows at the new galaxy hangout where hes posted comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his pilgrim heritage dont ask and goes on a topsecret mission involving the jump coordinates what no death star plans of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi,negative
or something like that,negative
given the immensely confusing activity its hard to tell,negative
on the other hand whats easy to see is that wing commander is a big old mess,negative
the lame dialogue strains filled with such original lines as dont you die on me,negative
battle stations,negative
and repeated and frequently unanswered calls for a medic,negative
action sequences fizzle,negative
the character conflict garners unintentional giggles,negative
the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like as theyre kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes,negative
imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a 50s roger corman cheapie and youve got a good idea,negative
little but technobabble happens for an hour and then its as if wing commander tries to do too much at once when it appears as though the movies about to show signs of a pulse it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before,negative
matthew lillard featured prominently in said sequence is cast as prinzes hotshot partner and though the two are fine young actors recently paired in the hit shes all that theyre fighting more than otherworldly evil here,negative
rumor has it that wing commander was slated as a laterintheyear release bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new star wars episode i trailer,negative
but in my audience there were no females present to make googoo eyes at prinze or lillard and many a member exited after the muchballyhooed sneak peek,negative
since most cineplexes wont be granting refunds to the latter contingency commander might rake in some dough but be warned the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation,negative
years ago robin williams made jumanji a brilliant achievement in special effects but a travesty on nearly every other level,negative
the same can be said for what dreams may come a boring illogical weepiewannabe that left my senses numb,negative
dont get me wrong i love breathtaking special effects and pulsepounding imagery,negative
brazil is on my personal top ten,negative
the city of lost children is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios,negative
i even love 2001 and last year at marienbad being in the minority amidst my friends,negative
what dreams may come imagery aside has little daring thought to complement its imagery,negative
the daring thought it does have is never fully realized,negative
its idea of a plot is so lukewarm that it insults the bigger questions it raises,negative
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences put on an electronica soundtrack and sell it as one of those popular minds eye videos,negative
robin williams plays chris nielsen who dies too prematurelynot only in the story but before we have a chance to really know and care for him,negative
the director vincent ward and the screenwriter ronald bass have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife,negative
big mistake,negative
it would have been far better to take the halfhour or so needed to tell his life story first ala its a wonderful life so that i can build up respect for him so i could know and possibly care for him his children and his longsuffering wife played superbly by annabella sciorra,negative
instead the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses,negative
it doesnt,negative
so in the afterlife chris learns that a people still dont meet god b that our thoughts are reality and c time does not exist there,negative
hmm,negative
ill grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative,negative
the not meeting god part still irks at me but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect,negative
that said this alternate reality still makes no possible sense,negative
read on,negative
chris wife commits suicide,negative
since suicides go to hell chris would be separated from his wife forever,negative
the important question is is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love,negative
good question,negative
and i like good thoughtprovoking questions,negative
i dont like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question,negative
i loathe it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously,negative
i really loathe it when its story is no longer run by logic but by special effects,negative
hey chris did you forget,negative
your thoughts are real,negative
they are more real than the physical world according to the newage screenplay,negative
so why dont you conjure up positive thoughts of annie and let that run wild,negative
and then she would appear before you and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity,negative
because there would be no movie thats why,negative
and albert the angel played by miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly thats fantasy,negative
umm,negative
if your thoughts are more real than the physical then fantasy is not fantasy but real,negative
surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that,negative
and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person and that your thoughts arent big enough to sustain you for eternity well in all due respect thats why i dont subscribe to this theology,negative
all due respect,negative
another idea based on time pause does not exist here,negative
so chris spend your eternity with annie as she is on earth reliving your favorite memories or hang out with her when she was growing up,negative
youve got eternity perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out,negative
and forcing her to write i still exist in her diary imo is just too tacky,negative
there are many other ideas all of which are a hundred times better than whats unraveled in the plot,negative
the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before and just come out stale,negative
most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris life appear in heaven differently than he expects so when they finally show themselves he realizes they were with him all along,negative
and when this happens the film runs in slow motion as if to build emotion,negative
gag me with a spoon,negative
so the only things for me to like are sciorras effective performance who rises far above this mundane material and the special effects,negative
please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals i did not enjoy all of them some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating up and down in invisible strings,negative
it sounds like a joke but its really true i really tried to block out the dialogue and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack,negative
my vote goes to a rare cd called never say die 1981 from petra a christian rock group,negative
its pretty good and they have a song about annie who commits suicide,negative
its too late for s gone away for s so much wed have told now we wish we its too late,negative
melancholic yes,negative
depressing yes,negative
but far more entertaining,negative
so in case you dont know let me be straight,negative
suicidebad,negative
dont do it,negative
no no no got it you,negative
shouldnt have to pay 7 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest,negative
it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch,negative
based on the late 1960s television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover,negative
however things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion,negative
of course the ads make it seem like so much more,negative
quick cuts cool music claire danes nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like,negative
sounds like a cool movie does it not,negative
after the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not,negative
the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production complete with nice hair and costumes but that simply isnt enough,negative
the film is best described as a cross between an hourlong cop show and a music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half,negative
and with it comes every single clich,negative
it doesnt really matter that the film is based on a television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything weve already seen,negative
the characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden,negative
claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored which really transfers onto the audience,negative
the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching,negative
unfortunately even hes not enough to save this convoluted mess as all the characters dont do much apart from occupying screen time,negative
with the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset,negative
despite an american r rating which the content does not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset,negative
information on the characters is literally spoonfed to the audience would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable,negative
the way the film progresses you likely wont even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because youll know they arent,negative
basing the show on a 1960s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one thats missing a finger or two,negative
the number of times that i checked my watch six is a clear indication that this film is not one of them,negative
it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teenflicks that weve been seeing as of late,negative
avoid this film at all costs,negative
this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be one of the hottest writers in hollywood,negative
he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream 810 then added the successful i know what you did last summer 7 510,negative
script to his mix and also created the popular tv series dawsons creek,negative
so when he asked to direct his first movie based on his first ever script written everyone and their grandma said sure go for it,negative
uhhm my question is did anyone bother reading this stupid script,negative
plot ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west mrs tingle and set to lose her scholarship to college,negative
when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story they end up tying her up and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman,negative
critique its not so much that this is a bad movie than the fact that it sucks,negative
this movie is chockfull of onedimensional characters contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on zero tension or thrills plot holes the size of my big ass lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie and molly ringwald vivica a fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles,negative
i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery 810 and 9 to 5 but unfortunately for williamson he went nowhere with the bright foundation making references to the exorcist and dr,negative
zhivago which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate,negative
he also forgot about suspense with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue,negative
sure katie holmes is cute and her costar marisa coughlan did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist worth two points out of my three on ten but how can we forgive the biggest onedimensional character in any film holmes rival in the film mrs tingles complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays and a transparent romance between holmes and some longhaired dude hired to be the poor mans version of skeet ulrich who himself is a poor mans version of johnny depp,negative
all in all this movie was laughable for me provided me with no insight into anything demonstrated williamsons genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability humanity or capacity to comprehend,negative
no hip lines no cheap thrills just a dull time at the movie theater,negative
if you want to see a funny teenage movie go see detroit rock city 810 and thank my drunken sorry ass in the morning,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars kevin williamsons father was a fisherman,negative
kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer 7 510,negative
he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally so is dawson leery on tvs dawsons creek a show kevin created,negative
he was once an aspiring actor,negative
in fact he even landed a bit part on tvs another world,negative
also williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs tingle which is also loosely based on the book killing mr griffin by the writer of i know what you did last summer 7 510,negative
lois duncan,negative
he has also come out and said that he is a gay man,negative
helen mirren was born in london england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff,negative
she is married to director taylor hackford whose works include devils advocate 810 and an officer and a gentleman 8 510,negative
this film was originally titled killing mrs,negative
tingle but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident,negative
actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called wasteland,negative
this is actor barry watson first full feature film,negative
he has played the character of seth on tvs malibu shores several times,negative
in the first death wish movie mildmannered new york architect paul kersey played by charles bronson was avenging the death of his wife,negative
in the second he was avenging his daughter,negative
in the third he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend,negative
fourth movie on the other hand begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen played by kay lenz,negative
however since this is death wish movie we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for,negative
this time karens teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways,negative
kerseys new targets unlike the previous movies arent the ordinary street punks but rich heavily armed and wellconnected drug dealers,negative
even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support and it comes from the publisher nathan white john p ryan determined to avenge the drugrelated death of his own daughter,negative
whites plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them,negative
the plan begins to take shape but kerseys actions bring attention of two police detectives reiner george dickerson and nozaki soon teckoh,negative
fourth and unfortunately not the final installment in the death wish series will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade,negative
however although some critics might argue death wish 4 the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 paul kersey one of the most intriguing and potentially controversial characters of the 1970s is still being dumbed down by mediocre script and charles bronson really doesnt feel the need to put much effort in his acting,negative
however the hand of a veteran director j lee thompson seems more capable of michael winners and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring,negative
there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end,negative
the script even tries to fake some social conscience through criminally underused kay lenzs character and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years,negative
there are even some halfhearted attempts of humour both intentional and unintentional like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronsons 1970s classics,negative
special note to xphiles mith pilleggi the actor who plays ad skinner in the x files could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman,negative
movies can do the two big es very well educate and entertain,negative
in the best of all possible worlds they accomplish both,negative
on the red planet they fail entirely,negative
in the near future a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth,negative
this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be,negative
after some mumbojumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does,negative
the ground crew of people you couldnt care less about is trapped on the surface without food water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog,negative
the one potentially interesting character carrieanne moss spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer,negative
attempting to graft 2001 esque space mysticism with terminator robot horror first time director antony hoffman cant seem to figure out whats going on,negative
neither can we,negative
didnt he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story,negative
couldnt he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter,negative
there are so many missteps,negative
every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction,negative
why introduce the theme of faith vs science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die offscreen,negative
the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen,negative
two hours later theyre still waiting,negative
despite our greatest hopes there is no life on the red planet,negative
capsule five friends at a stag party are involved in the accidental killing of a prostitute,negative
the coverup attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends two wives and several innocent bystanders,negative
this was a real audience pleaser at toronto but it did not do much for me,negative
low 0 4 to 4,negative
directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland,negative
five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them,negative
one of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute,negative
several people with no moral compass,negative
they started out with a simple innocent little cocaine party and by accident look what happened,negative
they have one moral person among them daniel stern and one totally amoral person christian slater,negative
it is more selfish to let the amoral lead so they do,negative
this film is strange but not really funny or biting,negative
black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange,negative
there should be some element of satire,negative
the satire is missing here,negative
i did not find myself laughing here either,negative
what we have is a strange crime tale,negative
one just does not care what happens to these people,negative
the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently,negative
if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation,negative
it begins like diner particularly with daniel stern and ends up like an extended comic book,negative
there are several logical holes in script,negative
if a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappears wouldnt the guests he was investigating be the first suspects,negative
someone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work,negative
i am desperately trying to avoid making this a spoiler,negative
popular and situation ethics get a real slamming,negative
some acting of grief is hammy and overdone,negative
more yelling than humor,negative
plot a rich guy who doesnt believe in love orders a mailorder bride for himself,negative
that very evening the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter,negative
but whats this,negative
one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be,negative
wow a,negative
sin indeed,negative
critique easily one of the worst movies that ive seen all year,negative
too long too boring too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie,negative
what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing,negative
its no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week with some nudity stuffed in from time to time just to wake up the audience,negative
have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies one that you just couldnt help but switch back to from time to time just to make sure that it wasnt part of some sick joke,negative
well this movie is exactly like that only it isnt a joke it isnt on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it,negative
i say again what the shite were they thinking,negative
okay so where do i start,negative
first of all the trailer of this film gives away the movies main plot twist the betrayal,negative
so for the first half hour of the film youre basically just sitting there watching these two lovers go through the motions until the betrayal occurs,negative
whoopee big surprise,negative
second of all angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part,negative
why,negative
well its like this not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman,negative
i mean its like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining well the same goes here,negative
every look in jolies eyes screams psycho,negative
then of course you have the case of the patsy husband a man who just cant seem to figure out anything in time,negative
i mean how,negative
boring is that for the audience,negative
youre watching this guy screw up time after time after time and somehow were supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude,negative
no thanks,negative
and if we dont care about him and we really dont care about her shes a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film,negative
well ill tell you,negative
the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not id actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled,negative
no suspense no chemistry between the leads no real love or passion no sense of surprise plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending,negative
so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points,negative
well its actually pretty simple,negative
i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolies boobies thats two points right there and another one for antonios ass hairless just for the record,negative
everything else in this movie was pointless boring and just plain stupid,negative
try imagining a softporn movie but,negative
without the plot,negative
thats pretty much what youve got here,negative
a low point in the careers of both stars,negative
oops i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue god,negative
oh mighty make,negative
it stop,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
american psycho 910 cruel intentions 810 eyes wide shut 610 fatal attraction 810 playing by heart 710 under suspicion 710 what lies beneath 810 what women want 410 whipped 710,negative
ripe with explosions mass death and really weird hairdos tsui harks double team must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jeanclaude van damme needs another notch on his bad moviebedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career,negative
actually in double team neithers performance is all that bad,negative
ive always been the one critic to defend van damme he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars namely steven seagal never aim for its just that hes never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994s timecop,negative
and rodman,negative
well hes pretty much rodman,negative
hes extremely colorful and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t even if the role is that of an excia weapons expert,negative
its the story that needs some major work,negative
van damme plays counterterrorist operative jack quinn who teams up with arms dealer yaz rodman to rub out deadly gangster stavros mickey rourke all beefy and weirdlooking in an antwerp amusement park the job is botched when stavros son gets killed in the gunfire and quinn is taken off to an island known as the colony a think tank for soldiers too valuable to kill but too dangerous to set free,negative
quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife natacha lindinger but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her,negative
so whats a kickboxing mercenary to do,negative
quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman kill stavros save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do,negative
with crazy often eyepopping camera work by peter pau and rodmans lite brite locks double team should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure,negative
but too much tries to happen in each frame and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated,negative
the numerous action scenes are loud and headacheinducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about whats going on in the movie,negative
and much of whats going on is just wacky,negative
theres a whole segment devoted to netsurfing monks that i have yet to figure out,negative
and the climax finds quinn going headtohead with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinns baby boy whos in a bomb equipped basket all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers,negative
did i mention double team is strange,negative
when it all comes down this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity,negative
rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona though leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs,negative
but we didnt need double team to tell us he could do that did we,negative
in 1989 director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama glory but since then he has made continuous disappointments to me at least with 1994s legends of the fall and 1996s courage under fire,negative
those two films werent bad just not very good but with zwicks latest film the siege he has finally made one,negative
the siege is a modernday actionthriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city,negative
investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard denzel washington and frank haddad tony shalhoub who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it,negative
later a bomb goes off in a broadway theater killing even more,negative
they soon meet cia operative elise kraft annette bening who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist,negative
there are some movies that simply dont need to be made and the siege may very well be one of them,negative
oh sure zwick thinks he is making a meaningful action film since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than say die hard which also starred bruce willis,negative
this time willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u s army who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax,negative
whatever points the siege earnestly tried to make were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen or maybe zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place,negative
the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical just as women were in the recent john caprenters vampires by placing them all in the category of bad guys,negative
the siege contains three fine actorswashington bening and shalhoubbut washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development,negative
bening has slightly more to do and has an intriguing character to work with while shalhoub pretty much steals the show even though again he has no real character,negative
by the climax of the siege with washington giving a sermon to willis on the socalled message of the story i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to on deadly ground in which steven seagal gave a 10minute speech at the end about preserving the environment,negative
the siege is constantly heavyhanded not entertaining or insightful and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay,negative
capsule an insult,negative
a stupid and incompetent movie that doesnt even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable,negative
weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes,negative
money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
its not simply idiotic its contemptuous of its audience,negative
it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely,negative
its a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here,negative
its not even fun as trash,negative
woody and wesley star maybe thats not the right word as new york city transit authority police,negative
they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie one of them plays drunk possum to attract chainsnatchers and the other does lookout,negative
i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this raised by a documentary id seen on the subject once but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thoughtprovoking,negative
see if you can follow this,negative
they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the money train the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books is parked,negative
the guards on the train see this kid running at them lift their machine guns shout halt,negative
and then open fire when the kid doesnt stop running at them,negative
blam the kids dead,negative
then woody and wesley show up and of course the other ta cops hate them why and a pushing match starts and someone gets decked and i covered my face,negative
id seen enough,negative
ive never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy systematically any chance of being credible or interesting,negative
fed up with the bs at their job most of it their own goddamned fault woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train,negative
hence the title in case some of you all two of you didnt figure it out yet,negative
then theres this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks and a love story and a holdup no two holdups sorry easy to lose track in a movie this braindead and a mob boss who wants his money,negative
there wasnt a minute when i gave a horses ass about any of it,negative
neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute,negative
we do not care about them,negative
they are not interesting,negative
they are noisy loud stupid foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy,negative
they deserve to get shot or run over as the case may be,negative
they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was written into a movie like white men cant jump and which simply does not exist here,negative
they are idiots and were expected to root for them,negative
bullcrap,negative
the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture,negative
what exactly is this mess,negative
a cop movie,negative
police procedure is not given a moments genuine thought anywhere,negative
a thriller,negative
the subplot with the token booth killer is inept a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite,negative
a comedy,negative
the few jokes that do work are wasted,negative
a drama,negative
all dramatic tension between both principals is freezedried and offtherack,negative
theres not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk its all screenwriterese that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of fourletter words,negative
actual dialogue excerpt fuck you,negative
what,negative
you heard me fuck you,negative
no fuck you,negative
look ill be honest here,negative
ive tried writing screenplays and even i suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess id get laughed out of the office,negative
anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch because god knows i know i can do better,negative
ive weasted enough time on this piece of tripe,negative
way of the gun is brimming with surprises some good most bad,negative
one of the good ones is ryan phillippes surprisingly halfway decent performance,negative
after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer he hinted at a bit growth in last years cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how hed fallen for his target,negative
it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the films director could negotiate,negative
but he seems to be trying and that shouldnt be overlooked or probably over praised seeing as how at this point he really isnt required to do much but look pretty,negative
here phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his look here see glory,negative
its tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass but his performance actually helps with the illusion,negative
unlike ben afflecks puppy dog approach in reindeer games phillippe is believable and not too bad at that,negative
as for the plot well thats one of the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that shes carrying the baby of painter scott wilson a very well connected wealthy man,negative
the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed,negative
but the antiheroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain in pursuit,negative
directed by christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles this one included way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity,negative
unlike phillipe mcquarrie doesnt seem to be growing at all he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know ive seen before and worse it feels like it,negative
the film lacks even a fresh approach like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey to its clich s all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is,negative
it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life,negative
even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life philosophy etc i didnt like the bit much when it first appeared in heat here its even more self consciously dramatic,negative
usual suspects which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending,negative
nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential,negative
thus nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and it too has an ironic little twist at the end nothing earth shattering like in the usual suspects but i admit i didnt see it coming and i smiled,negative
however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason,negative
or substance,negative
its just as overplotted as suspects and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters a distinctive style or a good script would be,negative
even the good stuff most of which involves james caan doing a fine job feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like karma is only justice with out the satisfaction are clever,negative
at one point caan laments need is the ultimate monkey a line so inexplicable he might as well have said love is like hippo ass,negative
ive seen porno with better dialogue,negative
and some with better plot lines too,negative
but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast i mean can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy,negative
caan slips into this role with seeming ease he could do this kind of softspoken tough guy in a coma but he manages to give his character depth and weariness,negative
benicio del torro is always welcome though here he plays it fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage adopting a brad pittesque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering,negative
speaking of pitt his ex juliette lewis is a weak link either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness or waddling about like a silly goose,negative
nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted hes only kept around for his cold presence,negative
taye diggs has a similar function cool as ever but never a character though the guy has one helluva death scene,negative
for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippos ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns,negative
its vaguely tarantinoish but in a bad truth and consequences nm way with phillippe in one scene leaping into a stupid rant about faggots migrating to los angeles,negative
you know the routine,negative
the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at,negative
but those gun shots sure crack like thunder,negative
just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant gruntlike sound that emanated from harrys fetishized smith and wesson,negative
oh how far weve come,negative
the last line or near to that honor is the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying i think we need a bigger bat cave or something to that note,negative
thats exactly what this film is too big for its own good because it has too damn much,negative
cut batgirl out,negative
cut one of the villains,negative
its too much to handle in one dosage,negative
its so much that characters get left behind,negative
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way shape or form,negative
and elle deserves better,negative
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher,negative
its also the fourth worst in the series and second worst from joel,negative
the series has been declining since its stunning debut followed by the almostasstunning sequel and then the anticlimactic third one first by joel,negative
this ones not anticlimactic i knew it was gonna suck,negative
its up to joel to make it fun though,negative
batman forever was fun,negative
this is a big bore of overproduced action sequences and shallow characters,negative
i mean this one bit,negative
im gonna put all the plot in one paragraph mr freeze ahnold whos wife was dying of some disease has become the new big villain these days,negative
hes a huge exscientist who fell into some weird liquid hello,negative
joker and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body,negative
batman george and robin chris fight him a bit but find theyre growing apart,negative
meanwhile another villain shows up poison ivy uma who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out hes used her research to develop an uberman bane who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had,negative
she emerges from her chemicals dont ask cause i cant tell ya as a sexy woman the real uma whos poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people,negative
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo,negative
meanwhile alfreds dying of the same disease mr freezes wife has but in an earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon it takes her 2 hours becomes batgirl,negative
meanwhile in an unfinished subplot bruce batmans alterego if you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing,negative
end of her for all we know,negative
mr freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population dont ask,negative
the trio must team together as family to beat them,negative
there ya go,negative
not the whole story but no big context clues,negative
too much right,negative
right,negative
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels,negative
however while tim burton nicely balanced the storyline although not wonderfully joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one,negative
he gets some corny speeches a couple clever lines and thats it,negative
maybe some stunts,negative
for all this i cant even comment on george clooney as batman i hardly saw the guy,negative
and when i did he had horrible dialogue to say,negative
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode,negative
george is in between them,negative
hes not quintessential hes not horrible hes good,negative
but im sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since theyll be critically murdered for this sorry effort well get a good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job,negative
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher,negative
last time we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey,negative
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze,negative
we feel bad for his collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants,negative
arnold isnt very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points,negative
when he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber,negative
wow,negative
but uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness,negative
its like shes almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points,negative
shes incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better,negative
as for the lower batpeople chris is the same as he was in batman forever although i think his work in these is too hokey when hes best at quieter parts in scent of a woman or just plain cool parts in fried green tomotoes,negative
alicia i love the girl but shes not particularly good in this film,negative
she can hypotheitically act we all saw that in clueless but her lines kinda sound weird,negative
and it isnt the mushymouth this time,negative
but in all fairness she has virtually no part,negative
joel gets around to her occasionally and when shes on she does stupid stuff although,negative
i know im not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma,negative
and poor elle,negative
poor poor elle,negative
i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those of us who saw sirens,negative
but she has no part,negative
it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product,negative
there are no couch scenes like my best friend noticed,negative
now listen to me on this one in every batman flick theres a couch scene,negative
in the original it was with vicki,negative
in returns it was a good makeout scene with selena,negative
and in the last one it was a chat with nicole,negative
this one its nothing,negative
and batgirl does nexttonothing in this film till the end when shes suddenly part of the family,negative
fortunately we get a lot of alfred,negative
hes the always reliable butler in case you didnt know who has been with bruce all his life,negative
hes a god,negative
hes a father figure,negative
hes also dying,negative
this got to me,negative
i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe not in his tux and freaking dying just gets to me,negative
we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time but,negative
this is never answered as this film is too cluttered,negative
but in defense it does have some good parts other than uma,negative
for one george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do,negative
and there are some nice touches,negative
when they show the asylum at one point they show the patients belongings in a room and we see the riddlers costume,negative
i laughed,negative
and during a biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but a bunch of badasses dressed as droogs from a clockwork orange,negative
i laughed at all these,negative
the film falls apart around the fiveminute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes or,negative
did it just feel like that,negative
the film should serve as another in the longline of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays,negative
people are fed up with stupid films,negative
thats why the word of mouth killed the lost world,negative
thats why last year indy films grossed more than ever,negative
thats why this will have a strong boxoffice initative from people who just want to see it like me but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it,negative
thats why the next two bigbudget aciton pics are john woos and barry sonnenfelds men in black both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on,negative
i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste,negative
i like some of his films flatliners a time to kill but a lot of them suck,negative
hes a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and thats what makes him great,negative
but his costuming for woody allens sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number,negative
i love the batman series,negative
the first two rocked and i did like the last one,negative
but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three,negative
hopefully this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time,negative
and maybe theyll get smart and bring back catwoman,negative
and michael keaton,negative
but we can only hope,negative
there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space its just that none of them happen to be actors,negative
the stars im referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movies outer space the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home,negative
yes in terms of acting the star power is,negative
well more like a falling star,negative
kinda pretty shortlived and pretty much dead,negative
lost in space as if you really didnt know is based on the 60s scifi television series of the same name,negative
its the year 2058 and earths precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population,negative
john robinson william hurt is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet,negative
earths entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission but nobody whether it be johns family or hired battle pilot don west matt leblanc seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years,negative
johns family consists of his wife maureen mimi rogers his atypical teenage daughter penny lacey chabert his ingenious son will jack johnson and his beautiful scientist daughter judy heather graham,negative
despite everyones reluctance the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space,negative
unknown to anyone but the audience there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission,negative
dr smith gary oldman has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour and dr smith has reprogrammed a talking robot to destroy robinson family,negative
when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination and now the premise of being lost in space is complete,negative
as for the audience you will likely be lost in boredom by this point wondering if the plot like the jupiter 2 will ever get off the ground,negative
its hard to tell who deserves the most blame the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script,negative
chabert is basically the only one to overdo it sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium,negative
if you like me were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens youre wrong,negative
thats just her normal voice,negative
in yet another example of a friend faltering on the big screen leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming make sense it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod,negative
graham is a babe thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film,negative
hurt the black hole of excitement sucks up any energy that might have been left,negative
if hurt were available in tablet form he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill,negative
johnson isnt dull hes just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybodys ass all the time,negative
want an example of how cool this kid can be,negative
how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family,negative
hey dont laugh the thing actually listened to the mr rogerswouldbeproud sentiment,negative
but alas if you thought a character couldnt be much worse there was rogers as the epitome of generic or mother as she was known,negative
why hire an actress,negative
they couldve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it,negative
now that wouldve had some pizzazz,negative
lost in space luckily doesnt suffer in every single category that it could have,negative
the special effects are crisp clear and at least mildly captivating unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse,negative
unfortunately oldman is locked away for most of the film giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy,negative
while the special effects are pleasing to the eye they are nothing you couldnt find in most modern scifi films,negative
contact for example far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination,negative
lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art with numerous contradictions the time travel aspect was horribly flawed wooden and corny acting worse dialogue and an ending so disappointing youd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens,negative
then again with an ending like this film has its obvious a sequel is already being considered,negative
what an awful note to end on knowing there could be more of this in a year or two,negative
the attempt to be family oriented is commendable but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups,negative
well danger potential movie goers,negative
danger,negative
this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity,negative
according to popular film opinion a films greatness is determined by time,negative
take for example casablanca,negative
great film even today,negative
its still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic,negative
another example would be star wars which had a very very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before,negative
but as i rewatched independence day when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 i kinda felt like it wasnt as cool as when i had first seen it,negative
i had liked it when i saw it the first time was my original view and basically saw it as a good escape film,negative
but when i rewatched it i felt cheated,negative
thus the curse of the event film,negative
independence day is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once except for a couple kids the critics in this situation,negative
but after a while this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one,negative
well this kid is the event film in my little analogy,negative
and when i rewatched independence day not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen but i felt insulted the whole time,negative
there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just arent sure if its comedy or hokey drama,negative
one scene youll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch the next youll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around saying corny lines,negative
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of glen or glenda,negative
now this annoying kids problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once he shows he has no balls,negative
and independence day has no balls,negative
it plays it safe everywhere,negative
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films,negative
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of star wars,negative
i mean isnt that devils den,negative
and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moores breasts in striptease,negative
theyre these octopus men boring freaking octopus men,negative
i mean come on,negative
the aliens in 2001 were more interesting and you didnt even see them,negative
basically the plot is straight from a bmovie from the 50s aliens come to earth and we wonder if theyre hostile or peaceful,negative
okay its an interesting topic but its not handled greatly,negative
now they arent and somehow a computer geek jeff goldblum figure out theyre using our satellites as a countdown to destruction,negative
yep,negative
these aliens are not only heavily armed theyre stupid too,negative
they also use the same kind of computer as we do but that comes about later,negative
the president bill pullman whos under attack for being a wimp decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent and he decides hell stay in the white house which the aliens have covered,negative
i dont care if its bob freaking dole in the white house get him out of there,negative
i dont care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol just get him out of there,negative
later on hes stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship,negative
i think its time for impeachment for this guy,negative
hes more senile than reagan on pot,negative
then theres a cocky pilot will smith who is the only person to survive the counterattack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 the films only sign of being brave,negative
his girlfriends a stripper sharing a subplot with striptease in that she has to do it for her son,negative
come on she has a fighter pilot tobe fiance,negative
i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers,negative
shes also the few the proud the lucky to survive the igniting of l a as well as her dog who narrowly survives,negative
there are some bright spots,negative
they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing,negative
the best one is when jeff goldblum nicely named david turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says good morning dave,negative
and they even played r e m s,negative
its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine at the beginning,negative
and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great hes a stereotype but i just loved the man anyway,negative
but there are no real subtle comic moments,negative
will gets way too many oneliners and he has no one to play off of execept jeff towards the end and the two do great,negative
as i said this film has no balls,negative
it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and thats what it is,negative
but after a couple months we all move on to the next event film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure,negative
but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime,negative
this ones short on batteries,negative
girl 6 is in a word a mess,negative
i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film,negative
there was no sense of where the film was going or any kind of coherent narrative,negative
if there was a point to the film i missed it,negative
girl 6 by the way is the way theresa randles character is addressed in the phone sex workplace all the girls are known by their numbers,negative
the plot such as it is theresa randle is a struggling n y actress and eventually takes a job as a phonesex operator,negative
she begins to lose contact with reality as her job consumes her,negative
also she must deal with the advances of her exhusband isiah washington,negative
he is an ex con thief and she tries to keep him away while at the same time its clear that she still harbors feelings for him,negative
her neighbor jimmy spike lee functions as the observer mediating between the ex husband and girl 6,negative
he also functions as a point of stability as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex,negative
the soundtrack consisting of songs by prince was jarring,negative
it kept taking my attention from the film not altogether a bad thing ill grant you as what was transpiring onscreen wasnt that riveting,negative
for parts of the middle of the film the music stayed blissfully in the background,negative
in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film however the music was particularly loud and distracting,negative
of course ive never really cared for princes or tafkap if you like music,negative
prince fans might love the soundtrack but it will probably be distracting even to diehard fans,negative
of the performances the only one that stood out was spike lees buddy character jimmy,negative
he was excellent as the alwaysbroke neighbor of girl 6,negative
he should have stuck to acting in this film,negative
there are several sequences that gave me the impression that hed like to be oliver stone when he grows up,negative
there are scenes shot with different types of film which are purposely grainy and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stones natural born killers,negative
in that film they worked to propel the narrative,negative
in this film they just made me more confused,negative
there are some amusing moments and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phonesex industry the multibillion dollar industry that it has become,negative
other than that though nothing much happens,negative
there are a few intense moments as when one caller becomes frightening but even that is rather lackluster,negative
im not the biggest fan of spike lee though id agree that he has done some very good work in the past,negative
in girl 6 though he seems to be floundering,negative
he had an interesting idea a fairly good setup and seemed to wander aimlessly from there,negative
girl 6 earns a grade of d,negative
plot a downandout girl moves in with some overthetop models and falls in love with a goofybutloveable guy from across the street,negative
aaaaaaaaah,negative
then one day she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat,negative
ooooooooh,negative
she must then join together with her modelfriends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofybutloveable or a psycho killer,negative
aaaaaaaaah,negative
critique completely idiotic,negative
okay so maybe im being a little too nice,negative
this movie starts off dumb moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy,negative
there thats,negative
more like it,negative
and how you may ask,negative
well its simple really,negative
four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world oh my god i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life yipes,negative
join monica potter in a role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help and freddie prinze jr not the actor but the character better known as freddie prinze jr in a plot so stupid and farfetched that you have to wonder once more how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs,negative
this thing stinks to highheaven,negative
its just plain embarrassing for everyone involved,negative
i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this socalled romanticcomedyaction movie,negative
ugh,negative
what a pile of dung,negative
hey im actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time,negative
its sad really,negative
a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy including the overused folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart gag,negative
and how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things,negative
pure hilarity,negative
or maybe im just too jaded too much of a critic not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluffpiece uuuhhmmm naaaaah,negative
this movie sucks the big one,negative
its chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot,negative
this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because well,negative
its supposed to be funny see,negative
you see that person then has their legs swinging in the other persons face as they drive and that distracts the driver see and well thats kinda funny no,negative
harumph yeah,negative
well you,negative
get the picture,negative
anyhoo freddie prinze jr nuff,negative
said,negative
monica potter a bad career move but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit,negative
the rest of the model girls well,negative
thanks for being there so i had something to look at but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole for making them all out to be complete imbeciles,negative
so why the three points out of ten you may ask,negative
well its simple really,negative
one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent dont ask me why but it actually turned me on,negative
one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie nice window decoration natch,negative
and one last point goes out to the makers of this film who spared us any long sorted story and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage so that we could run out as fast as we can grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is freddie prinze jr i,negative
mean head over heels,negative
youve been warned good people,negative
ps didja notice how i didnt even mention rear window once in my entire review,negative
i didnt want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing but then again i just did mention it but i guess it doesnt count in the ps section or,negative
does it,negative
ooooh whatever i have a headache,negative
i think my brain is coming back to life,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
10 things i hate about you 710 coyote ugly 6 510,negative
down to you 6 510,negative
save the last dance 710 shes all that 6 510,negative
the wedding planner 410 youve got mail 5 510,negative
when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie,negative
however since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt,negative
however the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played by lynch,negative
however the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap,negative
so he begins his own private war against gio trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt,negative
in the process he meets gios mistress gina zamora played by rosie vela and starts relationship with her too,negative
although it doesnt stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine,negative
nobody in this film actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke,negative
the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too,negative
however this isnt reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would in most likelihood forget the next day,negative
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,negative
be forewarned,negative
to assess alex coxs film the winner as a loser would be so indolent,negative
it would be derisive,negative
it would be glib,negative
it would be dismissive,negative
it would be entirely accurate,negative
rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner a wouldbe comedy which quickly proves to be tedious unfunny and unengaging,negative
the film attempts to be fresh and quirky utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous,negative
the film is set in las vegas and the focus in the winner is on philip vincent donofrio an aloof naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck he virtually cannot lose at the tables,negative
despite this prodigious talent philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities,negative
consequently he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent,negative
louise rebecca demornay a sultry lounge singer insinuates herself into philips life for the purpose of swindling him while philips estranged brother and conveniently louises exbeau johnny michael madsen arrives on the scene,negative
to add some colour johnny also happens to be toting their fathers corpse sans one hand,negative
meanwhile philip is also befriended by a trio of lowrent opportunists frank whaley billy bob thornton and richard edson who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddys gift with the dice,negative
serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner delroy lindo it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorseses casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casinos operations he is the eye in the sky,negative
it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation but fortunately this is not the case in the winner if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap not even remotely sympathetic or compelling it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate and the wouldbe swindlers of philips fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest,negative
it is a shame as the winner features a talented cast mr donofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range mr lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears mr madsen ms demornay and mr whaley have all done good work in the past,negative
none of the actors in the winner are in top form here and this film wont likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes,negative
director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss screenplay and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one,negative
while tedious the film is wellpaced and does not meander but it would be nearimpossible task for mr cox or for that matter virtually any other director that comes to mind to overcome the films widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization,negative
to his credit my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies,negative
i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened,negative
to be honest though i couldnt begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question,negative
the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing,negative
the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching,negative
susan grangers review of ghosts of mars sony pictures entertainment,negative
horror auteur john carpenter halloween vampires strikes out with this scifi ecofable thats so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got greenlit,negative
the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last years pitch black involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from bloodthirsty marauding aliens,negative
in the year 2176 there are 640 000 earthlings on mars living in a matriarchal society led by a commander played by pam grier,negative
grier pillpoppin natasha henstridge and some rookie mars police officers clea duvall jason statham travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch desolation williams thats ice cube to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder,negative
but when theyre besieged by demented zombielike bodysnatching miners they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection,negative
it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and soon after most of the miners went bonkers as longdormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies lopping off heads as vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet according to a scientist joanna cassidy,negative
carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the night of the living dead like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing,negative
but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed along with the order of their elimination,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 ghosts of mars thuds to a laborious bottomofthebarrel 1,negative
perhaps indeed there is a curse on mars films if you recall two other duds mission to mars and red planet,negative
adam sandler vehicles are never anything special but continue to make a load of money,negative
which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today,negative
while good comedies like rushmore to choose a recent example gets limited release and doesnt make a lot of money big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash,negative
its also nothing special and doesnt deserve the money its making,negative
but i digress,negative
sandler plays sonny koufax a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age,negative
his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him either wise up and get responsible or shes leaving him,negative
by a strange set of events koufax ends up with julian played by twins cole and dylan sprouse a five year old kid,negative
after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child koufax decides he wants to keep the child,negative
however social worker mr brooks mostel finds out that koufax isnt the real father and wants to take julian back,negative
koufax along with his new girlfriend layla lauren adams fight to keep the child,negative
big daddy really isnt that good,negative
many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny,negative
theres the occasional good one liner but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour,negative
the film after all these silly gags then suddenly turns sentimental and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous,negative
the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable and not helped by the soppy overacting,negative
its a poor attempt to win over the audience,negative
adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films except the wedding singer,negative
joey lauren adams is much much better and deserves a far better film than this trash,negative
steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo and his scenes are pretty funny,negative
rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man,negative
the two twins who play julian are o k they start out rather well but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn all american wholesome goodness at the end of the film where the tear juice is turned up high,negative
big daddy is really nothing special and is not even worth it for a few chuckles,negative
although it is actually well put together with nice direction good production design and even some montages this professionalism cant help the fact that the script and characters are trash,negative
big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler and thats about it,negative
tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy,negative
robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss,negative
he goes into depression and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ghetto side of every american city,negative
there lawernce attempts to steal his car but to no avail and is dragged along with robbins on a trip to arizona,negative
there they hold up a store are mistaken for two other robbers just like in my cousin vinny and are chased by the police and the other robbers,negative
of course theres gags along the way usually from lawernce,negative
although the film is midly funny and quite watchable theres something so horribly familiar about it all,negative
this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run theres lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and pratically the same idea as midnight run,negative
its full of all the road movie cliches and even has a comedy car chase which just seemed so eighties,negative
even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin or chevy chase eighties comedy,negative
there also isnt much chemistry between robbins and lawernce,negative
in planes trains and automobiles there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy,negative
in nothing to lose there is hardly chemistry at all,negative
towards the end the chemistry seems to work but for the bulk of the film there is hardly any,negative
the director directs the film in a workman like fashion but gets the jokes across,negative
and although there is no chemistry between the two leads they give good performances on their own,negative
lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance and robbins is alright aswell,negative
however robbins performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacobs ladder and the player,negative
in fact if you want to see robbins do comedy much better than in nothing to lose i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy where he is much funnier,negative
nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it however,negative
the humour isnt particulary sophisticated but if you enojyed dumb dumber you might enjoy this,negative
the characters in arizona are funny and theres also a good scene where robbins asks a shopkeeper which threatening approach was better lawerences which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeepers ass and swearing a lot or himselfs which was speaking in a deep scary voice but the gags are predictable the lack of chemistry infurating and the ending too farfetched and perfect,negative
nothing to lose then is robbins first bad movie and hopefully his last and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film,negative
he nearly ruined carreys career with ace ventura when nature calls lets hope he hasnt ruined robbins or even lawerences with nothing to lose,negative
battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close,negative
in fact ill be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years,negative
based on the novel by scientology guru l ron hubbard battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information,negative
its the year 3000 and an alien race called the psychlos which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers conquered our planet in nine minutes,negative
ok we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind,negative
when were we conquered,negative
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 000 years earlier and if that is the case then were going to get into a whole bunch of problems later trust me,negative
keep reading,negative
also why dont we get to see earth get conquered,negative
how the hell do you make a popcorn scifi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film,negative
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor and for the films first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver colorado,negative
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters,negative
so when the psychlos conquered earth were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills,negative
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered whenever that was,negative
this is definitely not the way to start an fi film,negative
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster and he begins to fight it,negative
the monster turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course,negative
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course with some shrubs growing over them,negative
so in 1 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time with only a few weeds growing over it,negative
anyway some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl john travolta a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit,negative
the cavemen led by barry pepper are forced to do their bidding or whatever but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet or something,negative
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 000 years earlier,negative
and were supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who cant even handle a few cavemen,negative
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos,negative
so jets left unattended for 1 000 years are still able to fly,negative
please if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood,negative
why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway,negative
shouldnt they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us,negative
the psychlos refer to humans as man animals but yet dogs are still dogs,negative
why arent they dog animals,negative
the psychlos are after mining earths precious resources but for 1 000 years are unaware of fort knox,negative
why do i even care at this point,negative
im a fan of travoltas and im glad to see hes back on the alist in hollywood despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon,negative
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie,negative
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here,negative
hes more than capable of making a menacing villain see broken arrow and but whenever his character came on screen i couldnt hold back my laughter,negative
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have travolta just looks like travolta,negative
all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face but travolta just has a goatee,negative
also travoltas acts with a sort of phony upperclass snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world,negative
ooooo scary villain,negative
as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better,negative
you can make a dumb but good scifi film i love independence day for example but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth,negative
i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening,negative
i cleaned my glasses walked around the theater made a grocery list chose my lottery numbers for the week replayed super bowl xxv in my head with commercials,negative
and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids,negative
by the time we actually reach the year 3000 people should still be avoiding this film,negative
folks save your cash,negative
dont go see it dont rent it and dont buy it,negative
youd be more entertained by taking the money youd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind watching it sail away hell send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal,negative
well entertain you plenty with that kind of money,negative
unless of course youre just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running which is just about all youll come away with from this movie,negative
that and a headache,negative
editors note for some reason though the day after my screening i converted to scientology,negative
im not sure why,negative
something just made me feel compelled make the choice,negative
movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good the bad and the despicable,negative
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in 95 but i wanted to rewrite it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics,negative
we need to be warned about some truly awful films too,negative
this picture was so bad it inspired the description for my 110 rating see ratings chart below,negative
the only thing saving it from a 010 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno,negative
so it does indeed have some plusses,negative
in fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff,negative
and her ability to whine and irritate us even while nude was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone,negative
this character is not smart not interesting and deliberately,negative
far too annoying far too often,negative
like in 1998s bulworth when the movie was over i didnt care one little iota about the main character,negative
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film though,negative
showgirls is too stupid to make a statement,negative
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary all about eve of all things,negative
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l mankiewicz was hed be well,negative
hed be a good screenwriter,negative
instead this project may have sunk his career,negative
he wrote the ha ha,negative
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed,negative
the same team who created a good sexfilm in 1992 basic instinct struck out here with their occasional violence gratuitous xrated sex scenes and numerous and quite unnecessary lesbian overtones,negative
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer,negative
after the supposed streetsmart young lady gets conned out of her suitcase by a slackjawed yokel in the opening sequence she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the stardust hotel,negative
nomi doesnt take advantage of this contact to break into the bigtime of dirty dancing right away,negative
first she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club,negative
she sells her hot little wares at the cheetah for a short time turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience,negative
hey i never said she wasnt a hot number,negative
maybe its that her body which gets her into the bigtime when the star of the stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops into the strip club it certainly isnt her brains or pleasant disposition,negative
crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend kyle maclachlan,negative
he also happens to be the pleasureseeking worm who runs the big show,negative
crystal gets nomi onto the stardust team and after an interminable amount of time nomi earns the role of crystals understudy,negative
the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal,negative
it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that shes not a whore,negative
thats a phrase we hear a few different times and its completely ludicrous,negative
of course she is,negative
she sells her soul to make it big but in the end were supposed to believe that shes a better person than that,negative
were supposed to root for her,negative
no way,negative
shes a tramp and a backstabber who deserved nothingleast of all vindication in the ahem climax,negative
she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is,negative
the subplot with a male dancer glenn plummer who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more,negative
it sure aint character development,negative
plummer also appeared in speed in 94 in a smaller yet better role,negative
this subplot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control,negative
kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big payday or his standards have dipped since appearing in blue velvet,negative
that picture was weird but some critics claim its one of the best movies of the 80s,negative
now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the 90s too,negative
his sleazy character is important to showgirls but we dont learn anything about him,negative
he uses people to get what he wants but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie,negative
is he a villain,negative
who cares,negative
ultimately this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit,negative
everyone must know by now about the softcore acts of copulation especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool,negative
what few reviewers take issue with is how meanspirited this movie is,negative
everyones either having sex exacting revenge or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge,negative
its just too hard to take especially for over two hours,negative
if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world why couldnt verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers grunts and other sounds during the dance numbers,negative
its hard to care about these people if we cant even appreciate what theyre capable of doing onstage,negative
berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body,negative
after all the world of porn is still an active dishonourable profession,negative
perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford,negative
oops theyre bad actors too,negative
well at least theyre not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone,negative
useless triviaironically elizabeth berkley played virtuous and holier than thou jessie on the teenybopper tv show saved by the bell before breaking onto the big screen,negative
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands,negative
thank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away,negative
your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon,negative
it isnt just the strobe light quality of your twentycutsperminute editing or the numbing overuse of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles,negative
welcome to the club scott kalvert,negative
your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and onedimensional serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole,negative
dicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based,negative
as the film opens jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw,negative
one night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin,negative
jims addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school,negative
along with mickey and pedro jim becomes a victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower,negative
the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner,negative
screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carrolls posse resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends,negative
as a film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale a 100 minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie,negative
jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie but i suppose that his pseudosensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out,negative
perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd,negative
without a character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strungout cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack,negative
director scott kalvert doesnt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slowmotion photography selfconsciously funky camera angles and choppy editing,negative
on only one occasion when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective,negative
mostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is,negative
they also dont allow leonardo dicaprios performance to be as strong as it could have been,negative
for every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics,negative
dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an exjunkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert wont let character interaction define this story,negative
he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting,negative
at isolate moments the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprios talents,negative
far more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like,negative
at the outset of swordfish john travoltas gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today,negative
basically he says it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers,negative
how ironic as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture,negative
swordfish is loud violent and amoral,negative
it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life,negative
and how does travoltas gabriel plan to do this,negative
by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to outterrorize terrorists,negative
swordfish is a very cynical movie,negative
it relies on an audiences perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as nonhuman faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration,negative
the movies plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down youd actually see how ridiculous it all is,negative
this is a liveaction road runner cartoon moving so quickly that its over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions,negative
the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson hugh jackman recruited by gabriel to crack the governments computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his antiterrorist campaign,negative
talk about whackedout patriotism,negative
my objections to swordfish are many,negative
the body count is high but that is expected in a movie of this sort,negative
its becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers police officers and government agents blown to bits,negative
another example is the family dynamics between stanley his 10yearold daughter and his exwife,negative
stanley though having served time in prison for hacking is shown as a loving and caring father forbidden by his ex to see his little girl,negative
audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husbands adult films,negative
thus when she is found murdered late in the movie neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve,negative
in fact subconsciously many in the audience are probably glad she was killed,negative
then there is the sequence involving one of gabriels henchman holding a gun to the head of stanleys daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel,negative
children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich in recent films,negative
there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them onscreen victims as well,negative
yea its only make believe but that doesnt mean you have to tolerate it,negative
travolta is cool deadly charming and flamboyant as the nearcrazy gabriel,negative
his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and,negative
jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings,negative
his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database,negative
his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate,negative
halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriels assistant while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel,negative
swordfish plays like a comic book with a largerthanlife character in gabriel,negative
viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain,negative
and maybe that is the movies underlying flaw there is no real hero to speak of only those doing their upmost to survive,negative
and that is not enough,negative
this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water,negative
the characters in jonathan lynns the whole nine yards yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies 1999s analyze this and mickey blue eyes 2000s gun shy are rarely ever written as real people but merely as onedimensional caricatures,negative
when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed it is not to service the character development or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations but to accommodate the convoluted plot,negative
in a lightweight comedy you might say it is not required to have perfectly realized figures just as long as they get the job done,negative
unfortunately for a comedy to work it has to at least succeed at being funny and if there was a laughometer available id guess that it briefly ascended around 2 5 of the time for me,negative
suffice to say the comedy in the whole nine yards works about as well as the brokendown lawnmower in my backyard and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes it is by sheer luck,negative
nicholas oz oseransky matthew perry is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec,negative
trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie rosanna arquette delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial frenchcanadian accent one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house nextdoor,negative
walking over to greet him he is horrified to discover it is jimmy the tulip tudeski bruce willis a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison,negative
once getting to know him and becoming his friend oz is more comfortable with his identity but for sophie it means a possible hitman to do away with oz,negative
in her scheme sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss kevin pollak about jimmys whereabouts but in the process he falls in love with jimmys wife cynthia natasha henstridge who is being held hostage,negative
upon return to quebec and with one contrivance after the next ozs dental assistant jill amanda peet is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside the tulip and forces him to set up a meeting since jills dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself,negative
have you got all that,negative
because there is more,negative
much much more,negative
and this is a movie that without credits is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour,negative
the whole nine yards is an ultimately unsatisfying and emptyheaded excursion into wellworn terrain already set by far superior pictures,negative
how the cast most of which are respectable actors got caught up in such a cliched deficient film remains a mystery unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynns 1985 comedy classic clue the movie,negative
going into the theater preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable but by the twentyminute mark when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time it was clear this production was in serious trouble,negative
since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot and the screenplay inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner collapses with every failing comedy bit the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and frequently entertainment value,negative
the whole nine yards is neither facetious nor aside from the subplot about jills shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman inventive and more often than not just lies there the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector but never igniting any sort of spark,negative
a few select actors do what they can with the material while others make no impact at all,negative
on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters matthew perry and bruce willis,negative
perry innocuously enjoyable on tvs friends plays the same exact sitcomstyle character in all of his movies from 1997s fools rush in to 1999s three to tango and it has become a crushing bore,negative
meanwhile willis makes next to no impression and because of the limited guise of his jimmy the tulip tudeski oftentimes disappears into the background,negative
their three female counterparts fare noticeably better,negative
best of all is natasha henstridge far more radiant than in the exploitative species movies who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia,negative
henstridge has the talent for sure to break out of these countless throwaway roles but first she must fire her agent,negative
amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who thus far has strived on a career based solely on comedy,negative
it is too bad then that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts,negative
finally rosanna arquette is awful as sophie but something tells me that was her purpose and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time,negative
also popping up is michael clarke duncan fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in the green mile as jimmys largely built friend and fellow killer frankie figs,negative
when the whole nine yards eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit,negative
a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films so what was the point,negative
without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments the whole nine yards rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast and half of the actors are not charming at all,negative
now what does that tell you,negative
as the twin surfer dudes stew and phil deedle lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother,negative
yanking out his iv he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brothers face,negative
this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disneys meet the deedles a movie more to be endured that watched,negative
i stopped looking at my wife during the screening since every time i did shed start sticking her finger in her throat,negative
and shes right it is that bad,negative
directed without any imagination by steve boyum whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction the film limps along at best,negative
boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts stunts and more stunts,negative
amazingly for someone with his background he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones and we have a car go off the road five different times maybe more,negative
but whos counting,negative
and then there is the script by james herzfeld whose only other film tapeheads from a decade ago was so awful that it is considered a cult classic,negative
meet the deedles however is painfully bad rather than laughably bad,negative
it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything,negative
herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes your geysers a geezer and id like to put a deedle in her haystack,negative
as the movie opens the twins who at one point describe themselves modestly as a walking kodak moment are celebrating their 18th birthday,negative
as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski,negative
as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laidback beach bums into men,negative
as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone theyve got their surfboards skateboards and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire,negative
their camp has gone out of business but they are mistaken for new park rangers,negative
the rest of the movie has them fighting the parks overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged exranger played by dennis hopper who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration scheduled for later in the week,negative
hopper who has made some wonderful movies carried away being a recent favorite does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material,negative
this isnt his worst acting but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie hes ever been in,negative
steve van wormer and paul walker as stew and phil give lifeless performances,negative
the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey,negative
even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull,negative
to add insult to injury hennings is fond of inappropriate closeups which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog,negative
put a tenfoot pair of lips on the screen and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said,negative
although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movies stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road,negative
they make it look like so much fun that im sure many will try some variation of the stunt,negative
how could this possibly be worst asks phil,negative
just when you suspect it cant the movie takes a turn further downhill,negative
its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag,negative
after phils girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil they suck in a long worm,negative
like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp their lips finally meet in a kiss,negative
as they pull back their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested,negative
meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half,negative
it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up,negative
my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas both almost 9 gave the show,negative
they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites,negative
nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo,negative
brian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed to kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise with him,negative
sadly he forget to bring a good story and believable characters,negative
nic cage plays rick santaro a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne sinise,negative
an assassination takes place and santaro tries to peace together how it took place trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy,negative
the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together,negative
however the film doesnt keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the film is at a dead end,negative
although there are some fantastic shots by de palma including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film halfway through the film drops dead,negative
the problem is that de palma doesnt have a strong story or characters to work with,negative
he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and i quickly got bored,negative
nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters but its no use,negative
they are boring faceless and completely unlikeable,negative
yes another problem with the film is that theres noone to root for,negative
were supposed to be on cages side because his character becomes nicer throughout the film,negative
however his change is sadly unbelievable,negative
poor gary sinises character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way,negative
the films use of flashback quickly gets boring,negative
while clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go,negative
they certainly dont increase the tension or suspense of the movie,negative
there is small thread of suspense running through the film but it certainly doesnt make this film a powerhouse thriller rather just a slightly below average one,negative
the script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional,negative
certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller,negative
the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential,negative
theres a good story buried in snake eyes its just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks,negative
it also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end,negative
while the performances are intriguing especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case theres no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance and unless youre a big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided,negative
a david wilcock review 1998,negative
you know for kids norville barnes,negative
i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3,negative
the best way i can put it is that its funky,negative
i know this is an odd question but remember the opening music of police academy 4 citizens on patrol when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song citizens on patrol during the opening credits,negative
its just like that,negative
anyway part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 so technically still 1985,negative
this time a group of horny teens who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed,negative
it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life which must have been between parts 1 and 2 so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me,negative
shes the lone survivor this time,negative
part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3d and from what i can tell from the video it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects,negative
jason had long wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 now one day later hes completely bald,negative
also it being one day later it cant be friday the 13th now can it,negative
oh well,negative
steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series,negative
r,negative
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the winkandaconcussivenudge bombastorama con air,negative
the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an illfated barroom brawl,negative
the prison scenes are accompanied by voiceovers in which poe in a languid southern drawl describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met,negative
if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity it probably should,negative
cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dimwitted and ridiculous and that hes going to have to do something to keep himself entertained,negative
and thus he slips into a familiar surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings cage plays cameron poe as a buffedup version of raising arizonas h i mcdonnough,negative
cage should have known what he was getting himself into,negative
he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock and if theres one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production even without his late partner don simpson its that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the last bruckheimer production,negative
the critical difference between the rock and con air is cages performance,negative
in the rock cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time,negative
that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry selfawareness,negative
while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home cages goal is different but just as simple to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact,negative
audiences too should know what theyre getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production,negative
in fact the marketing people are counting on it,negative
no one who loathed the rock for its sweargruntblast repetitiveness will be converted by con air no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded,negative
director simon west yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwabs soda fountain delivers exactly the kind of cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture its perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma like insulin con air does the work of a gland,negative
what he doesnt deliver is a moment of suspense,negative
a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcocks notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk a really really big desk and a really really big bomb will serve the purpose nicely,negative
if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension they might have done something with con airs creepiest setup,negative
at a desert stop for the planeload of convicts serial killer garland greene steve buscemi wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool,negative
their teteatete is eerie and menacing providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains danny trejo ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them,negative
in fact con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement too many characters too much editing too many dopey punch lines too much of the cheap ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts,negative
it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance,negative
while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack as a u s marshal goes for earnest cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep,negative
his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies,negative
it doesnt bode well for cages appearance in later this month perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over,negative
theres a word for people like you nicolas,negative
that word is called recidivist repeat,negative
offender,negative
romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant,negative
with director peter medak whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays and topnotch character actors gary oldman and lena olin they seemed likely to be a successful combination,negative
those mentioned films however brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not a solid wellwritten screenplay,negative
call me cynical but the jobs of writer and producer dont seem to mix well,negative
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi a good cop turned bad selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife,negative
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname although the name doesnt provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character,negative
jack has become addicted to feeding the hole a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money,negative
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot he feebly attempts to get out,negative
gary oldmans performance is disappointingly weak he seems nearly bored,negative
in the process he also gets tangledup with mona demarkov a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone played adequately by roy scheider,negative
demarkov played by lena olin is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world,negative
this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 i cant remember seeing a character quite like her,negative
after being shot handcuffed and thrown in the back seat of a car she still manages to cause an accident kick out the windshield with her legs grab a suitcase full of money plus some important documentation climb through the rubble land on her shot leg and still succeed at running for safety,negative
what a woman,negative
lena olins performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film,negative
anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeos wife,negative
there is little insight into her character,negative
shes depressed she makes obvious references she mopes around the house,negative
juliette lewis as romeos girlfriend is treated with the same cliche attitudes although ms lewis portrayal certainly didnt improve it,negative
both women were anything but sexy or attractive,negative
poorly developed characters aside the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems,negative
it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character not to do something,negative
for example jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scopeout the mob scene,negative
fine,negative
jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite,negative
fine,negative
what does jack proceed to do,negative
he brushes his friends off by telling them he isnt feeling well then strolls over to the boss,negative
why,negative
the boss had all ready threatened him falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jacks toes by the gravesite,negative
i guess they werent worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral,negative
or heres another demarkov setup her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw,negative
she proceeded to set the place on fire,negative
wouldnt the flames burn off the fingerprints,negative
arent dental records more important,negative
as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be couldnt she come up with a better plot,negative
and it took her no time at all to get a goodfitting functional prosthesis,negative
lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film,negative
this film doesnt even add up the large details,negative
there is little or no consistency in the storyline,negative
not much makes sense,negative
the direction lacks cohesion surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable,negative
the moods shift the styles shift and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one,negative
so while it certainly isnt reservoir dogs it certainly isnt diva,negative
theres plenty more to tear apart in this film,negative
my advice to someone who hasnt seen it to to wait until it comes on video,negative
there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously,negative
its not a boring film just not a good one,negative
or an intelligent one,negative
if you havent plunked down your hardearned money yet for wild wild west the latest summer holiday offering from will smith let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbucks frappacino or on a ben jerrys sundae,negative
these treats are great relief from the summer heat,negative
in contrast this film made me simmer in disappointment,negative
i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat,negative
this was true of star wars episode i but at least in that film the story and the characters were still in the back seat,negative
in this film they are no where to be found,negative
what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats lots of female extras who look like cancan dancers and a clunky 80foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula,negative
two men are asked to stop this threat,negative
one is artemus gordon kevin kline an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents,negative
among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest,negative
the other man is jim west will smith who prefers the shootfirstthenshootsomemore method of investigating,negative
although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate twoman vaudevillian act,negative
for example there is a scene where west being more debonair than the reserved gordon notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat which is what it is currently filled with,negative
now touch my breast west says,negative
gordon does so and then softly coos his approval,negative
i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness,negative
the script fails to generate any sense of drama humor or fun for that matter,negative
i did enjoy klines reserved performance but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith,negative
could it be that will smith is just so bankable that hes not even required to act,negative
it was as if the director was yelling will smith do your own thing and,negative
action,negative
heres an example,negative
in this scene will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people,negative
he must endear himself to the crowd to escape,negative
the director yells will smith do your own thing and,negative
action,negative
in another scene he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades,negative
will smith do your own thing and,negative
action,negative
worse still the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess,negative
there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look,negative
theres actually a lot of imagination at work in this film,negative
there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat,negative
and thats too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his thing this film might have been palatable,negative
as it turns out wild wild west is the wild wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year,negative
billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy,negative
he tries to infuse some life into it but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication,negative
sammy billy crystal is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes,negative
hes separated from his wife serena kathleen quinlan and down to his last serious client in a lowbudget film shooting in romania,negative
but in a turn of bad luck sammy wrecks his car only,negative
to be mysteriously saved by a giant gheorghe muresan,negative
but this giant has a heart of gold,negative
he leads a solitary life helping out the monks at a local monastery,negative
his only longing is for his long lost love lilianna joanna pacula who has since moved to america,negative
sammy seeing a golden ticket convinces max to become an actor represented by sammy of course and come back to america,negative
and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before maxs nose,negative
but slowly sammys deceptions begin to haunt him,negative
but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned,negative
the humor in my giant isnt the worlds greatest,negative
mostly it falls under the category of boy hes,negative
so big,negative
and that can only go so far no matter how hard the talent tries,negative
still its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments,negative
the films best moment and thats not saying much is a bit part by steven seagal playing himself,negative
between executive decision and this all of seagals best roles have been cameos,negative
maybe he should consider a change of work steven seagal the character actor,negative
gheorghe muresan isnt a natural actor at all and his thick cottonmouthed accent certainly doesnt help,negative
in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature,negative
originally the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant,negative
andre also had a hefty accent but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride something,negative
muresan should have studied for some pointers,negative
why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies,negative
hes proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be and yet like a glutton for punishment he keeps coming back,negative
that doesnt mean we have to,negative
everybody in this films thinking of alicia,negative
no this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the cryin video,negative
this is one of those erotic thrillers but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed,negative
first off theres zero sex almost no nudity and its not as wellplotted as one of those tweed flicks,negative
well anyway,negative
the plot,negative
alicia plays well the babysitter who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents j t,negative
walsh and lee garlington go out to a party,negative
the film trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers shows every characters thoughts except alicias,negative
the thing is alicias in most of them in most cases and the thoughts arent too kosher,negative
first off theres her boyfriend jeremy london who gave one of the alltime lousy performances in mallrats and is only a notch better here whos a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully played by nicky katt from suburbia who shows hes got that quiet creepiness down pat once again,negative
they decide they want to crash her babysitting job looking for the typical babysitting hankypanky,negative
somethine like that,negative
the film intercuts between the subplots alicia babysitting nicky and jeremy the party and each characters thoughts,negative
we get to see jeremy and nickys dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia j t,negative
thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub she has it all covered up the little tease and worst of all lee garlington dreaming of that hunk george segal,negative
it even shows them in bed together,negative
yea,negative
i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed though i guess im used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in flirting with disaster,negative
the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing but come on,negative
like we care about any of the characters,negative
the only interesting one is alicia mainly because shes alicia and we mostly see her in the fantasies,negative
so i guess shes some kind of mystery or something,negative
but she is never explored further,negative
so basically this film is just a series of mastabatory images sometimes featuring a nonnude alicia once again sadly sometimes featuring a scantilyclad george segal once again sadly,negative
i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night and let me tell you it is the only way to watch this film,negative
i mean theres a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night theyre just as good as sleeping pills,negative
and this one is one big fat waste of time even for an alicia film,negative
the crown jewel of 1970s irwin allen disaster movies the poseidon adventure features an allstar cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship,negative
the story begins on the u s s,negative
poseidons big new years cruise where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive,negative
lets see theres the new age preacher hackman who advises people to pray to that part of god within yourself,negative
theres the excop borgnine who busted a hooker stella stevens six times then married her,negative
theres the hippie singer theres got to be a morning after who turns to the company of a lonely man red buttons once her brother is killed,negative
and to round out the group the elderly couple jack albertson and shelley winters who live aboard the ship the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall,negative
we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship,negative
everyones in the giant ballroom at the time shortly past midnight of the new year when the ship turns first on its side then completely upside down,negative
the second incommand wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship,negative
in this case because the ship is overturned the top is the bottom,negative
or is the bottom the top,negative
either way we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and in the ballroom scene christmas trees,negative
thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors through burning rooms etc while the ship slowly fills with water behind them,negative
its a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting,negative
the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at with all the melodrama that comes inbetween the nonthrilling action scenes,negative
the one note in borgnines onenote performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love although since there isnt a sex scene we never find out if his buttons really are red and albertson and winters wonder if theyll live to see their grandsons birth,negative
shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along,negative
winters who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie stevens even notso affectionately calls her fatass in one scene finally finds her purpose,negative
i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen she brags and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years shes swimming through the water her skirt billowing up around her hips showing off her cellulite or do you call it shellulite,negative
ridden thighs,negative
its not so much funny as innately disgusting which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole,negative
in french the phrase film noir literally means black film,negative
webster defines it as a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music,negative
classic film noir including such memorable fare as the big sleep the original cape fear and orson welles striking a touch of evil employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre,negative
color came into play with neonoir films like chinatown and blade runner,negative
l a confidential easily the best film of 1997 is a wonderful piece of contemporary neonoir filmmaking,negative
for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neonoir and create an absolute mess theres palmetto,negative
based on just another sucker a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase palmetto shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance,negative
director volker schlondorff tin drum the handmaids tale stated we werent even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy,negative
it shows,negative
palmetto is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy,negative
the story begins when journalist harry barber woody harrelson is released from prison,negative
someone turned states witness and revealed that harry was framed a reward for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto,negative
bitter and broke harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over but exgirlfriend nina gina gershon appears to return him to palmetto,negative
while hanging out at a bar he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth,negative
harry pockets her cash only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket,negative
no problem though,negative
the radiant blonde is rhea malroux elisabeth shue the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems and she has a proposition for harry,negative
rhea needs a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny,negative
the girls want to bilk a halfmillion dollar ransom from the old man and will happily give harry 50 000 for helping with the scam,negative
things go wrong of course,negative
odette is found dead leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks,negative
in an ironic twist harry is asked to work for the local d a s,negative
office,negative
they need a press liaison to field questions about odettes kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job,negative
not a bad setup for a noir film if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material but he never settles on a consistent tone,negative
the actors dont know what to do with their characters either muddling the proceedings even further,negative
as if that wasnt enough the story suffers from major problems in logic,negative
woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts but hes lost here,negative
presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme,negative
harrelson clearly doesnt know what to do with harrys character so he spends most of the film glowering sweating and generally acting miserable,negative
meanwhile elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide,negative
as the stepdaughter chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr despite a number of steamy scenes theres no chemistry between harrelson and the women,negative
to make matters worse schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the characters lips are running over each others bodies,negative
two particularly bad scenes highlight the films problems,negative
while driving with a body in his trunk harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up,negative
the officer wants to help change harrys flat tire and asks him to open the trunk,negative
harrys pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy but under schlondorffs grim direction the scene is just embarrassing,negative
the films nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina,negative
were supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip,negative
had palmetto been played with tongue firmly in cheek it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story,negative
but under the harsh direction of schlondorff the film is just a sluggish paintbynumbers exercise in neo noir cluelessness,negative
avoid this nonsense and go see l a confidential instead,negative
what is this a homicide or a bad bmovie,negative
that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie,negative
let me clear things up for you cupcake this isnt a bad bmovie its a really bad bmovie,negative
so bad its almost good,negative
almost but not quite,negative
the movie starts off in the 1950s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth,negative
it is a bunch of sluglike creatures that kill people and take over their bodies,negative
the slugs first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody,negative
that is until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986,negative
he and the slugs inside him promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more coeds into slug zombies,negative
a slightly crazed cop tom atkins and the requisite girl with the face of an angel jill whitlow join these two geeky university students jason lively and steve marshall to do battle with the slugs,negative
it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs,negative
the acting is bad with a capital b the story is worse,negative
and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie,negative
the only saving grace was the requisite titshot courtesy of jill whitlow,negative
it had absolutely nothing to do with the story but i liked it,negative
actually it was the high point of the movie for me,negative
of course that isnt really saying much,negative
the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion,negative
which gives it a leg up on some other horror films,negative
unlike most movies of this genre there actually is a story,negative
not a great one but it is there,negative
this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th halloween and nightmare on elm street movies,negative
you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better,negative
but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a bmovie horror marathon,negative
just dont be too upset if you cant find it,negative
you really wont be missing that much,negative
it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller,negative
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others myself included would pick seven days in may,negative
both those films were tense exercises in chills,negative
the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man john frankenheimer,negative
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively,negative
for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed,negative
each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot,negative
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay,negative
the thrills all came from the plot,negative
ronin is like a film made by another man,negative
somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot but we see only tiny pieces of it,negative
we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j d zeiks screenplay is a bit obscure,negative
the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai,negative
when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death he becomes a ronin much like a gunfighter in the american west,negative
if you miss the opening do not worry,negative
this film will explain again what a ronin is,negative
sam played by robert de niro is the modern equivalent of a ronin,negative
he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer,negative
he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france,negative
sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre natascha mcelhone of the truman show an irish woman to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case,negative
dierdre is very tightlipped about what is in the case,negative
sam joins a team of four others vincent jean reno of the and mission impossible spence sean bean tvs richard sharpe and also patriot games and goldeneye and gregor stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting,negative
also along is larry skipp suddeth,negative
the group seems to know their business particularly sam but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise,negative
their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team,negative
the story is not very easy to follow,negative
it is never clear who is doublecrossing whom and who is working for whom,negative
somehow russians who may or may not be the russian mafia and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case,negative
some very good actors are involved in this film,negative
one wonders what they saw in the script,negative
the characters are mostly onedimensional professional killers,negative
they know their work and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed,negative
by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody,negative
maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts since these are not very demanding characters to create,negative
in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal,negative
as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy,negative
unfortunately there are no deep characters and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it,negative
i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
nonspoiler incidentally the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin,negative
also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet,negative
this is the first blow of the 47 ronin,negative
its always a bad sign when the core audience of a film children are either walking out early or are halfasleep when the credits roll at the end of a film,negative
that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians a cold pea soup of cute animals stupid home alone antics a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression,negative
indeed walt disney is rolling over in his grave again cursing john hughes name for making the original liveaction 101 dalmatians one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time and now its sequel,negative
the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor 101 dalmatians,negative
the original made more than 100 million dollars at the box office spawned a torrid collection of collectible items that ended up months later in the discount bins of walmarts across the country and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas,negative
well its been about four years since then and dalmatian fever is coming back and this time its digitally enhanced,negative
heres the story,negative
cruella de vil glenn close is released from prison due to the cure of her puppy homicide urges by one dr pavlov,negative
oh how witty,negative
she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film,negative
cruella then becomes ella dog lover until the plot twists like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck and she becomes the evil vixen again,negative
a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula,negative
at this point i was envying those kids filing out of the theater,negative
how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu as the films villain sunk in the film business,negative
its almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon,negative
and depardieu,negative
how can a french guy have a bad french accent,negative
and never mind the toilet brush haircut,negative
the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent courtesy of eric idle that thinks hes a rottweiler,negative
now thats funny,negative
deep rising gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squidlike menace but the unfolding story is artificial silly and almost completely derivative of countless other and for the most part better films,negative
while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures take for example the schlocky mountain highs of last springs anaconda deep rising has no tongue to put in its cheek,negative
folks were only a month into the new year and already heres a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases,negative
most of the action takes place on the argonautica a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage uhoh if these people had seen titanic then maybe theyd have known to stay home when its attacked by a giant tentacled sea creature,negative
the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian famke janssen argonautica owner canton anthony heald and a few other crew members,negative
a mercenary team lead by resourceful captain john finnegan treat williams board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby,negative
but what their search of the ship uncovers is something bloodsoaked hungry and not very helpful,negative
the main problem with deep rising is its overt familiarity the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci films in recent memory,negative
the concept is leviathan meets titanic with a dash of speed 2 thrown in for good or is that bad,negative
measure,negative
this monster is equal parts 20 000 leagues under the sea and the relic knows how to open doors like the raptors from jurassic park and even gets to expel a halfdigested victim a neat effect admittedly a la the giant snake in anaconda,negative
some of the attack sequences are straight out of jaws and alien,negative
a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of alien resurrection,negative
theres even a jet ski chase like hard rain,negative
and the list goes on,negative
watching deep rising s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself because none of them have welldeveloped characters nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy,negative
williams is affable enough but his finnegan just isnt believable,negative
an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted pretty famke janssen best known as goldeneye s killer thighs is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams while kevin j oconnor as finnegans mechanic provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast,negative
djimon honsou who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in decembers amistad pops up in a brief part,negative
he needs to stay away from the water,negative
the movies final shot is a groaner as is the 11thhour regurgitation of a subplot involving an onship saboteur,negative
as if a cast deserving of their snack foodfate isnt bad enough when you taunt the monster youre really asking for it deep rising is a slow stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot,negative
and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is the closer we are to the end of the movie rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isnt out of the question,negative
the beach is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder,negative
every forty minutes of this twohour film begins with a new theme virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act,negative
it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment,negative
but then in the second act the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of blue lagoon,negative
forty minutes later the mood changes once more and it becomes a dumbed down version of lord of the flies where an isolated community is discovered where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs,negative
by the time its over you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about,negative
the main character of the beach is angstridden richard leonardo dicaprio,negative
he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if youre looking for a good time,negative
richards voiceover tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown,negative
this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for,negative
he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy robert carlisle,negative
he seems like a raving lunatic obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis,negative
though his jagged behavior would distress most of us richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen,negative
moreover the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life,negative
captivated by the idea he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey,negative
they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richards,negative
once they finally arrive at this paradise however the mood of the story shifts to richards growing desire for francoise,negative
this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard,negative
etienne is about as exciting as fluffy white sand,negative
its odd that etienne never sees this coming but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view,negative
and once the three stumble across the hidden community mood shift imminent more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers,negative
for example there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards,negative
and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark,negative
there are several ideas that are introduced in the beach and each one could merit its own featurelength film,negative
theres the man vs nature angle the love triangle angle and the utopiagoneawry angle,negative
but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred,negative
dicaprio as a result has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through,negative
consequently the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up,negative
last summer a featurelength version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning,negative
based on the famous 60s television show the film was an enormous boxoffice flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros a year later the studio is up to their old tricks again with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild wild west,negative
but it sounded promising the same tagteam of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success is at the reins again,negative
and costar kevin kline is attached to the project as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects,negative
i mean what could possibly go wrong,negative
the answer is just about everything,negative
wild wild west is a cinematic abomination a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate,negative
there are a lot of fancy special effects and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression,negative
but the script is so deliriously uneven the entire movie so off course that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it,negative
at square one we have a bizarre case of casting,negative
will smith plays james west a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series,negative
my guess regarding the casting of africanamerican smith is a simple one the actor a cozy summertime release big bucks for all those involved,negative
smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material but this is not an ideal role for him,negative
hes too much of a joker,negative
i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role and frankly that sounds a lot more plausible,negative
what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such selfassurance in his eyes you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office,negative
the plot involves west and crossdressing government agent artemus gordon kevin kline who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists,negative
the trail leads to the diabolical dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry witty southern accent,negative
loveless has taken the countrys top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns,negative
one such weapon is an 80foot mechanical tarantula bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right,negative
the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular seamlessly blending computergenerated imagery with the western surroundings,negative
unfortunately all of these effects seem so detached from the story and can do little to support the films plot deficiencies which are undoubtedly the main problem,negative
wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works,negative
most of the jokes usually care of smith die on arrival,negative
if its one thing that could possibly be the saving grace its the performances and even they are mostly offkilter and poorly delivered,negative
kline is admirable but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot,negative
salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest because she is viewed as little more than that window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon,negative
branagh an esteemed shakespearean actor and director adds marginal enjoyment to the film,negative
but even he is so utterly weird and overthetop,negative
rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is,negative
i suppose theres always one turkey of the summer season a highly anticipated bigbudget release that manages to completely disappoint,negative
wild wild west is such a movie and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999,negative
but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office,negative
perhaps after this audiences will be less assured when they see will smiths name stamped on a summer movie,negative
after such hits as independence day and mib wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume,negative
capsule gal is a 50sish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain,negative
his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he cant refuse,negative
a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns,negative
0 4 to 4,negative
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast who would have guessed that the most savage maddog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by,negative
ben kingsley,negative
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark henry fonda in once upon a time in the west or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it,negative
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild sympathetic or even ineffectual character roles,negative
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious,negative
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast,negative
gary gal dove played by ray winstone has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain,negative
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing,negative
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a onetwopunch,negative
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa,negative
the second punch comes from gals past,negative
back in london gang boss teddy bass ian mcshane tvs lovejoy is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal,negative
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ben kingsley to fetch gal,negative
don will accept any decision gal makes from yes to certainly,negative
however if gal says no don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guys exporn star wife deedee amanda redman,negative
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybodys skin,negative
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness,negative
there are some serious problems in louis melliss and david scintos script that should have been caught before filming,negative
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success,negative
beyond an ability to use skindiving gear no special talents are required of him,negative
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for,negative
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault flooding the vault,negative
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool,negative
in spite of the provocative title the story is cliched and overly familiar,negative
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade,negative
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw a robert taylor type who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability,negative
the old gang however wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git im,negative
it is not a great plot,negative
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards,negative
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film,negative
it is an old plot dressed up to look new,negative
if the plot is old at least the style is creative,negative
this is director jonathan glazers first film but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout,negative
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences,negative
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes,negative
we see one side of a persons faces,negative
but the other side fades into the darkness a sort of metaphor for the halfworld these characters inhabit,negative
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden,negative
we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog,negative
at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking the heavy accents and the cockney language,negative
sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre the london crime film,negative
the plot may be new to british crime films but it would be overly familiar as a western,negative
further respectability comes from ben kingsleys highpowered performance,negative
i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film i have a problem even regarding it as a film,negative
its more of a show a big commercial for ted turners world championship wrestling wcw,negative
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page goldberg and sting,negative
the story is very minimal and basic,negative
there are these two guys gordy david arquette and sean scott caan,negative
they are two twentysomething wrestling fans from wyoming,negative
when they go to a live event for the big match up there favorite wrestler jimmy king oliver platt is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus joe pantoliano,negative
gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans,negative
on the way they meet some people have some fun and clean up some portopotties,negative
sounds great huh well its not,negative
the movie makes many attempts at humor only a few of them work,negative
the jokes that make you laugh however do not outnumber the films many duds,negative
there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa,negative
the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back,negative
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquettes tag team partner is macho man randy savage,negative
they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor,negative
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan,negative
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl the cheerleaders of the wcw,negative
she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowans breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face,negative
now what didnt work in this movie,negative
that would be the rest of it,negative
the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets,negative
the two lead characters work for a portopotty cleaning company and when they crash the truck the excrements spill all over the road,negative
its not funny its pathetic and brainless,negative
the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way,negative
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie,negative
the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle like that would happen to any fan especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set,negative
also i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily they just walked right in,negative
i like wrestling,negative
i watch it at home and laugh,negative
its continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldnt watch it,negative
this movie wasnt even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv,negative
the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew,negative
the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently,negative
the movie was too dimwitted to be funny,negative
it is possibly the most useless and underdeveloped film ever,negative
a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film detroit rock city,negative
that movie was interesting well done and continuously funny unlike this film,negative
the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh,negative
now that the scream trilogy is over arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1800callatt ads,negative
at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox,negative
hes in the funny parts of the film but there arent enough to make him look good,negative
the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rocks bawitdaba and cowboy,negative
martin landau has a great cameo as a classic hardnosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne,negative
script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin,negative
a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it,negative
at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real,negative
the wrestlers form alliances go to peoples houses and beat them up,negative
its utterly ridiculous,negative
the whole film was a wasteful dumfounding experience,negative
the movie was made to pay homage to the fans telling them things that made wrestling not the wrestlers,negative
the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a pottyhumor movie,negative
the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic twohour commercial to watch it,negative
if youre going to watch wrestling watch wwf its actually entertaining,negative
the wrestling is betters theyre funnier more diverse and have better entrance themes,negative
oh and the girls are hotter,negative
is this what movies have become 2 hourlong commercials that you have to pay to see,negative
dont waste your money,negative
capsule this superlight situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems,negative
the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television,negative
the characters are paperthin and the interesting ideas purely nonexistent,negative
this is a decrementlifeby90minutes card,negative
0 4 to 4,negative
jalla jalla,negative
is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen,negative
it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love,negative
the film is set in sweden where roro and mans fares fares and torkel petersson are custodians at a public park roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely mans is a swede from a much more liberal background,negative
they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park cleaning up after dogs,negative
roro and mans each have girlfriends but each has a problem,negative
roro nicknamed jalla is having family problems,negative
it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman yasmin laleh pourkarim but he is already in love with lisa tuva novotny,negative
yasmin likes roro but does not want to get married either,negative
mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence,negative
the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other,negative
mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers,negative
the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them,negative
roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other but then plan to break up before the wedding,negative
not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected,negative
the plot turns in several places are contrived,negative
one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen,negative
lebaneseborn josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer,negative
when things start to get slow he just adds throws in another story,negative
for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film,negative
characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function,negative
we do see some of roros family life and his concerns,negative
that may be because roros background is a lot like that of the director,negative
while the story was entertaining i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film,negative
it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life,negative
one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this,negative
i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
this is the worst movie ive seen since the so bad i walked out on it jingle all the way,negative
it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap,negative
it is crap through and through,negative
nothing works in this film as to be expected from joel schumacher who has made only one watchable film in his entire career that being cousins,negative
heres a man who admits hes a medicore director a rather charmingly selfeffacing statement,negative
but truth be told he is much worse than mediocre,negative
not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again,negative
there is no plot anywhere and the dialogue is unrelentingly shallow preposterous and boring,negative
they set up mr freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest oneliners,negative
it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death,negative
but thats par for course nothing in this film makes any sense including half of arnold schwarzeneggers lines,negative
as mr freeze arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once,negative
this is the same problem he had in jingle all the way and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass,negative
personally i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesnt retake scenes to make him understandable,negative
compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in batman robin,negative
apparently james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold,negative
uma thurman is not as bad but nothing resembling good either,negative
her poison ivy vamps around terribly chewing up scenery left and right,negative
and her pamela isley scenes are marred by subsnl standard acting as if shes reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment,negative
given the script its a wonder it didnt happen more frequently,negative
there is no redeeming feature in this film not george clooney as batman chris odonnell as robin nor alicia silverstone as batgirl,negative
michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance,negative
in fact there was something unsettling about his appearance which seems to have been accomplished without any makeup tricks looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man,negative
unfortunately every scene about alfreds sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance they just go through the motions losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart,negative
the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle you know theres a bunch of people but instead of a melee schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist,negative
theres never a moment of awe wonder or mayhem,negative
the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects which are impressive and probably expensive,negative
even then the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable,negative
the hockey team from hell,negative
not even the tv series got that stupid at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that batman robin showcases,negative
frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do,negative
blink and youll miss elle macpherson as julie madison vivica fox as a why is she even in the film vamp in freezes lair with all of two lines and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had,negative
and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs fries she isnt even filmed well enough to look good trust me shes quite attractive outside of this dreck,negative
and as if the film werent bad enough to limp along with bad direction bad dialogue bad performances and bad fight scenes there are inconsistencies and illogic galore,negative
i know its nitpicky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs why the characters arms arent ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a onearmed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet while holding on to another person no less or where the moisture comes from when freezes weapon creates tons if ice,negative
thats all traditional comic book stuff,negative
but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of bystanders,negative
why is there a big switch clearly marked heat in mr freezes lair,negative
why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr freeze hand to hand,negative
why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her,negative
why do batman robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency,negative
and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones why dont they wear masks to filter it out,negative
i could go on and on,negative
batman robin is a braindead pointless garish loud film that should still reign as the worst film of the year by the time 1998 rolls along,negative
note to warner bros if youre going to make another batman film please replace schumacher with nearly anyone,negative
because it could actually get worse than this,negative
what schumacher does not understand is that comic book doesnt automatically equal unbearable idiocy,negative
the true equation seems to be schumacher batman unbearable idiocy,negative
virus is a monster movie without a monster,negative
any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise,negative
sadly virus does not deliver on any level,negative
the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something we never find out what to a big boat with lots of satellites on it,negative
sudddenly a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat,negative
cut to seven days later we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures,negative
see they spend all their time sailing around looking for deadinthewater ships to rescue and then collect the reward money,negative
at least i think thats what they do,negative
along with many other things in the film their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isnt really explained,negative
so they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it and decide to haul it back to russian waters,negative
the only problem is the crew starts disappearing onebyone and turning into borg,negative
yes borg,negative
complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye,negative
apparently this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical,negative
so it creates makeshift machines and uses humans for spare parts,negative
blah blah blah,negative
i could go on forever describing the ludicrous socalled plot but i wont,negative
suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man,negative
everything else in this movie has been taken from other better movies,negative
for example many of the machines resemble those found in the littleseen japanese movie tetsuothe iron man,negative
and the plot is right out of aliens,negative
the funny thing is i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie,negative
i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies like last years underappreciated deep rising,negative
but virus as i mentioned earlier doesnt even have a monster,negative
it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption,negative
virus is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it,negative
besides the lame monster its chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into,negative
for example there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to negotiate with the alien,negative
now i dont know about you but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it,negative
that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life,negative
finally virus isnt scary,negative
the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary,negative
as it is its about as frightening as a box of cookies,negative
skip virus,negative
if its a cool monster movie you want rent the far superior and the granddaddy of this genre aliens,negative
i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuousenoughonthesurface romantic comedy,negative
its not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless,negative
i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999,negative
in a word its the same thing thats wrong with so many movies circa 1999 writing,negative
more to the point its the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when youre telling a story about a relationship,negative
the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where were expected to get dewyeyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because theyre attractive and pleasant,negative
in this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon chris odonnell a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage,negative
its a scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years,negative
convinced despite his reservations that its time to sh t or get off the pot jimmy proposes to anne very badly,negative
anne refuses which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves a very specific video will,negative
jimmy stands to inhereit 100 million if he is married by 6 05 p m on his 30th birthday stays married for 10 years and produces a child,negative
there are only a couple of minor problems 1 jimmys 30th birthday is the next day 2 anne is nowhere to be found meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many exgirlfriends,negative
its a wacky brewsters millionsesque premise acknowledged as such in one of the films better more selfaware lines of dialogue the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters,negative
at least that would be the case if jimmy werent already a worldclass altruist,negative
screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy doesnt get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs,negative
from the outset jimmys motivation isnt cash its the livelihoods of his devoted employees,negative
its almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelors plot development,negative
by any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless,negative
and thats the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness,negative
theres never any tension between the two starcrossed lovers because theres no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake,negative
the blandly nice odonnell couldnt pull off a randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers dont even let him zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged,negative
and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation,negative
the parade of sitcom set pieces had better be damned funny since theyre all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion,negative
ill admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinovs rantings about procreation and a restaurant fulltobursting with men popping questions and champagne corks,negative
far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church,negative
youre never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor but thats not the real problem,negative
nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warmnfuzzy conclusion its leading up to,negative
the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warmnfuzzy theres no spark no energy no humanity,negative
its an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions,negative
weve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment dont even have a pulse,negative
the bachelor is love among the mannequins,negative
whether you like the beatles or not nobody wants to see the bee gees take on some of the fab fours best known songs,negative
well maybe thats not true,negative
maybe youre curious the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose,negative
you just have to know how bad bad can be,negative
if thats the case rejoice because it was twenty years ago today or so that sgt,negative
peppers lonely hearts club band was released unleashed to the world and thanks to our modern technological advances you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs,negative
derived from the lyrics of various beatles songs sgt,negative
peppers tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song and album of the same name released in 1967,negative
of course the movie was made eleven years later the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts peter frampton is the one and only billy shears and aside from being about a rock band the story doesnt correlate to the song at all,negative
and oh what joy were the lovely audience theyd like to take home with them,negative
i dont think so,negative
but at least these characters are actually people in a beatles song whereas other characters such as strawberry fields sandy farina gets her name from a song about a place called strawberry fields,negative
the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes embarrassing cameo appearances george burns,negative
steve martin,negative
alice cooper and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70s fashion and faces,negative
check please,negative
the plot is a bit unclear,negative
people with bad 70s hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of makebelieve from an overly demented mr rogers,negative
mean mr mustard frankie howerd somehow gets hold of all billy co s instruments calling dr maxwell edison steve martin with a silver hammer and an outofkey singing voice the sun king marvin sunk alice cooper and a couple of creepy robots to his aid,negative
supposedly this is a horrible thing,negative
i guess in heartland the talent is pretty nonexistent,negative
meanwhile the lonely hearts are off doing the classic sex drugs and rock n roll thing leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love billy,negative
she sets out to find him leaving her poor dad and mom mrs,negative
fields,negative
hey wanna cookie,negative
all alone to sing a horrible rendition of shes leaving home accompanied by those same creepy robots,negative
but is billy getting it on with lucy dianne steinberg,negative
ya know the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky,negative
well theres some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop and i assume thats who it was,negative
its movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question what the hell were they thinking,negative
nobody will ever know but as a novelty sgt,negative
peppers is one to examine,negative
carol channing robert palmer keith carradine theyre all here,negative
but why,negative
who knows,negative
its irrelevant,negative
theres as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your bellybutton lint although the latter may be more interesting,negative
with the recent onslaught of 70s nostalgia in the movie world the ice storm boogie nights reissues of the star wars trilogy etc lets pray this doesnt get a special 20th anniversary secondchance in theaters,negative
in the words of paul mccartney live and let die,negative
in fact bury this one while you still can,negative
the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation batman and robin,negative
both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts but also their monosyllabic dialogue and emptyheaded character motivations,negative
in panelsized morsels implausible plots and rambo esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork but on thirty foot silver screens its much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures,negative
spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons white who is framed by a corporate baddie played without irony by sheen then set on fire and left for dead,negative
though the movie skimps on the next few plot points heres what i could determine said assassin then becomes the leader of satans army under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown leguizamo grating as always,negative
he is renamed for reasons unbeknownst spawn and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon,negative
but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child he realizes that he cant be the evil superdemon hes expected to be and he sets about avenging his untimely death,negative
typical of summer blockbusters spawn is an effectsladen ninety minute rock video,negative
while the visions of hell are laughably crude think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man spawns prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold,negative
but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion spawn longs for his wife but they dont have a single scene together before simmons death conflict who will triumph is not anybodys guess and believability not that i expected it,negative
so many questions are left unanswered and im sure they wont be addressed in the inevitable sequel,negative
while last years the crow city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative which was lazy and somewhat incoherent it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power,negative
spawn is an inyourface screaming banshee of a film these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid but they havent the faintest idea how to make a movie,negative
saving silverman is a good example of a good comedy gone bad,negative
as a love story it is good however as a comedy it falls flat on its face,negative
i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times and,negative
those were just chuckles at the most,negative
the movie doesnt have the oomph to make it a great movie and doesnt have the script to make it a funny movie,negative
wayne lefessier steven zahn j d mcnugent jack black and darren silverman jason biggs have grown up all their lives together they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end,negative
while in a bar after doing a show with their band based on their love of neil diamond darren meets a young woman named judith amanda peet whom he instantly falls for,negative
wayne and j d however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again its up to wayne and j d to try and begin saving silverman,negative
the performances are topnotch and surprisingly they are what keep the movie afloat,negative
jason biggs right off the flop loser does an ok job playing silverman but he is stale and flat at times,negative
steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier and even though the movie is about silverman lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself,negative
jack black is well jack black and he does an all right job as j d but he isnt as funny as he has been in the past,negative
amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith and neil diamond plays neil diamond hes better at singing than acting,negative
anyway the performances in the film are good but its too bad the script isnt,negative
speaking of script hank nelkans choppy script is not only badly written but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street,negative
the trailer for the movie as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie especially the funniest parts,negative
somewhere saving silverman was meant to be a good movie and it could have been but alas in the end it wasnt,negative
dennis dugans direction is all right he adds a few directorial touches here and there nothing special being a simple comedy,negative
saving silverman is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one,negative
it has a great cast a good director and a sweet story its,negative
just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie,negative
porter stoddard warren beatty is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie diane keaton for twentyfive years,negative
they and best friends mona goldie hawn and griffin garry shandling are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen town and country,negative
town and country has a pedigree befitting its title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry the graduate under the direction of peter chelsom funny bones,negative
after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates the media has been prepped for beattys next ishtar,negative
so is it that bad,negative
the answer is no,negative
but its not very good either,negative
the major problem with town and country is that its unstructured and random,negative
stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer having just bedded a flaky cellist nastassja kinski,negative
next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin,negative
then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings buck henry cameos as both couples divorce lawyer,negative
ellie thinks shes overeacting but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her familys mississippi manse,negative
the two childhood friends end up in bed together making us wonder why theyd never become a couple to begin with,negative
back home their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porters cheating on her,negative
porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that hes gay,negative
the four friends along with every woman porters dallied with all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after,negative
although the film begins promisingly resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps too many strands drift off into nowhere,negative
the stoddard household is huge containing two adult children josh hartnett the virgin suicides and tricia vessey kiss the girls their colorful bedmates and a maid whos just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home,negative
after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack the six supporting players are dropped except for an outofnowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son,negative
porters romantic misadventures with women other than mona are equally mishandled,negative
once the marital discord begins the film seems as if it was editted with a machete stopping and starting never regaining its rhythm,negative
while beatty gets off a few tart observations his character is mostly passive and bemused,negative
maybe were supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesnt initiate his own sex romps,negative
keatons ellie has a trusting nature thats a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character,negative
hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of the out of towners and the first wives club while shandlings relegated to true second banana status,negative
kinski is bland and unmotivated,negative
andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplays most bizarre subplot which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic wheelchairbound foulmouthed mother,negative
heston and seldes are fun as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party,negative
oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like hear my song and funny bones,negative
the script is this films weakest link its telling that most of the few laughs come from oldfashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit,negative
while town and country isnt exactly painful to sit through it mostly just lays there,negative
what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project,negative
most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films,negative
john frankenheimer who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60s recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin,negative
screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd,negative
ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes,negative
even charlize theron who i was convinced couldnt act did a decent job in cider house rules,negative
when all of these bright stars come together one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining,negative
after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games disbelief was my first reaction then frustration,negative
the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an allrookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining,negative
the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are,negative
it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights,negative
we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar,negative
the actors in that movie were having fun and from that the audience had fun,negative
reindeer games is the complete opposite the actors dont seem to want to be their characters even danny trejo who will do practically anything doesnt look like he is enjoying himself causing the audience to quickly lose interest,negative
evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled boy this movie is horrible,negative
and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments,negative
the story follows a man rudy ben affleck who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick james frain,negative
nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman ashley charlize theron and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person,negative
when nick is killed in a prison riot rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays,negative
unfortunately ashleys brother gabriel gary sinise interferes with their relationship,negative
thinking rudy is nick he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino which nick use to work at as a security guard,negative
now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel,negative
confused,negative
the movie only gets more complex as it goes on until it gets way way too complex at its climax,negative
but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour,negative
the hero commits a greedy selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley,negative
some hero,negative
the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing a person for the audience to relate to or admire,negative
when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times,negative
the most irritating part of the film besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason,negative
the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead,negative
the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food,negative
why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me,negative
why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me,negative
sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw,negative
yup its gotta be summer,negative
just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and directtovideo releases into port slams speed 2 cruise control the gloriously godawful followup to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed,negative
the gimmick this time is an ocean liner rigged to well crash into stuff,negative
sound exciting,negative
dennis hoppers disgruntled bomb squader the villain of the first film has given way to willem dafoes disgruntled computer programmer a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches i kid you not as a selftreatment for copper poison ing,negative
and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro magnetic fields no less,negative
calling dean edell,negative
so he overrides the boats computer convinces the crew to abandon ship and sends the remaining passengers those who couldnt evacuate in time on a col lision course with destiny,negative
oddly no one thinks to just,negative
jump off the back of the boat,negative
with keanu reeves electing not to return perhaps he read the script,negative
the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric sleepers as the second la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin babe annie bullock has dated,negative
what are the odds,negative
theyre on this caribbean cruise for pleasure as are a handful of requisite stock characters including a deaf teenager who has a crush on the hero who also knows how to sign,negative
and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move,negative
wait till you see the feats that this little girl can do when stuck on a shipboard elevator,negative
bullock is her pesky perky self though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests,negative
those paying attention to her bikini and tank tops probably wont complain however patric is the main man in motion and thats damn good cause when he stops to talk hes only slightly less monotone than his predecessor,negative
his first lol line is to ms bullock id like to boogie with you,negative
of course nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does,negative
he also produced this mess which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards,negative
con air buddy fathers day romy and michelles high school reunion murder at 1600 8 heads in a duffle bag anaconda vegas vacation meet wally sparks metro bevery hills ninja the relic all is forgiven,negative
worse hes spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesnt even live up to its title,negative
theres no sweatinducing motion of the ocean here just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of crosscut exteriors all leading up to the big slam when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town,negative
oh how far weve come in twenty years,negative
remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak,negative
admittedly either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission,negative
its just the rest of the movie the other hundred or so minutes thats pure nonsense,negative
and wonderful nonsense at that,negative
i know he didnt intend to but de bont has done one thing right hes created the handsdown funniest film of the year,negative
so now allow to present a few more things that made me laugh,negative
o a box with a big label fiber optic converter,negative
o plain english wholesentence computer instructions,negative
o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door,negative
o jason patrics character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything thats happening,negative
o a ships navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say i canna override it,negative
o willem dafoes amazing armmounted keyboard,negative
o two living breathing adults bullocks character and the first mate who have to be told step by step how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade,negative
duh,negative
o no wait,negative
screams the ships intercom,negative
o yet another damn dog in peril,negative
o fishing reel,negative
pontoon plane,negative
memories of weekend at bernies,negative
the first in a very long list of things wrong with i still know what you did last summer is the title,negative
think about it for a second,negative
if the last movie was called i know what you did last summer wouldnt the next movie have to be i still know what you did two summers ago,negative
if anyone working on this movie had an i q,negative
greater than five would have thought about it logically and said hey,negative
wait a minute,negative
but alas the people behind this film are obviously idiots so i wont hold them to that,negative
what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands even for a teenage slasher flick,negative
i guess im one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film emphasis on the kind of,negative
it wasnt great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good but at least it didnt have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like its sequel did,negative
there are just so many problems with this movie that its hard trying to figure out where to start,negative
first of all i guess is the setting,negative
the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting,negative
exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james jennifer love hewitt one of the only survivors of the first film and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up,negative
the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through,negative
in one scene julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress cant get out no matter how hard she tries,negative
when julie discovers shes going to slowly fry to death she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue,negative
now this is all fine and dandy except for one thing instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth why not just turn the freakin thing off,negative
in another scene one of the characters after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker says to julie just dont tell anybody it rained the whole time,negative
oh yeah ive just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered but hey ill crack jokes anyway,negative
after all it is in the script,negative
the films only saving graces are a few wellexecuted suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the reanimator himself jeffrey combs,negative
he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie,negative
way to go jeffrey,negative
i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept its head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson,negative
with scream and even its sequel he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter,negative
his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers and i think i still know has really suffered by not having him on board,negative
the cool atmosphere is still there this time around but i just didnt like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one,negative
even though the movie doesnt have williamson it still has a hacky ending trying to do what kevin did with the first two scream s by some may consider this a spoiler but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes having two killers and this time having one of them being a family member to the other,negative
i think someone in the audience put it best when after the movie had ended with another the killer is back,negative
cliffhanger he said who is this time the grandma,negative
all in all i still know tries to be as successful as the first the film was but really fails in the attempt,negative
i mean its okay when slasher movies ripoff each other but when they start copying themselves,negative
14 years ago national lampoon introduced us to a new family the griswolds,negative
in 1983 the griswolds embarked on a crosscountry journey with the destination of wally world a worldrenowned theme park in california,negative
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured,negative
two years later we watched again as they went to europe and four years after that we shared christmas with them,negative
now eight more years have passed and the laughs have done more than die,negative
theyve been cremated,negative
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold the good intentioned but illfated father of two,negative
the premise is basically the same,negative
clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation this time to las vegas,negative
his wife ellen beverly dangelo and teenage kids rusty and audrey always played by different actors this time around by ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick,negative
of course a vacation movie wouldnt be complete without good ole eddie reprised by randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong times,negative
there isnt too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it,negative
its really just a skit movie,negative
there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie which is not a real term as far as i know,negative
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours therefore coming off like a two hour skit,negative
the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits each lasting about five minutes,negative
vegas vacation comes off like the first,negative
a good example of the latter would be last years black sheep,negative
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast and it doesnt really fit into a movie mold,negative
in these cases a plot which is generally very thin is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags i e,negative
have a good vegas joke make a vegas movie,negative
such is the case with this movies miniplots,negative
clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswolds money ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie shae dlyn as an exotic dancer,negative
the simple fact is this movie isnt funny,negative
at first i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped,negative
chase plays clark griswold really well,negative
he made the character and he is the character,negative
dangelo to be quite honest never was too impressive as ellen and this movie doesnt show any signs of redemption,negative
as for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes to mind,negative
the vacation series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there is nothing to them,negative
theyre so generic youll expect the credits to read girl 1 as audrey griswold,negative
vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor,negative
yes its true that vegas vacation isnt even close to being close to being as funny as the others which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart,negative
first off why did they leave off the national lampoons heading on the title,negative
i couldnt find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didnt want to be associated with such a lame film,negative
thats saying a lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon 1 pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume theyd be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didnt,negative
there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact,negative
the first three films in the vacation series were written by john hughes a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80s including mr,negative
mom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris buellers day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck,negative
wowzers,negative
what a r sum,negative
looking at the names youd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980s,negative
well thats not all,negative
this guy also brought us 90s hits including the home alone series the remake of 101 dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber,negative
vegas vacation however didnt have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious,negative
this time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four madefortv movies,negative
vegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as a madefortv sequel,negative
if this sounds like a wild idea its not,negative
revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it,negative
vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 00 a m,negative
sunday morning movie but as a silver screen major motion picture its quite out of place,negative
stephen kesslers jejune direction doesnt help things either,negative
he only makes the film even more tvmovieish,negative
each consecutive vacation movie has suffered a drop in directing power,negative
we started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as cowriting ghostbusters,negative
not too bad,negative
then we had national lampoons european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hits look whos talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high,negative
lastly we had national lampoons christmas vacation directed by jeremiah s chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon,negative
kessler so far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in 1992,negative
granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get a movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal,negative
if you loved the vacation movies and i know some of us did there still isnt anything here worth seeing,negative
if you loved them dont ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte,negative
if you never did like the series why the need to confirm why,negative
in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the reallife incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa,negative
the twilight murders another one from the series is dealing with the case of gordon kahl played by rod steiger old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u s government,negative
after being released he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest,negative
when the u s marshals come to arrest him it turns out that kahl isnt alone,negative
many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist antigovernment beliefs and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that,negative
that brings fbi on the scene and agent mayberly michael gross is supervising the manhunt,negative
however his efforts seem fruitless since kahl still has many supporters some of them even in the local law enforcement,negative
after betrayed 1988 thriller by costa gavras hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising rightwing extremism in the american northwest and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing when media hype brought rightwingers back into spotlight,negative
until that time only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon,negative
unfortunately the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script,negative
sometimes like many american tv movies it creates drama where drama shouldnt be,negative
on the other hand film is steadily directed by dick lowry and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl,negative
on the other hand michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible,negative
however film does deal with potentially thoughtprovoking social and political issues so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldnt be the total waste of time,negative
the best thing in fact the only good thing i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l a confidential again,negative
or go rent body heat to see william hurt do some real noir,negative
or even god help me palmetto,negative
alex proyass new movie screams atmosphere,negative
i screamed too get me out of this theater,negative
new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors and doesnt have any way to get it back,negative
i paid 4 25 for a matinee screening and dont have any way to get my money back either,negative
youll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie,negative
i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning nightmarish future world where its always a late night in 1948 complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras,negative
ive got news for you fellows i dont care how hard you worked or how visually stunning this movie looks you wasted your time and mine working on a movie without a plot without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go without a soul or a reason to care,negative
the movie starts out ohsopromising,negative
john murdoch rufus sewell is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life would have been boarded up long ago,negative
there is a dead mutilated prostitute in the other room a surprise as he has lost his memory,negative
the phone rings its a sinistersounding man claiming to be his doctor telling him to flee for his life,negative
all well and good right,negative
wrong,negative
apparently someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot,negative
this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood,negative
so the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life rather its a voiceover narration by the aforementioned doctor keifer sutherland explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible,negative
its as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca,negative
no wait thats not fair to casablanca,negative
its more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show or if you want to know how i really feel having an offscreen narrator explain that gilligan wont be getting off the island in this episode,negative
from here the coherence of the plot goes down faster than insert monica lewinsky joke here,negative
the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason and thats what moves the plot,negative
what were left with is a string of unanswered questions that dont make any sense,negative
were given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed,negative
were given a hero who can tune into these same powers yet he only uses them when its convenient to the plot,negative
were given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere,negative
usually critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part isnt given much to do,negative
in this movie no one is given anything to do,negative
sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesnt remember anything and plays it like,negative
um,negative
a man who doesnt remember anything,negative
the aliens are tall pastyfaced and bald and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that theyre evil and theres a child alien as well straight out of an anne rice novel,negative
sutherland is saddled with a limp a twitchy eye and a breathy accent to remind us that hes in league with the aliens,negative
to its credit dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting,negative
william hurt is perfectly cast as the worldweary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city,negative
jennifer connelly playing sewells love interest is given two alltoobrief moments on screen as a lounge singer and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit,negative
but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script the way they would be in any selfrespecting noir movie theyre almost tangiential to the plot such as it is,negative
the problem with dark city is this its a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir,negative
the essence of film noir isnt as proyas seems to beleive breathy dialogue or snapbrim fedoras or tall bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner,negative
dark city has not one bit of intrigue moral ambiguity suspense or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics,negative
dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic,negative
its an exceptionlly wellmade and intricately designed piece of flotsam sailing around and around the middle of the ocean going nowhere,negative
so ask yourself what 8mm eight millimeter is really all about,negative
is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography,negative
is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of bigtown americana theres a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wont necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires,negative
or is it about those who can those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see,negative
im not talking about snuff films supposed documentaries of victims being brutalized and killed on camera,negative
im talking about films like 8mm and its director joel schumacher,negative
with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit batman robin a time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly has that kind of influence,negative
is 8mm something you really want to see,negative
probably not,negative
the first twothirds of 8mm unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama albeit with a particularly unsavory core,negative
then as its been threatening all along the film explodes into violence,negative
and just when you think its finally over schumacher tags on a ridiculous selfrighteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further,negative
trust me,negative
there are better ways to waste two hours of your life,negative
nicolas snake eyes cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husbands safe documents a young girls murder,negative
welles goes about his assignment rather matteroffactly and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost as if you dont need any specialized skills or training to do this,negative
welles certainly makes it look easy,negative
and cops obviously never look in toilet tanks for clues,negative
the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george c scott in paul schraders hardcore,negative
occasionally a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task,negative
there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly splitlevel home in harrisburg pa,negative
8mm doesnt condemn or condone its subject matter it just exploits it,negative
the irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walkers vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an rrated firstrun hollywood product,negative
so we only see snippets of snuff and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror,negative
later its the turn of joaquin phoenix whos quite good and by far the films most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again,negative
all this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviants are not indeed monsters but everyday people like you and me,negative
neither super nor standard 8mm is shocking only in its banality,negative
lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 episode 1 is a boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects,negative
after the familiar a long time ago,negative
opening the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game,negative
the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo ruled by queen amidala portman jedi knights quigon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade,negative
however this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park,negative
they also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd,negative
star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters,negative
the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic,negative
the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent,negative
theres no underlying tension and no urgent need to see what the outcome is,negative
the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story which doesnt help,negative
theres no snap to make the film work it moves at a plod,negative
the script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother,negative
theres no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders its evident that not much is going to happen,negative
the two leads are hideously boring static characters given little to do and too much time to do it,negative
quigon and obiwan hold no presence on film and give little for the audience to root for,negative
the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time,negative
maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy,negative
anakin is annoying and unlikeable,negative
instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended,negative
its probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible,negative
the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the film by him,negative
although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny,negative
the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a pod racer because i knew he wouldnt be able to talk for a while,negative
queen amidala is a nothing in the film she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people and go googoo over anakin,negative
again her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little to do here,negative
the actors dont help the movie much either,negative
liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible,negative
mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy with little charm,negative
the casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness theres little other explanation for it,negative
natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script but she delivers a spunky performance,negative
and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice,negative
theres very little talent evident with him its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there,negative
hes not even very cute,negative
the main claim of the film the special effects are okay,negative
theres nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well,negative
the cgi takes away much of the human element however,negative
the battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers,negative
episode 1 is just disappointing,negative
its got high production values but little else,negative
the music is meandering except near the end,negative
the plot gives us noone to root for or even care for,negative
the effects are nice but dull,negative
the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should,negative
theres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich s are catered for throughout the film,negative
apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film,negative
disappointing is barely the word,negative
rating,negative
i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick,negative
take the professional for example,negative
it boasts extremely glossy cinematography a couple of recognizable name actors and a couple of fairly impressive explosions,negative
its also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features a central relationship between a middleaged man and a twelveyearold girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension,negative
the professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant,negative
the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated,negative
one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door,negative
her name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d e a,negative
agent norman stansfield gary oldman after matildas father tried to rip him off,negative
leon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother,negative
the two become closer which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out to eliminate them both,negative
luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita a slick potboiler about a female assassin,negative
there is no question that besson can make a great looking film with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created a film chock full of moody closeups and evocative lighting,negative
but beneath the shiny wrapper there isnt nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe,negative
the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop,negative
leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits all intended to show us that for a hired killer hes really not so bad a guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of a potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies,negative
jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda,negative
natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality but she doesnt have too much to work with either,negative
besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing,negative
a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag,negative
gary oldmans entire part is something of a cheap gag wildeyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting to watch,negative
there isnt a real person to be found anywhere in the professional which isnt always a problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more,negative
a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelveyearold in a really distasteful way,negative
there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matildas relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely,negative
but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that hes going to show them a forbidden love story while choosing simply to focus his camera on portmans rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing,negative
this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol or the blood which is spilled aplenty,negative
a great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world cant disguise that fact,negative
plot something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and nonhorror movies,negative
oh yeah theres also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit but trust me you wont care much about the plot in this film,negative
critique parody movies either work or they dont and this one just doesnt work,negative
the laughs arent as pronounced this time around the energy level the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here,negative
its like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something wink wink,negative
and the scariest part of it all,negative
check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy seven,negative
i say again it took seven people to write 82minutes worth of fart jokes halfassed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror,negative
now im not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed funny sketch ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on saturday night live,negative
there are a couple of funny oneliners but mostly just rehashed onejoke scenes a lot of dead silence and lame gags,negative
add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here the films website isnt even up yet,negative
what the f,negative
i do however have to give it up to james woods the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all the exorcist takeoff miss this and youve missed any reason to see the flick,negative
i especially liked his oneliner as he walked in to see the possessed womans head turning,negative
very funny,negative
unfortunately the film plummets straight down after that with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude wheres my car and other action movies like charlies angels and mission impossible 2 now help me figure this one out will you,negative
isnt this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies,negative
or maybe thats just the title of the film fing with my head,negative
well im sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lameass script,negative
the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers money instead of the zucker brothers comedy for this sequel,negative
unfortunately for us all were left with here is a skeleton of a film which mightve been funny had it been worked over a few more times tightened up here and there and been injected with more solid laughs,negative
but as things stand now there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last years film has led everyone down this path so screw them for not trying as hard critically speaking of course,negative
you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough real effort into this chopjob and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents,negative
pooh on you,negative
thats telling em joblo,negative
sheesh,negative
btw im allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson whose massive breasts and skanky gstring had me chompin at the bit,negative
you go girl,negative
everyone else stay,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
airplane 1010 airplane ii 1010 galaxy quest 810 hannibal 710 the haunting 310 mafia 510 naked gun 810 scary movie 810 top secret 910,negative
vikings v bears,negative
no this isnt the lineup for monday night football,negative
rather these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in the 13th warrior a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory,negative
based on michael crichtons book eaters of the dead this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought,negative
their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword,negative
luckily for the vikings however their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film,negative
antonio bandaras is ahmed a travelling ambassador,negative
accompanied by his friend omar shariff in a cameo they eventually come across a small viking village,negative
we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude,negative
they laugh heartily revel in their arrogance and sing songs of battles won,negative
but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land,negative
help is needed quickly,negative
an elderly fortunetelling witch arrives,negative
after a brief incantation she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more not of norse blood are needed to ensure victory,negative
personally i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity,negative
nonetheless 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th,negative
the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives,negative
of course during their ride ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors,negative
but he ably shows that its not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog,negative
he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings but will his skills and that of the group be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside,negative
it does not look promising,negative
these creatures resembling bears are strong and have high morale,negative
they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies,negative
they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon,negative
the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods,negative
they are ready to sacrifice their lives,negative
this is a good way to die says one of the fallen warriors,negative
despite the largerthanlife battle sequences i was unmoved by the entire experience,negative
at many points i was even confused,negative
for example somewhere in the middle of the film a subplot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land,negative
he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis,negative
however the subplot never fully materializes and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion,negative
there are other questions that i had but the real problem was that the story little of it that there was offered no characters to love or hate,negative
the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma,negative
however banderass role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special,negative
an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order,negative
also much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night which made battles very difficult to follow,negative
i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy,negative
as it stands the film manages more confusion than intensity,negative
it would make thor cry,negative
starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing publicparticularly kids wanted to see,negative
therefore its with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas,negative
despite some innovation and risk taking the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes as are its characters,negative
a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the savages that live there,negative
the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust,negative
only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash,negative
the ending as it turns out is not entirely a happy one and is one of the films finer moments,negative
the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth,negative
governor ratcliffe for instance is a snobbish singleminded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses,negative
captain john smith is a blond hunk who while slightly misguided is good at heart,negative
pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time,negative
she even comes complete with insignificant best friend,negative
again against tradition talking animals arent used but a lusty wizened talking tree is,negative
this is an odd compromise but its one of the few elements that really work,negative
the animals are a delight and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation,negative
maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes,negative
the talking tree who seems to have a thing for john smith is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch,negative
the music a welcome delight in the later disney films is mostly a let down here with the exception of the catchy and motivational colors of the wind,negative
mel gibson as the voice of john smith has a solid singing voice and should have been used more,negative
the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character,negative
i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time,negative
even the children in the audience seemed restless,negative
while theres no stopping a kid from seeing something that they wantor disney wants them tomost i believe will be disappointed,negative
perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history,negative
its all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movies entertainment value but doing so to historical facts doesnt work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewers minds and plot holes that are never filled,negative
even the artwork another disney strong point varies greatly in quality making any story problems even more obvious,negative
as mentioned above there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film,negative
for instance if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with savages why did he so quickly change his previous kill as many indians as i can attitude,negative
if he was such a nice guy after all he should have changed his ways long before this,negative
or how about pocahontas amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men,negative
i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot history was modified in the film anyway,negative
as it is i wonder if it doesnt give kids the wrong impression,negative
in short the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set,negative
while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions they end up failing on too many levels,negative
marie couldnt talk paulie the parrot star of his own movie tells us about the daughter in his original family,negative
dad couldnt listen,negative
and mom couldnt cope so they got rid of me,negative
paulie the autobiography of a talking not merely a mimicking parrot has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird the voice not the body and as the minor character of benny a smalltime crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms,negative
as the parrot mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up,negative
benny on the other hand is a character youve seen a thousand times before and mohr brings nothing new to that role,negative
robertss deliberately slow pacing of laurie craigs script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems,negative
when a kids movie wants to mosey along watch out,negative
if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium,negative
so it is with paulie,negative
when they let their bird do his standup comedy routines the show hums and the audience roars,negative
too often however a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again,negative
tony shalhoub the smartmouthed chef from big night plays misha a recent russian immigrant to the u s he had been a teacher of literature at home but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study,negative
although misha gets a few nice lines im russian,negative
i like long stories,negative
his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy,negative
besides paulie the only character worth noting other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands is the speechimpaired marie played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer 5yearold hallie kate eisenberg,negative
naturally enchanting she gives the picture genuine heart,negative
the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half,negative
the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills,negative
when maries family gets a cat for example the bird who hasnt wanted to learn how to fly until then takes an instant interest in soaring,negative
tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time paulie calls him a stupid hairball,negative
their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation,negative
its good quality sitcom material but performed by animals,negative
when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing paulie cringes,negative
im a bird he explains with his frequently subtle humor,negative
i have a small brain and its about to explode,negative
the movie contains rich doses of john debneys dreamy music,negative
with heavy use of a solo violin he keeps reinforcing the films heartwarming themes,negative
and when paulie finally takes off in flight the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing,negative
its a long story says paulie,negative
its the only kind he knows reflects misha,negative
and the motion picture which runs the standard length for a kids movie still feels too long,negative
the best parts are enthralling but then there are all of those dead spots inbetween,negative
paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless,negative
paulie runs 1 32,negative
it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages,negative
my son jeffrey age 9 gave the movie with his biggest complaint being that there wasnt enough action,negative
he thought paulie was funny and the actress that played marie was quite good,negative
his friend sam almost 9 thought the movie was awesome excellent and gave it,negative
he thought paulie was good but he didnt believe the way maries speech impediment was acted,negative
desperate measures is a generic title for a film thats beyond generic,negative
its also a depressing waste of talent with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not to mention oncecool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of notcool flicks this thriller is more before and after than reversal of fortune,negative
the movie is a big disappointment and yet its somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it the premise is both promising and intriguing,negative
too bad the executions all wrong though because the setup of desperate measures boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use,negative
san francisco cop frank connor garcia is a single parent with a troubling dilemma his son matt joseph cross is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission,negative
even worse the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe michael keaton currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society,negative
connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery hes at first reluctant but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital,negative
when he does make a run for it connor offers close pursuit but for different reasons than his superiors including the crusty brian cox they want to take mccabe down while connor needs to keep him alive or all hope is lost for his little boy,negative
one misstep desperate measures makes is in its underdevelopment of matts illness,negative
whats needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow,negative
take for example a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital,negative
the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him and what does connor do,negative
he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight,negative
connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son,negative
whatever,negative
to be fair though the lack of story background is the least of the movies problems,negative
first and foremost is how cheaply desperate measures trades the potential of its opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour,negative
once mccabe escapes the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills,negative
there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away,negative
also the movie is so intent on giving you a hootinducing lipsmacking villain the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter natch that it completely casts garcias frank connor by the dullsville wayside desperate measures appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist and the movies headscratcher of a sendoff confirms this,negative
there is some good to be found amongst this mess particularly in the acting department,negative
cast against type michael keatons understated menace is highly effective,negative
although hes not given much believable to work with andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord,negative
joseph cross as garicias ailing son is surprisingly unsentimental and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos,negative
this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending but most is lost,negative
it goes without saying that desperate measures needs an operation of its very own,negative
if the 70s nostalgia didnt make you feel old the 80s nostalgia is bound to,negative
one of the latter set the wedding singer seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980s directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine,negative
the wacky fashions are here,negative
and the music,negative
and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times but it all seems tediouslyand too obviouslyinserted for the didntwedressfunnybackthen chuckle,negative
the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original robbie adam sandler is a wedding singer julia drew barrymore waits tables at weddings,negative
both are engaged however robbies fiance angela featherstone dumps him at the altar and julias fiance matthew glave is a skirtchasing speculator in junk bonds,negative
robbie and julia go through the expected upsanddowns as they realize they were meant to be together,negative
ill fess upive never found adam sandler funny,negative
whatever his appeal is ive missed it,negative
other comedians i dont get include pauly shore and pee wee hermanmake your own judgments,negative
the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself,negative
idol looks like hell and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup,negative
hes mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene,negative
were not supposed to notice that and were not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie,negative
other cameos by steve buscemi and jon lovitz provide the only real laughs in the movie,negative
lovitz is especially good playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbies postbreakup depression,negative
1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood two movies dealing with the same subject or to be precise same high concept,negative
in summer 1994 that high concept was mad bomber action thriller,negative
in few weeks thrillride of the summer actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes,negative
the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland where gaerity tommy lee jones ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material escapes from prison,negative
he comes to boston where he accidentally notices jimmy dove jeff bridges dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police,negative
few people except gaerity know the doves violent past when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose,negative
gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror directed specifically at doves colleagues friends and relatives,negative
dove who is just going to retire and start family now must confront the mad bomber,negative
while speed doesnt even try to bother with plot and characters using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story,negative
and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed,negative
badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all,negative
screenplay by john bateer and john rice barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama,negative
the plot is of course full of implausibilities,negative
the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual no matter how brilliant he is can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay,negative
those questions same as in the case of speed could be forgotten while the action goes on but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters,negative
because of them movie seems a little bit too long and boring at times,negative
the most annoying element of the film however is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber,negative
his acting is so overthetop that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself,negative
this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive,negative
the film have few bright points though,negative
some of the action scenes are fine which should be credited to director stephen hopkins predator ii judgement night,negative
and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of doves colleague,negative
but all in all blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous yet hardly unforgettable competitor,negative
synopsis backup quarterback moxxon becomes starting quarterback midway through his senior year of high school even though hed rather read slaughterhouse five than the playbook,negative
evil football coach kilmer throws away moxxons book though while the evil team physician injects painkillers into the players,negative
in the meantime moxxons kid brother forms a cult and a bubblegumblond cheerleader smears whip cream on herself to seduce the new star quarterback,negative
comments since i usually review horror and science fiction films i feel a little out of my league discussing this teen football movie,negative
pun intended,negative
thank you,negative
varsity blues was produced by mtv and it really shows,negative
several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adolescent male audience this crap was intended for,negative
the teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst,negative
the adults all have problems of course and as onedimensional characters they are all fanatically obssessed with how their local high school football team performs,negative
yes this movie represents high school life in mtvland,negative
this is a land where your health teacher is also a parttime stripper your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck your kid brother forms a cute cult your football coach is an uncaring obssessive madman and your friends lives consist of nothing but getting laid and driving around in cop cars naked,negative
all you as the main character want to do however is read slaughterhouse five and attend brown university in the fall,negative
well at least this is a little more realistic than mtvs the real world,negative
varsity blues stars james van der beek this weeks teen tv star making the leap to the big screen,negative
he plays the hick moxxon adequately though some of his emotional dialogue will make people chuckle,negative
you dawnt own mah life,negative
who would want to,negative
jon voight the stock evil guy in countless other movies is surprise the stock evil guy here,negative
but is he really evil or is he a product of society,negative
after all everybody young and old in this movie has no life whatsoever and do nothing but obssess over high school football,negative
maybe the pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil,negative
the films screenplay never answers this burning question,negative
at times iliffs story does show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes but before the audience gets their hopes up that there might be something redeeming in this movie they get trashed with another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game,negative
the movies pacing is slow and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from start to finish,negative
i suppose im being a little hard on varsity blues,negative
maybe im just a little miffed that i had to pay 3 bucks to see it even though it was dollar night at the cinema,negative
something about a request from the studio made the theater charge more money,negative
i found the film oftentimes ludicrous and boring,negative
three guys in front of us smuggled beer into the the theater,negative
i wished i had thought of that,negative
alcohol lots of it may have helped the viewing experience,negative
susan grangers review of american outlaws warner bros,negative
thomas edisons the great train robbery 1903 was the first western ever made and jesse james under the black flag 1923 first introduced the outlaw folk hero,negative
now more than 20 similarlythemed pictures later jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend,negative
the story begins as jesse charasmatic colin farrell and his brother frank gabriel macht cole and scott younger scott caan will mccormack and trusty comanche tom nathaniel arcand after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war return to liberty missouri only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown,negative
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron thaddeus rains harris yulin is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value aided by allan pinkerton timothy dalton and his infamous detectives who back then were just thugs who provided security,negative
but when ma james kathy bates becomes one of their victims jesse and the rest of the guys gregory smith ty oneal joe stevens form the jamesyounger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroads supply lines sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept,negative
plus theres romance between jesse and a spunky hometown gal lee mimms ali larter,negative
working from a politicallycorrect clich drenched sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers director les mayfield keeps the action fastpaced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can,negative
the choppy editing hurts but russell boyds cinematography luke reichles designer duds and trevor rabins music lend authenticity,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 american outlaws is a galloping formulaic 3,negative
its the wild west revisited as a date movie,negative
bad movies described as a swift descent into sinful pleasure decay and debauchery are hard to watch,negative
bad 2000s movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch,negative
shadow hours falls into the latter category a mishmashed train wreck of bmovie actors including michael dorn aka star treks worf an uninteresting plot vain attempts at capitalizing on the underground scenes of seedy los angeles and really really bad directing and horrendous music videoesque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out,negative
the film revolves around the life of michael holloway balthazar getty who is trying to restart his life with his onedimensional wife chloe rebecca gayheart after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions,negative
michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l a one night he meets a strange gent named stuart mr buckaroo banzai peter weller,negative
he drives a porsche smokes french cigarettes and drones on about life eventually coaxing mike into exploring the underbelly of l a together a tour of punk bars sm clubs and bareknuckle fights,negative
the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 the film then simply dissolves into a cheap ripoff of dantes inferno mixed with an old stephen j cannell television pilot,negative
the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus,negative
other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen johnny depp richard griecoesque acting of balthazar getty,negative
peter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesnt give two shits about it,negative
and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs dance clubs and brothels damn isnt anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood,negative
way back in 1984 a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city,negative
shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel,negative
isaac eaton producers peter alevey andrea mia shon greenblatt balthazar getty starring balthazar getty peter weller rebecca gayheart peter greene frederic forrest brad douriff michael dorn,negative
in our time,negative
in our modern world where the cool rule its hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming the man,negative
and yet film after film after film is based on his everlasting magic,negative
in warner brothers latest production shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away,negative
though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeares romeo and juliet its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york is very hard to associate with shakespeares poetry,negative
the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city the afro americans against the chinese,negative
the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered,negative
the afroamericans are immediately suspected but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers,negative
it is at this point that han the romeo of the story finds out about his brothers death,negative
escaping from a prison in china he returns to united states to avenge his brothers fate,negative
but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks he falls in love with a mysterious beauty,negative
the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy,negative
theres only a weak echo of shakespeares talent in this disappointing production,negative
and there are more problems besides its title,negative
of course we dont call it a deformation of a great masterpiece,negative
we call it modernization,negative
it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics without any car chases and gun fights,negative
this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing,negative
kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesnt need to be updated because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature,negative
and as long as love hate honesty and corruption do exist everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare,negative
i must admit that i found rome must die very confusing,negative
i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak since it is his first attempt at directing,negative
he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision,negative
unfortunately he completely forgot about character and story developments,negative
his latest picture is therefore visually impressive but intellectually hollow,negative
the love story between han jet li and trish aalyah and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified,negative
jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice,negative
their achievement save this film from being completely braindead but they are not actors and therefore can not act,negative
they are nothing more than two celebrities put together,negative
the other actors including isaiah washington russell wong henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances,negative
delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality,negative
but theres more than acting to worry about,negative
even with lis incredible skills in martial arts the action scenes though technically excellent are too long and story updates simply embarrassing,negative
to make a long story short romeo must die is not intelligent enough to be a thriller not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film,negative
it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to romeo and juliet so the film is completely stuck not sure of what to be,negative
and in the end its nothing,negative
there are no performances worthy of notice no interesting character or story surprises,negative
so again the only good thing about it is its technical achievement,negative
this film can boast of great sound fast paced editing solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences,negative
the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre,negative
it is mostly provided by aalyahs enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists that create a kind of ghetto feel to it,negative
but when i think back its not much i remember from this production,negative
as in almost every summer movie there are some interesting scenes but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects,negative
it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities simply because it doesnt have any,negative
for someone who has never read shakespeare its another popcorn film,negative
for those of us who has its a waste of money time and brain cells,negative
okay okay,negative
maybe i wasnt in the mood to watch a mindless action movie i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it wasnt as good as the others,negative
howewer the latest segal picture didnt look that bad and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash,negative
boy was i wrong,negative
in the first half of the movie we are already assaulted with segals acting he is not simply wooden he is like a wall gratuitous violence an incredible plot sexist and even more gratuitous nudity and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes,negative
by the end it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers,negative
not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense,negative
of course in movies like these there must be a sidekick and a love interest,negative
in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model in the movie which only functions as a supposed comic relief by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie,negative
oh of course she appears naked from the waist up and of course segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship they did not even seem to be interested in each other,negative
i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie,negative
often the villain saves the movie unfortunately the villains here are cartoonish stupid and unfunny unmenacing,negative
how many movies have psycho exspecial forces bad guys,negative
too many,negative
i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him the scene where we are shown the heros superiors are stupid the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand etc,negative
simply said this is moviemaking by the numbers boring and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience,negative
my recommendation if you go see it bring a watch,negative
youll be looking at it for most of the movie,negative
my,negative
rent die hard,negative
read a book,negative
stare at the sky,negative
do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid,negative
the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen once again dragged in by my friends which by the way liked the movie halfheartedly,negative
they probably like wrestling too,negative
possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk,negative
it smashed u s box office office records in its opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here,negative
but is it any good,negative
in a word no,negative
ill elaborate further,negative
the story is as follows,negative
apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on,negative
one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened,negative
see jurrasic park,negative
imgen the company that funded jurrasic park want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago,negative
realizing what a bad idea this is proffessor john hammond richard attenborough decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs so as to rally public support to preserve the island,negative
enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there,negative
so basically what you have is this,negative
two teams one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other trying to document them being forced to work together fighting for survival against the dinosaurs firm intentions on eating them,negative
a fairly good idea however its let down by one slight problem,negative
its crap,negative
over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring way too quiclky,negative
add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested,negative
it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like whats for tea and should you cut the lawn later,negative
yes you should,negative
its a shame then really that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park,negative
with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c g i,negative
dinosaurs the t rexs have to be seen to be believed there is nothing else to recommend the lost world,negative
a very dissapointing sequel indeed,negative
disneys air bud tells a boyandhisdog story with a twist the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player,negative
granted for a family comedy its not a very funny or successful idea to begin with but it doesnt seem to matter air bud is surprisingly solemn,negative
save for occasional moments of forced slapstick the movie wags its tale with a straight face not a very enjoyable approach,negative
if air bud had realized its own absurdity then it possibly could have been better,negative
here were actually asked to cheer a moment when the dog marches out to save the big game clad in two pairs of sneakers and even a jersey,negative
its number,negative
k9,negative
yeah whatever,negative
the movie opens as golden retriever buddy as himself escapes from his current owner abusive clownforhire norm snively michael jeter,negative
he ends up in fernwell washington where mopey newkidontheblock josh kevin zegers is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father,negative
buddy kevin,negative
kevin buddy,negative
once the dog proves his oncourt prowess kevins selfesteem rockets,negative
they both win places in the schools basketball team with the animal as their mascot,negative
but before they can make it to the finals snively surfaces to reclaim buddy,negative
everything plays out just as one would think heavy on predictability light on an actual story,negative
the movie follows a calculated chain of events kevins gloom fades snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yellerstyle,negative
okay that last ones a lie but at least it would have been a quicker sendoff than air bud s courtroom climax no joke,negative
theres even a fauxcute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleanedup to splish splash,negative
paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried all in the name of formula,negative
the end credits note that no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture,negative
that very well may be true and although to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight a movie cannot exist on feat alone,negative
but air bud doesnt seem to be interested in anything else,negative
a friend of mine insists he saw buddy a while back on a segment of david lettermans stupid pet tricks,negative
i cant think of a more appropriate connection this movie is a stupid pet trick,negative
blatantly borrowing elements from 1993s like water for chocolate and 1991s the butchers wife simply irresistible attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but more often than not comes off as laughable leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar t v s buffy the vampire slayer would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on,negative
things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda sarah michelle gellar a young woman who runs her late familys struggling new york restaurant runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air,negative
while out shopping she also meets tom sean patrick flanery a charming handsome man who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for and later when he decides to drop by her dive called southern cross for lunch she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him even though she is known to not be a very good chef,negative
suddenly amanda finds her restaurant on the edge of foreclosure rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths,negative
are amanda and tom destined to be together,negative
and is it not just because of the magical food but because they really truly like each other,negative
and what exactly is going on with the food she is making,negative
does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation,negative
simply irresistible is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy thats as flimsy as a slice of bologna,negative
it takes one jokethat people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual waysand recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes,negative
add in a music montage every ten minutes these are actually the best scenes in the movie which certainly tells you something about the film itself and what youve got is an utterly empty if not necessarily boring excursion,negative
the cast of simply irresistible is fairly good but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting,negative
patricia clarkson 1998s high art in which she played a druggedout lesbian is a standout as toms colleague and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue,negative
also of note is larry gilliard jr as amandas cooking assistant and buddy who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes,negative
of the main stars sarah michelle gellar is fine but really does often look like shes struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future he has certainly got to pick better projects than this,negative
the bottom line is that simply irresistible is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in midair an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene my mind checked out from the characters and the romance,negative
when i think about it in hindsight i should have checked out in the very first scene where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab,negative
now that certainly is what id call magical,negative
ladies and gentlemen payback is the most expensive episode of the equalizer ive ever seen,negative
gibson plays porter a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife deborah kara unger in an alltoobrief cameo and partner henry after a successful heist,negative
as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porters back porter miraculously springs back to life,negative
he makes it his mission as a walking dead man without a conscience to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot,negative
in a running gag porter demands 70 000 but everybody mishears him and assumes hes after the entire 130 000 haul,negative
in his travels or travails porter encounters several other onenamed villainous cretins like fairfax james coburn as a whitehaired millionaire thief and carter kristofferson as a brownhaired millionaire thiefthe kingpin of the obligatory operation,negative
helgelands film which was recut by mel the producer is devoid of an imperative dime store charm,negative
the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly a because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs and b because mels schtick doesnt evolve from act onehes the terminator stranded in a plot without a scifi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone,negative
payback should have been called playback its a 102minute loop of the same short sequence,negative
mel i want my money,negative
anonymous villain no,negative
mel shoots gun,negative
anonymous villain dies,negative
mel meets up with his hooker friend bello,negative
second verse same as the first,negative
its not porters singlemindedness that robs the film of snap crackle and pop as a character who has already died once he has nothing to lose and so much to gain,negative
the movie lacks danger,negative
the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep,negative
payback has a gritty metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months,negative
director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello so vavavavoom in permanant midnight to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig,negative
to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves,negative
perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonistsasprotagonists as tarantinolook what he did with the similar heroless botchedrobbery tale reservoir dogscould have pulled off this material a loose remake of john boormans point blank,negative
the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction all women are femme fatales even the cops are in on it etc and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas death is never in the cards for the main character etc but transcends neither,negative
plunkett macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony,negative
naturally this got me worried,negative
would jakes talent be inherited from ridley or tony,negative
if it was from ridley than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in,negative
if it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel,negative
unfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm,negative
carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett carlyle who is poor and unruly and captain james macleane miller a clean cut gentleman,negative
as the tagline clearly wants to make known they rob the rich and nothing else,negative
the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca tyler,negative
hot on both their tails is mr chance ken stott who wants to see them both dead,negative
plunkett macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose,negative
although undoubtedly slick and fast paced theres very little merit contained in the film,negative
carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair although their characters are criminally undeveloped,negative
it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes but not on the script,negative
the five screenwriters three credited have produced an still born movie theres very little development in the story,negative
also major events such as mr cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are are so rushed that they barely happened,negative
the story is a bit of a mess frankly,negative
the performances arent bad carlyle and miller are typical lads but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest,negative
her irritable stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on,negative
she looks nice though,negative
more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character he hams it up well,negative
ken stott is suitably evil as chance but again he is nothing but a flat character,negative
i didnt particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived,negative
although a disappointment in writing and a minor success in acting the film certainly look lavish with good costumes and wonderful sets,negative
but production design alone cant save a movie especially a movie as bad as this mess,negative
jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty with f ck this and stand and f cking deliver splattered all over the place,negative
the mtv editing and direction are flash enough but in the end decidedly empty,negative
plunkett macleane is a massive disappointment,negative
although somewhat enjoyable during parts its so light it could float off the screen if it wasnt just images on a reel,negative
theres no thought no development no plot just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to genxers,negative
although its a great idea update a period drama to the mtv generation its execution is awful and would more likely bore than excite,negative
sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless its hard to recommend plunkett macleane as a movie but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video,negative
give it a miss,negative
the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties,negative
produce something anything that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens,negative
the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here,negative
gross humor sex jokes silly sight gags more sex jokes,negative
and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder grosser and more outrageous than that last film,negative
what the film is not however is funny,negative
the plot centers around the return of dr evil who goes back in time to steal austin powers mojo a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austins pelvis which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies,negative
austin must go after him and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday,negative
i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original,negative
but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews,negative
i wish i had stuck to my first impression,negative
myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation,negative
and he has the talent to do it at least as an actor,negative
but the material he is working with here much of it his own falls short of anything resembling comic genius,negative
this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces a fivehundredpound fat mans butt crack and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old,negative
after some of these scenes one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention,negative
the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor,negative
for the most part i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show,negative
there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety,negative
the director just throws the material at us giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director,negative
i am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd at least the ones who have yet to discover literacy,negative
certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as in your face kick you in the teeth take no prisoners actionverb blah blah blah,negative
if you see the film and you find youre not laughing there is nothing wrong with you,negative
it just means you grew up since seventh grade,negative
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either a a prohibitionera remake of akira kurosawas 1961 classic yojimbo b a prohibitionera remake of sergio leones 1964 classic a fistful of dollars c a prohibitionera action drama with a completely original storyline,negative
new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category c than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons,negative
the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the real source material the dashiell hammett novel red harvest,negative
it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself,negative
this time around the man with no name is played by bruce willis a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico,negative
by all appearances jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border,negative
one is headed by an irishman named doyle david patrick kelly the other is run by chicagoconnected italian mobster strozzi ned eisenberg,negative
calling himself john smith the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyles side,negative
but smiths allegiance is as uncertain as his name and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them,negative
viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakescumbastardizations,negative
there is the happily ineffectual lawman bruce dern the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections karina lombard the barkeep who becomes our antiheros only friend william sanderson suspicious lieutenants christopher walken and michael imperioli to question the bosses trust in smith a brutal beating and a big fire,negative
director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity but at least he doesnt try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture,negative
what he does do is nearly as big a mistake and that is to provide a running voiceover narration by willis which rings of the standard hardboiled style of pulp detective fiction,negative
yes that narration is full of cliches but those are are not particularly troubling,negative
the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters,negative
they were a mystery to the other characters in the film and to the audience their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status,negative
with john smiths voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought he becomes more mundane just another tough guy trying to stay alive,negative
it feels like a hammett novel all right and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice but it simply doesnt work,negative
the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence and the man with no name takes no one into his confidence,negative
even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate i cant imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction,negative
willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else,negative
christopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of softspoken psychos and there isnt another single character whom makes even the slightest impression,negative
with no compelling antagonist for smith there is no buildup towards the expected showdown and when it does come that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about,negative
cinematographer lloyd ahern who also did the only noteworthy work on hills 1995 flop wild bill creates some nifty sunburned vistas but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counterproductive narration,negative
sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original theyll wonder what all the talk was about,negative
in the case of last man standing it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about,negative
first troy beyer wrote the critically panned b a p s,negative
now she makes her directorial debut writing directing and starring in this subpar film about women talking about sex,negative
though not without redeeming qualities this film is bad,negative
the basic story follows three single friends jazz beyer lena randi ingerman and michelle paget brewster in their search for love,negative
jazz has an idea for a local talk show it would feature women talking about sex and dating,negative
she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami,negative
the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters,negative
the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film,negative
there are several moments of bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension,negative
in a lowbudget independent film from a firsttime director these faults can sometimes be forgiven if the screenplay is fresh and solid,negative
that is not the case here,negative
the script suffers from random plot developments,negative
there are four or five of these turns in the plot each one raising the question where did that come from,negative
at one point a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother,negative
we are supposed to be moved but since the scene is completely unledup to we really dont care if she and her mother get along,negative
weve never seen her mother before,negative
we never see her again,negative
who cares,negative
whats worse these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy,negative
at another point a character announces that she cant have children,negative
apparently this is devastating,negative
we wouldnt know this because she never talked about having kids before but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her,negative
the scene feels like an afterthought its emotion manipulative and shallow,negative
these scenes grow worse and worse culminating in an absurd climax,negative
two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing,negative
one scene is a lovers spat between two minor characters,negative
the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax,negative
thinking on these scenes it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities,negative
but it does,negative
first it is original,negative
we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea,negative
its something i dont think has been the subject of a film,negative
second the interviews of the miami women are sincere,negative
taken together they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners,negative
the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes but each tile is some womans real experience,negative
neither the picture of women nor their picture of men is truly representative but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way,negative
at some level the stereotypes that emerge can be called true,negative
i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their likes dislikes skills and thrills but on the whole its pretty bad,negative
and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension,negative
ill give beyer one more strike and then shes out,negative
rated r almost got an nc17 for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity,negative
seen may 2 1998 at 3 40 p m at the crossgates cinema 18 theater 13 with chris wessell and sean oshea for 5,negative
theater rating 12 very good sound picture and seats,negative
the bigbudget megahype event movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one,negative
gluttony is hollywoods favorite sin but it is the moviegoers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an everworsening basis,negative
lost in space is the latest such offering a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre,negative
its made up of every element of science fiction but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for,negative
audiences attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films this one opens with a fastpaced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film probably because it has star wars written all over it but as the producers way of showing off their budget through the special effects,negative
battle scenes are worthless without tension and since we have no idea what the setting is its impossible to care about anything that happens,negative
in essence the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game not a piece of filmmaking,negative
we meet the robinson family a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earths behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources,negative
each member of the family has a special trait and personality and yet none of them seem like actual people,negative
professor john robinson hurt is the intelligent quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it its obvious what role this aspect will play,negative
of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other while the necessary problems are resolved at the right moments,negative
the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact its presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire and is so pathetic its laughable,negative
the first act is not a building of a story but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements such as plot conflict and characterization god forbid,negative
were provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent,negative
in fact it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually nonexistent,negative
yes the characters do speak but they do not talk,negative
they say things that only relate to the conflict but they never really interact unless its the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west leblanc and uptight unemotional judy robinson graham,negative
its amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens,negative
eventually the pacing rapidly increases but the amount of genuine interest does not,negative
the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr smith oldman the cartoony villain and his plans for sabotage,negative
what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts,negative
the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as alien lite,negative
the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive,negative
but theres never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly,negative
plotlines are developed but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario,negative
the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes but its presented in such a ridiculous way its utterly boring,negative
by the time the last act rolls around there is no sense of a payoff building,negative
the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax instead it seems to come to a sudden halt but at least it ends at all,negative
lost in space is major film production at its worst,negative
its frightening that a film so poorly written directed and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment,negative
i have a great idea for a movie one that cant miss,negative
see ive got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances,negative
its about professional basketball so ill release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity,negative
as for what the movie is actually about well that will all sort itself out eventually,negative
i figure it will be a comedy so ill throw a halfdozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with,negative
maybe well put a gender spin on it see if we can get some women out to see it too,negative
eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind,negative
twister as inane as the script might have been at least required some creative technicians mission impossible overwrought plot and all at least involved genuine effort,negative
eddie just sits there hawking up a formula story without any laughs and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required,negative
whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin a new york limo driver and diehard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team,negative
coach john bailey dennis farina has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas and the losses are beginning to mount,negative
the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess frank langella to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team,negative
the winner surprise surprise is eddie who becomes a fan favorite and eventually the actual coach,negative
the knicks continue to lose but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops,negative
incidentally the knicks eventually start winning,negative
please raise your hand if that comes as a shock and i will invite you to my allnight marathon of the bad news bears major league angels in the outfield the mighty ducks the big green cool runnings and little giants,negative
awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds its what they do,negative
those teams usually involve kids for a very sound comedic reason its funnier when they screw up and theyre more sympathetic,negative
those which dont involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles for another very sound comedic reason they generally have developed some sort of comic timing,negative
eddie was cast under the misguided premise that its easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players,negative
this finds nba players like greg ostertag dwayne schintzius rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players,negative
perhaps that all didnt matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick,negative
steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming dont blame me i just work here,negative
perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isnt a movie its a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while,negative
among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump new york mayor rudolph giulianni former new york mayor ed koch david letterman letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas,negative
and those are the real jokes in eddie,negative
nothing these individuals say or do is funny you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice hey its donald trump,negative
or hey its mujibur and sirajul,negative
its difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it cant even get the cliches in a clicheridden genre script right,negative
the knicks coach who is eddies antagonist early in the film reappears at the end but he isnt given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs,negative
neither is frank langella and none of the athleteactors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of,negative
that leaves her to do her streetwise miss thang routine but with no character no sharp lines and no help,negative
eddie isnt just a bad movie with a formulaic premise,negative
its a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy,negative
the happy bastards quick movie review,negative
the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really,negative
shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control,negative
sadly that is the case with kingpin a film directed by the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us theres something about mary and dumb and dumber,negative
since the duo directed and didnt write the script i can assume thats part of the problem,negative
the story seems good enough a pro bowler in the 1970s by the name of roy munson woody harrelson is sitting on top of the world,negative
his popularity has gone through the roof and hes getting his career off the ground,negative
then however he runs into ed mccracken bill murray a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for well anything,negative
these two form an illtimed relationship that involves risky betting and before roy sees it coming eds abandoned him and hes about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine,negative
forward seventeen years later where roy has become quite the loser complete with mechanical hand tornup car and of course the occasional knocking up of the uglyass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while,negative
however he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael randy quaid who has quite the bowling arm,negative
with the kids help he figures he can be known again particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno nevada,negative
of course the amish kid needs some coaxing particularly when you consider well hes amish,negative
this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film such as roys process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow,negative
finally the duo get on the road and along the way pick up an additional helper a beautiful hustler played by the gorgeous vanessa angel,negative
the main problem i had with kingpin wasnt the fact it wasnt funny,negative
in fact it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it such as the aformentioned above and roys explanation of not having children something involving a cheese grater,negative
but thats just it scenes,negative
theres a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie like the abuse angel takes from her hustler exboyfriend,negative
i mean was this really necessary,negative
couldnt have this been handled just a bit wackier,negative
i mean this is a comedy why throw ethics in,negative
particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle where hair gel can be easily mistaken,negative
that really ruined it however and thats too bad,negative
the acting is top notch especially from angel and murray and the really funny scenes are worth noting,negative
still if youre going to think dumb think dumb all the way through ok,negative
at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or id still be a little bit irked,negative
in 1990 the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of abovethetitle stars patrick swayze demi moore and whoopi goldberg,negative
eight years later moore and goldbergs careers arent exactly thriving but they have had their share of screen successes since the same cant be said of swayze who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog,negative
forget the mortal kombat moviesthis trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games,negative
good truck driver jack crews swayze must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey,negative
along the way jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstaclessuch as a highway weigh station evil truckers and deadly uzifiring motorcyclists,negative
every so often like at the end of a video game level or stage the main baddie pops up red meat loaf fresh from the triumph of spice world who wants to steal the cache of guns,negative
just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of whos driving what all of reds vehicles be it a pickup or a big rig are paintedyou guessed itred,negative
i could go into more of the plot specifics such as jacks dream of having a nice home with his family the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license the crew tracking the cargo but they are of little importance,negative
all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b but they fail at even this modest goal for none of the highway chaos as credibly staged as it is is terribly interesting let alone exciting,negative
once youve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time youve seen it every time,negative
as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen its that swayze has to reduce himself to such work,negative
while far from the best of actors he is certainly not horrible and he is a charismatic presence,negative
i dont know if its his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog,negative
regardless if he continues on this career track could a tv series be far behind,negative
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes,negative
but only a few years ago before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers,negative
sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south,negative
the way to regain popularity and prestige they thought was the use the same formulas characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place,negative
one of such celebrity was eddie murphy black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade,negative
in order to return to the spotlight he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film beverly hills cop 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987,negative
seven years later for the third instalment he used the directorial service of john landis another fading star with whom he successfully collaborated twice in trading places and coming to america,negative
this time however third time wasnt the charm and beverly hills iii was failure,negative
eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback,negative
eddie murphy here plays axel foley fasttalking streetwise detroit policeman who raids illegal chop shop,negative
the routine police action ends in tragedy when the criminals kill foleys boss,negative
determined to bring the killers to justice foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald timothy carhart,negative
when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles foley goes back to los angeles,negative
there with the help of his old friend local policeman rosewood judge rheinhold foley would clash with money counterfeit ring,negative
ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different,negative
in this decade the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film simply doesnt work,negative
screenwriter steven e de souza provides another conflict this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and businesslike professionalism of the bad guys,negative
since foley belongs to the former his character had to watch his language and the tone of the film in general is more infantile,negative
unfortunately this film still belongs to action movie genre and there is too much violence for little children,negative
nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath,negative
unlike donner with the lethal weapon series landis simply cant balance the comedy with regular action and the result is a film that fails in both aspects,negative
action scenes are sometimes interesting but not too spectacular at the end scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself humour on the other hand falls flat,negative
to make even worse some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure especially art expert turned into arms dealer played by bronson pinchot,negative
in the end although the film provided some entertainment viewers at least critical ones would probably be happy to know that there arent any plans for beverly hills iv,negative
the plot of big mommas house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress,negative
thats not just the highconcept premise its the fullyrealized allencompassing plot,negative
such an emphasis is not unheardof in the world of hollywood summer entertainment,negative
one need merely look back to last summer when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent,negative
the trap inherent in such an approach is that the highconcept plot idea better be pretty wellrealized or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time not a developed character not a provocative theme not a witty twist,negative
you will get 90plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress nothing more nothing less,negative
those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the onenote dud that is big mommas house,negative
others will simply stare mouth agape at its sheer unapologetic laziness,negative
lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john paul giamatti,negative
dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco terrence howard has escaped from prison and the feds think hes headed for his former girlfriend and presumedbutneverproved accomplice sherry nia long,negative
sherry however has fled with her son trent jascha washington possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ella mitchell better known as big momma,negative
indeed sherry appears to be on her way but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming,negative
that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows,negative
big mommas houses bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs,negative
doubtfire director raja gosnell edited that film and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom but theres just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main characters attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman,negative
unfortunately big mommas house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters,negative
suspension of disbelief in big mommas house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind stupid since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other,negative
of course laughs trumps logic every time and big mommas house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny,negative
and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foultempered beast while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry,negative
unfortunately no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another very different real person so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags malcolm reacting violently to big mommas explosive diarrhea attack malcolmasmomma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife one of the few sequences that works,negative
martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times but theres no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character,negative
hes just big momma without the makeup on,negative
i wont waste time commenting on how ineptly the setup of the escaped convict is employed since it was clearly a waste of time to the filmmakers,negative
there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure but hes ultimately a distraction in a film thats really about its central visual incongruity and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia longs posterior,negative
im never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing but i know that when a filmmaker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that its an entire film i duck out of the way,negative
the gross implausibility of big mommas house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big cleverlyconstructed laughs,negative
its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant,negative
big mommas house is ridiculous and not funny,negative
its just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress,negative
heres something to chew on whats the favorite food of big cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising,negative
the obvious answer to this question is cardboard because thats the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature,negative
deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer,negative
in fact considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas perhaps it was,negative
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore,negative
not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh both human and nonhuman been scattered in all directions,negative
we learn some bloody trivia as well such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains and what it does with halfdigested leftovers,negative
i suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre but it doesnt do much for me,negative
on the surface and thats about the only level at which this film can be analyzed deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic everyone else is citing the equally valid connection since james cameron directed both,negative
in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin,negative
the film is not humorous tense or exciting,negative
in fact its downright boring and despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ deep rising feels like the longer movie,negative
is it really necessary to say anything about the plot,negative
probably not since its easy to guess but ill go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis,negative
the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship,negative
in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics theres finnegan treat williams the boats pilot whos supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff joey kevin j oconnor the inept sidekick whos supposed to be lovable and funny but is really just irritating and hanover wes studi the mastermind and i use that term lightly of the operation,negative
their goal attack a cruise ship clean out the safe then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes,negative
the problem is by the time they reach the argonautica the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste,negative
aside from a beautiful jewel thief famke janssen and a couple of crew members theres no one on board,negative
the reason soon becomes obvious the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles,negative
the cast which is led by treat williams is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes two exceptions wes studi best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans and djimon hounsou amistads cinque,negative
williams once a cant miss prospect in hollywood has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career,negative
famke janssen who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye is the perfect bland match for williams,negative
given her limited acting abilities its likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes,negative
unfortunately a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet teeshirt for half of the picture,negative
meanwhile kevin j oconnor who has entirely too much screen time exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard,negative
these days audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computergenerated special effects,negative
this is a lesson that stephen sommers who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book needs to learn,negative
the days of jurassic park when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen are past,negative
now moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic visuals that are so wellincorporated that its impossible to tell where they end and where reality begins,negative
in deep rising the monster like everything is artificial and unconvincing,negative
unfortunately the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isnt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre although to be fair deep rising is a particularly bad entry,negative
even once this film has sunk out of sight the knowledgeable viewer knows it wont be the last of its kind,negative
like the slimy slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies more are waiting just around the corner in ambush,negative
and that consideration unlike anything on screen is truly horrifying,negative
one of the responses those that enjoy detroit rock city probably kiss fans mostly might have upon first glance at the rating ive given the film might be something like oh that caseys gone and become a jaded critic on us,negative
just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n roll movie like this,negative
im wondering the same thing,negative
i feel like i should have had a grand time with detroit rock city,negative
its the sort of movie i wish i couldve had a lot of fun with but i didnt,negative
i just didnt,negative
surely this film isnt trying to win any major awards so should i have expected an oscarcaliber film,negative
no but i expected something,negative
a funny joke,negative
a clever prank,negative
a plot development,negative
anything,negative
the movie never delivers,negative
youve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing,negative
detroit rock city is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the films existence and its not a very satisfying realization,negative
the film is about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit michigan,negative
thats it,negative
there is no big plot description in this review because the movie has very little plot,negative
the characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington,negative
they have a garage band,negative
theyre pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock n roll so i guess that means we root for them,negative
they have tickets they lose them,negative
they get more tickets they lose those too,negative
they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets most of which backfire,negative
theres not much more to it,negative
frankly it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity,negative
oh and jam real name jeremiah has a really really annoying ultrareligious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency,negative
she doesnt want them to see kiss if you hadnt figured that out already,negative
its really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this,negative
weve got plenty of kiss along with some ramones and thin lizzy,negative
then again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big fan that i am but is probably one of the worst movies of all time,negative
detroit rock city doesnt quite reach that level of ineptitude but it gets dangerously close,negative
in fact the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind,negative
basically the soundtrack has earned the film a full halfstar which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose halfhearted cover of s highway to hell sounds like something my neighbors cat coughed up,negative
its also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste because it s evident that theyre all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie,negative
edward furlong has done far better work than this and so has natasha lyonne and so has lin shaye but hey theyve got to make a living in hollywood,negative
people wanting to see kiss and lots of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song,negative
too bad they might have provided some energy to this mess,negative
director adam rifkin knows he hasnt got much material to work with so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning,negative
we get an endless parade of quickcuts splitscreens zoomouts zoomins and rotating cameras all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script,negative
its fun for a while but eventually it becomes disorienting,negative
i would recommend that those who felt seasick at the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing on this baby,negative
i havent felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since armageddon,negative
and what about that script,negative
its written by carl j dupr which sounds like as madeup a name as ive ever heard,negative
if it is i cant say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible,negative
a plotless pointless rock n roll movie can be fun if the jokes and gags are actually funny,negative
the jokes in detroit rock city rarely are,negative
in fact the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuanalaced pizza and that was just because it was so surreal,negative
the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it comedy,negative
there is no setup just a succession of punchlines that dont provide for much in the way of chuckles precisely because there was no setup,negative
its as if they just whacked someone on the head pointed at him and said see,negative
funny,negative
look that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink,negative
see,negative
funny,negative
look that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver,negative
twice,negative
see,negative
funny,negative
look that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money,negative
see,negative
funny,negative
a word of advice to mr dupr no these things arent funny all by themselves,negative
they must be preceded by a clever setup so the audience hasn t predicted them five minutes in advance,negative
thats it ive said enough about this movie,negative
its a waste of time and money,negative
i liked the music but dont bother buying the soundtrack,negative
i hear it s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie,negative
you want to see this concept executed well,negative
go rent roger cormans 1979 classic rock n roll high school,negative
it features another lateseventies rock band the ramones and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show,negative
yes go rent that and skip detroit rock city which will probably bomb and deservedly so,negative
i cant recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota,negative
for forty minutes or so i was lured into a loopy if occasionally overwrought romantic comedy and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt,negative
then rather suddenly i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence shortly thereafter i was whacked in the gut by another,negative
feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated as though i had trusted writerdirector steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face,negative
feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie cameron diaz who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red delroy lindo suspects her of stealing from him,negative
reds punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper sam clayton vincent donofrio who is far from the man of freddies dreams,negative
enter jjaks keanu reeves sams estranged younger brother who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddies eye and have sex with her in the bathroom,negative
united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam jjaks and freddie take off together but sam isnt ready to let them go without a fight,negative
freddie meanwhile isnt ready to let sams money go without a fight and thus begins a series of violent confrontations,negative
there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sams intense sibling rivalry as boys and their mother tuesday weld sending jjaks away to live with his father,negative
it does a great job of setting up jjaks unstable life a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks,negative
the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin,negative
most important baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements i will dare on the car radio,negative
you would have every reason to expect that relationships both familial and romantic would be the focal point of feeling minnesota,negative
unfortunately you would be dead wrong,negative
i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding but i certainly didnt expect what i got,negative
what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality or rather creating gags about brutality,negative
suddenly the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable,negative
the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another but there is no consistency to the characterizations,negative
vincent donofrio turns in a manic performance as sam whose jealousy competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood,negative
there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully jonathan demmes something wild and neil jordans the crying game come to mind but they didnt try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment,negative
i dont want to dismiss baigelmans successes out of hand he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop and some wellcrafted comic moments and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a lighthearted caper,negative
it is his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value and that he cant make his two halves into a whole,negative
feeling minnesota left me feeling used and theres not much funny about that,negative
renee zellweger stars as sonia a young jewish wife and mother frustrated by the constraints of her hasidic community in brooklyn,negative
her husband glenn fitzgerald is a religious scholar whose allinadayswork attitude on sex fails to tame the fire she feels within as so she confesses to the rebbe after hearing her fiery confession the rebbe suddenly gets frisky with his pleasantly surprised wifeand dies the next morning,negative
sensing her frustration her husbands brother christopher eccleston gives her a job in his jewelry brokering business in exchange for raw passionless sex that just fans sonias stillburning flame,negative
on the job sonia befriends ramon allen payne a cool blast of hunky puerto rican water who does his own jewelry designs when not working as a grunt in an upscale jewelry store,negative
can firetaming be far be that far behind for the eversmoldering sonia,negative
just about everything in writerdirector boaz yakins rings false starting with the improbably cast zellweger who does an adequate enough acting job but simply looks too waspy for the role,negative
a better fit would have been julianna margulies who outshines zellweger as sonias takenocrap sisterinlaw,negative
some of sonias baby steps toward liberation such as indulging in a nonkosher egg roll in chinatown come off as silly,negative
yakin attempts to spice up the proceedings with a touch of magical realismin the form of the recurring presence of sonias longdead brothers ghostmake the story feel even more trite than it already is,negative
i didnt know what to expect,negative
its like something you chase for so long but then you dont know how to react when you get it,negative
i still dont know how to react,negative
michael jordan on winning his first nba championship in 1991 or,negative
my thoughts after meeting him on november 21 1997,negative
let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official and even unofficial james bond series,negative
it is so full of selfparody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof,negative
an omen of what is to come is provided by the precredits sequence a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man its difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie and the assassin of the title,negative
a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows and the rest of the movie is even worse,negative
the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual ruletheworld so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin francisco scaramanga christopher lee putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moores 007,negative
there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95 efficiency,negative
its as much of a mess as it sounds,negative
bond is helped in his task by mary goodnight ekland whose character couldnt possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo,negative
during the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever,negative
maud adams later to star in octopussy is a much more stronger and useful character but she hardly features in the movie,negative
scaramangas lackey is a dwarf called niknak who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures,negative
worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie,negative
there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists another misguided attempt at humour,negative
the solitary car chase might have been a highlight but the action is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff j w,negative
pepper played by clifton james of live and let die fame yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window,negative
he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie,negative
even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge could have been except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print,negative
on top of that debacle the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramangas funhouse,negative
the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series the infinitely superior the spy who loved me a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive,negative
synopsis blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs,negative
in the meantime someone sends sarah rotting flowers puts her name in the newspapers obituary column and kills her cat,negative
comments never talk to strangers a colossal waste of time moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film,negative
one wouldnt think that two genuine movie stars antonio banderas evita and rebecca de mornay hand that rocks the cradle and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller saturday night live would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey,negative
not only are they in it however but de mornay executive produced it,negative
what was she thinking,negative
never talk to strangers centers upon sarah a psychologist examining the illtempered max a murderer soon to stand trial,negative
she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood,negative
two men woo her tony the security consultant wins her over so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music,negative
a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah and instead offers several male characters as red herrings,negative
86 minutes the running time of this cinematic mess thus seem like 86 hours,negative
a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony,negative
why would the careerminded professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony,negative
thats one of the films mysteries which are never answered,negative
regardless of motive de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism,negative
they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally in one of the stupidest scenes of the film tony takes sarah to a carnival thats right outside his dingy apartment that way they can hurry back and have sex quickly,negative
also apparently the weather changes quickly in their locale theyre at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex the next day theyre out playing in the snow before having sex,negative
the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarahs character development,negative
someone is out to get poor sarah though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts,negative
rotting flowers a writeup in the obituary and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her,negative
suspense cliche number one also occurs whenever someone is stalked in thrillers by any means if the stalked has a pet that pet will die,negative
oftentimes to even further the cliche the murdered pet is a cat suspense filmmakers for some reason just dont like cats,negative
sarah in never talk to strangers receives a package and lo and behold discovers her mutilated cat within,negative
suspense at its very derivative,negative
as stated before never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornays bodies as often as possible,negative
comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here hes not given lines that are suitable for his persona and doesnt even appear all that much,negative
maybe in a way hes lucky for that,negative
early on in the movie sarah tells tony after meeting him in a supermarket that she had been advised to never talk to strangers,negative
allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker,negative
1989s major league was a delightful surprise,negative
i didnt expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable but it proved to be fresh and funny,negative
however when the appeal of a movie is its freshness the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale,negative
thats certainly true of major league ii and the most recent entry major league back to the minors,negative
the title is of course a contradiction,negative
shouldnt it be minor league,negative
that contradiction suggests the lengths to which john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie,negative
original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger who returned for major league ii are not around leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie,negative
the other veterans who return dennis haysbert as voodooinspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka who was introduced in league ii seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise,negative
the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf,negative
the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell scott bakula who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn bernsen to manage the twins aaa team the buzz,negative
you can write the movie from here he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win,negative
theres a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing walton goggins an exballet dancer kenneth johnson a brokendown old timer thom barry twin outfielders both named juan the difilippo triplets and a couple pitchers with throwing problems judson mills and peter mackenzie,negative
along the way gus picks up cerrano and tanaka gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs even though he wasnt in either of the preceding films,negative
sum total none,negative
the entire enterprise is artificial and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors,negative
gus antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ted mcginley,negative
leonard is a slimy sniveling little egotist and the twins are lazy spoiled and full of themselves,negative
even watching the first movie i wondered why any reallife team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner,negative
gus challenges leonard to a match the buzz vs the twins,negative
wanna guess who wins,negative
back to the minors is a movie that has no reason to exist,negative
theres hardly a laugh in it the cast is weak and the first movie left no room for even one sequel,negative
by the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the 22minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered,negative
after all jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines,negative
the first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead r lee ermey facing a hotlycontested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction,negative
as olmstead begins his investigation we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects,negative
lane dixon jared leto is an enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination,negative
all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the others protagonist,negative
but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse,negative
lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years,negative
hes not supposed to be tracking him any more according to the bureau theyve got their man but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise,negative
two months earlier lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere,negative
lacrosse knows his killers work and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game,negative
it wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence but its a pretty good place to start,negative
theres a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center as a dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation,negative
we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tightjawed sourpuss pucker we can tell hes grim because every word comes out in an eastwoodesque rasp,negative
a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character pulling the audience into his haunted intensity making switchback his film,negative
quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated,negative
its tough to become emotionally invested in a characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes,negative
even without quaid it doesnt appear that switchback would have stayed on course,negative
the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy building our curiosity over which man the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor is the real threat,negative
unfortunately stuart tips his hand far too early in the game both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal,negative
once the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable,negative
in fact stale and predictable describes the direction that switchback takes in general falling back on fartoocommon hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere a climactic fistfight on board a freight train and edgy law enforcement agents,negative
its too bad stuart wasnt willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film,negative
played with atypical restraint by r lee ermey hes a wonderful unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions,negative
a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a filmmaker willing to take a few risks with his casting and storytelling,negative
instead stuart places his trust in a name star who cant carry the material,negative
maybe next time hell throw away that one crucial page in the script the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story,negative
do the folks at disney have no common decency,negative
they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects embarrassing writing and kidfriendly slapstick,negative
wasnt mr magoo enough people,negative
obviously not,negative
inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment,negative
younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80minute exercise in glaring stupidity,negative
the movie is poorly edited grossly manipulative and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle,negative
all the elements are there but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite,negative
as a huge fan of the 80s animated tv show the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain,negative
in the cartoon dr claw was a frightening raspyvoiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer,negative
we never saw his face he simply sat back in his armchair watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat,negative
as a child i always imagined what dr claw would appear as and this curiosity kept me watching for many years,negative
with the release of the liveaction movie the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed its,negative
rupert everett,negative
only now dr claw is simply known as claw one word he explains like madonna,negative
he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove and seems far less interesting than the animated version,negative
it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic but he overplays the role entirely too far,negative
when all is said and done this wasnt a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters the infamous dr claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool,negative
he does still have his cat though,negative
in the title role matthew broderick looks lost,negative
the actor while usually downright charming doesnt know exactly where to take his character a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers,negative
broderick first plays a friendly naive security guard named john brown who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people,negative
he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda joely fisher who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics,negative
but one fateful night her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire everett who wants to take over the world,negative
john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames,negative
in a full body cast he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brendas work a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys,negative
and so is born inspector gadget,negative
as bad as this movie is it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes,negative
broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city,negative
and there are about two or three amusing punch lines the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming this is why i left tokyo,negative
alas the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle,negative
there are so many tired plot additions,negative
gadgets talking car voiced by d l,negative
hughley is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian,negative
both are wisecracking nonhuman additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children,negative
well it just doesnt work in fact zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this,negative
and dont even get me started about the villains,negative
i didnt mind everetts performance but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust,negative
the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles,negative
penny michelle trachtenberg and brain the dog now have little to do with the action and chief quimby dabney coleman has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action,negative
the special effects are everywhere but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over,negative
the problem here lies solely in the script,negative
perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancyschmancy visuals,negative
here is one critic crossing his fingers anyway,negative
dont get me wrong i tend to appreciate bessons naive unashamedly romantic worldview an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood,negative
his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman and 1997s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love luv thats even more of a hoot on repeated viewings,negative
but his joan of arc is a mess despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a closecropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself,negative
jovovich bessons own personal muse through the making of his last two films though theyve since separated is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior but also a fabulous supermodellevel babe,negative
and besson remains a servicable action film director though not an especially facile one,negative
leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english joans struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring and besson helps you understand how the french could believe fervently that god is on her side,negative
bessons big mistake i think is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject,negative
yes joan had visions but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blueeyed christ figure on display in bessons hallucinatory dream sequences,negative
the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman billed as the conscience shows up spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell babbling like ally mcbeal,negative
thats kind of a shame since she does quite well up to that point charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness,negative
that darkly attractive aspect of her character that shes as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord is more or less betrayed by the final reels in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing shes overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady whos about to take a fall,negative
as the story winds down with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance,negative
trouble is hes chosen a lurid often jokey tone for the balance of the picture including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes and its impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is to a great extent nothing more than a puton,negative
this glib prefab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyers the passion of joan of arc 1928 a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joans trial and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema,negative
compared to that film the messenger plays as a crime against history,negative
directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich 1999,negative
theatrical aspect ratio 2 35 1,negative
this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james,negative
dick turpin sid james and his gang which includes barbara windsor and tom doc scholl peter butterworth terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies stand and deliver,negative
owing to the increased occurrence of turpins robberies captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners kenneth williams and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp jack douglas visit turpins area of influence to bring him to justice,negative
they are under the express orders of sir roger daley bernard bresslaw,negative
their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin sid james whom they confided in earlier they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies,negative
however once they catch harriett and put her in jail and sir roger daley takes complete charge it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin,negative
then again sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable kenneth connor to keep an eye on their prisoner,negative
there is no doubt that this is a sid james carry on movie,negative
he excels in double roles as in carry on dont lose your head and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious,negative
barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang and hattie jacques small but effective role as the rectors housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection,negative
jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying onscreen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part,negative
peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom and bernard bresslaws character appears only briefly in the film,negative
the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the birds of paradise and sporting a fake french accent,negative
when her girls and her are robbed by turpin she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit,negative
a carry on by the numbers this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie,negative
the jokes are bluer the script is poorer it is the last script written by talbot rothwell but the music is a marked improvement,negative
although nearly all the regulars appear they seem to be just going through the motions,negative
none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here,negative
just a selection of crude jokes and repititive doubleentendres,negative
from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong,negative
at reagan high four girls are sitting on top of the world,negative
courtney shane played by rose mcgowan holds the title of meanest most disrespectful soul in the school,negative
everyone hates her but everyone envies her due to her popularity,negative
courtney is the leader of her clique which also includes julie played by rebecca gayheart liz purr played by charlotte roldan and marcie played by julie benz are the other three in the group,negative
it is lizs seventeenth birthday and julie courtney and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her but the prank results in the death of liz,negative
just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else,negative
and also just like in other teen directed movies one of the four dont agree with hiding it this time that character being julie,negative
and finally just like in other teen movies there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth,negative
this time that character being fern mayo judy greer who is subject to many cracks from courtneys group as well as the entire school,negative
from here jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge bad morals and at least trying to do the right thing,negative
not only is the script weak on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast,negative
judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional annoying character as she overacts every line she has,negative
also on the bad side of acting is julie benz almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers,negative
on the positive side of acting rose mcgowan performs well here but doesnt match her wickedly clever performance as tatum in 1996s scream,negative
mcgowans role is annoying but this only adds to the film,negative
she is wickedly mean and even though she a wellwritten character you downright hate her,negative
faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart who is always exceptionally believable as her roles,negative
when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character she turns it into three always putting strong emotion and power into her roles,negative
gayheart isnt given as much to do here as she was in 1998s urban legend but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker,negative
jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in,negative
we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident and get into things that dont have anything to do with the actual film,negative
the beginning and ending are strong its just the middle that needs a lot of help,negative
during the body of the movie it is undeniably repetitive never progressing towards a conclusion,negative
nothing to grab the viewers interest is around and the same extremely annoying song plays over and over again,negative
jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless but falls flat,negative
the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang,negative
all in all a horrible disappointment,negative
the bottom line the tagline reads even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside,negative
yes that is too true,negative
no matter how good this film may have looked it fails to deliver,negative
for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood movie which are star vehicles are terrible things,negative
as a rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor,negative
an actor might be chosen on the upandup to give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck,negative
generally though the actor doesnt matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz,negative
the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less,negative
russell plays todd a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought,negative
the movie lets us see this degenerate process but by the time the real plot starts were into todds later years,negative
hes about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth,negative
the pride of this class caine 607 jason scott lee will be our villain and you know hes the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movies start,negative
between the two leads less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken and its possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction,negative
director paul anderson who helmed last years icy thriller event horizon doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam,negative
todd upon being replaced is left to die on a garbage planet but in order to stretch the running time out the villains return to the garbage planet on a routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight,negative
events are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here,negative
the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be todd fails to show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry,negative
its not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it,negative
the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as a parody of typical action fare like universal soldier,negative
a strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style class or substance and by next year a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television,negative
unfortunately it doesnt get much more formulaic than one tough cop,negative
theres the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain,negative
the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film,negative
bo dietl pronounced deedle baldwin is one tough cop a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia,negative
on top of that problem he has a drunk gambling addicted partner penn who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets i guess cops arent immune,negative
then throw into the mix the femme fatale gershon,negative
right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama,negative
but right in the middle of the film they throw in a completely unrelated plot point,negative
dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from,negative
the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death,negative
once the case is solved the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue,negative
whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably,negative
aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso an insult if you ask me the performances were pretty good,negative
baldwin though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec does a fine job as one tough cop,negative
penn who also slips into an impression of his brother sean is even better as a loser tough guy cop,negative
what one tough cop lacks is originality,negative
this film offers nothing new,negative
nothing that you cant get from any cop film,negative
it screams sidney lumet all over the place perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman producers of lumets dog day afternoon and serpico,negative
but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film,negative
too much else is lacking,negative
i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture something that i almost never notice,negative
but once i saw that i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot,negative
at times i was hoping to see it,negative
one tough cop isnt laughable nor is it a terrible film but it just isnt unique,negative
it is a classic example of a film that didnt need to be made,negative
but one thing is for sure it could really use a better title,negative
synopsis an aging master art thief his supplier and a young buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be or are they in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium,negative
comments this movie was boring,negative
plain and simple,negative
entrapment should not have been boring,negative
it stars sean connery who can still carry an action film despite his age catherine zetajones a likeable enough film presence and ving rhames ultracool star of pulp fiction and mission impossible,negative
it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears a current hot topic in the news in its storyline which is set at the end of 1999,negative
it has some genuinely wellstaged action sequences,negative
so what went wrong,negative
plenty unfortunately,negative
the major problem with entrapment is its script,negative
it has a beenthere donethat feel to it,negative
nothing seems particularly inventive or original so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags it runs nearly two hours,negative
the screenwriters for example periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes i e,negative
4 days to the millennium,negative
this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked scifi film strange days,negative
the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth surprise revelation is made,negative
entrapment in other words relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each characters true motive is resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion,negative
the star power here is quite strong but the viewer cant help but feel the actors are wasted in this production,negative
sean connery is given such mindnumbing lines as never trust a naked woman,negative
ving rhames character seems like an afterthought hes not developed at all,negative
the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zetajoness tight wardrobe,negative
this in and of itself is not bad but after a while it has a juvenile feel to it,negative
at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that theyre exploiting the female body,negative
entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her in tights arc and pivot around laser beams,negative
the tagline for this movie reads the trap is set,negative
it sure is on those who spent money to see this movie,negative
entrapment really isnt that bad it is watchable,negative
i would suggest however one waits until this is on cable or television to see it,negative
capsule godawful comedy thats amazingly shabby and cutrate and rather bereft of laughs,negative
i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers international man of mystery,negative
i desperately needed something to cheer me up or at least distract me so i could get a clear head,negative
get some perspective,negative
even dumb movies can do that for me sometimes,negative
i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery,negative
michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a fiveminute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of propsstrategicallypositionedbetweennakedactorsandcamera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago,negative
the plot what little there is of it back in the swinging mod hep sixties i dont think im doing a disservice to the movies attempted early look and feel by describing it that way sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr evil,negative
evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later when powers was out of the picture,negative
powers also had himself frozen and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with,negative
the basic gag that of powers total inability to cope with the nineties is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with,negative
the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics james bond gags of which this movie has no end right down to the silly character names inept slapstick toilet humor and strategically placed props,negative
the movies amazingly bereft of ideas come to think of it with a couple of bright exceptions,negative
one is dr evils son there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group chaired by carrie fisher and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch its a visual gag hard to describe and hard to recommend seeing the movie for,negative
a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie but its desperate rather than clever,negative
instead of skewering the whole thing its a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute,negative
myers himself is also desperate hes given an idea to play not a character,negative
plus the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy albeit nineties agent are a waste of time,negative
i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her only to have her deck him one,negative
with a couple of exceptions the movie misses all of its own best moments,negative
the movie even looks cheesy and not in a good way i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hidef video or something so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes,negative
the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap,negative
my definition of comedy is simply did it make me laugh,negative
the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out,negative
the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tysons shorts and sent it sailing,negative
the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by films end,negative
if youre not familiar with this law then maybe youve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by films end,negative
now if youre a regular reader of mine youve heard me say this countless times you know how drive me crazy is going to end but is the journey to get to that ending worth it,negative
no it definitely is not,negative
melissa joan hart from abcs sabrina the teenage witch likes a hunky stud on the basketball team,negative
adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor whos just broken up with his activist girlfriend,negative
apparently he wants to make his exgirlfriend jealous enough to take him back and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance,negative
so the two pretend to date for some reason but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud,negative
will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends,negative
will this crazy scheme work,negative
do i care,negative
the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy,negative
what makes movies like cant hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work and to a lesser extent shes all that and never been kissed is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly,negative
i dont know what the writers intention was with drive me crazy,negative
there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to,negative
here theres nothing,negative
just teens whining about whos going to take them to the big dance,negative
do me a favor kids go get a job or something,negative
just shut the hell up,negative
in all honesty the best part of this film is the end credits,negative
now normally when i say that its followed with the joke because the movie is finally over,negative
in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film,negative
after the obligatory second playing of britney spears titular song theres a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school,negative
nothing great but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them,negative
scifi fans take note there are brief appearances from stephen collins star trek the motion picture and faye grant the tv miniseries v and v the final battle,negative
pg13,negative
when i watch a movie like mike nichols what planet are you from,negative
i cant help but feel like everyone is looking at me,negative
its as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness eyes shooting daggers quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hardearned money to spend their time watching this,negative
this,negative
thing,negative
i shift uncomfortably in my seat,negative
im reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second or thirdrate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted funny conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award,negative
its not my fault i know its not my fault but dammit someones gotta be embarrassed because it doesnt look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame,negative
im about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols,negative
do any of these names make you instantly shudder,negative
the answer i would have come up with before today is no this is quite a list of talented individuals weve got here,negative
granted john goodman was in the flintstones and greg kinnear has turned in some lessthanlackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours but even so theyve got proven power as excellent supporting players,negative
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt his ingenious little its garry shandlings show and the larry sanders show,negative
and for gods sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty,negative
so explain this,negative
this,negative
thing,negative
what planet are you from,negative
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole poppsychology phenomenon,negative
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringeinducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringeinducing moments the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringeinducing thoroughly icky embarrassment,negative
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males they reproduce through cloning of course,negative
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find a female of the species and impregnate her,negative
theyre taught how to pretend that theyre listening by nodding and saying uhhuh and how to compliment shoes,negative
imagine my delighted surprise when oh heavens all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably producing comedic results,negative
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis since theirs after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence,negative
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that theyre all just clones,negative
whoops too late,negative
the penis when aroused tends to make a humming noise,negative
the writers when frequently strapped for ideas tend to turn to this as a source of comedy,negative
it isnt funny the first time,negative
it isnt funny the eighth time,negative
it isnt funny the eighteenth time,negative
if anything it made me feel vaguely selfconscious,negative
garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear who turns out to be a generic unlikable scumbag,negative
hes meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandlings alien character but hes so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside,negative
kinnears scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks,negative
wow,negative
what a magnificent bastard,negative
nearly every man in the movie in fact is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball,negative
when kinnears wife walks into the office there isnt a single guy who doesnt trip bump into a wall or otherwise pratfall as if theyd never seen a woman before,negative
the few guys that arent particularly slimeballs such as john goodmans detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholics,negative
shandling meets up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnears aa meetings,negative
shandlings mission is to have a baby and when he reveals his desires to her bening instantly falls for him and the next day,negative
they get married,negative
yup,negative
the next day,negative
cuz ya see it turns out she wants a baby too,negative
benings character perhaps was the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty,negative
if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole then woe i say to the species,negative
shes unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic,negative
theres a point where after thinking she may not be able to bear children she learns that she is indeed pregnant,negative
when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her she strolls into the kitchen and sings high hopes you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then says to him now you cant leave me,negative
were supposed to empathize with shandlings discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing,negative
and eventually shandling falls in love with her,negative
for real i suppose though im not sure exactly what prompted it,negative
whats the message i derive from all this,negative
men are liars inherently empty creatures but if you hang around long enough,negative
well maybe something will click,negative
ha ha,negative
ha,negative
im thankful such broad cynicism isnt frequently allowed to run so rampant,negative
lets all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one,negative
theres also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity,negative
goodman through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic vibrating penis,negative
it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition,negative
instead it just dangles limply on the branch for a while withers and falls away,negative
further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies,negative
but lets not dwell on this any longer ive already wasted plenty of your time and my own,negative
lets move on forget about what weve seen here and get on with our lives,negative
and to help us out lets end things on a happy note,negative
congratuations go out to annette bening winner of this weeks title,negative
award for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movies name,negative
a big house,negative
a big director jan de bont of speed and twister fame,negative
a big star catherine zetajones hot of the heels of entrapment 6 510 and zorro,negative
a big remake of the haunting,negative
and big special effects,negative
so what do they all amount to,negative
unfortunately for us a big bore,negative
plot a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old spooky mansion for controlled testing,negative
unbeknownst to the patients the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear,negative
critique this movie just didnt scare me one bit,negative
sure it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there but on the whole it took waaaaay too long to get going provided very little meat in the plot went way past its own bedtime and basically relied on grunts the muttering of childrens voices and overthetop special effects to scare us,negative
well this film didnt do much for me,negative
and they might as well have called it the haunting of lily taylor since shes basically the only character who had any real depth background or reason to be in the house in the first place,negative
dont get me wrong catherine zeta was sweet window dressing despite my continued perception of her faint mustachesee entrapment and owen wilson was good as the standard comic relief but come on people if youre going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks how bout giving them a little more than oneliners as dimension,negative
neeson was also wasted as the smart british guy,negative
its all too sad cause certainly the idea seemed like a good one see the shining 910 for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry but the story was thin the conclusion was laughable be gone poof and the special effects,negative
well they sure were nice to look at but not for a moment did one of them scare or even for a splitsecond have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry,negative
see it for zetajones or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going and provide very little payback otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld the shining,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars goofy actor owen wilson coscripted indie favorites rushmore 810 and bottle rocket with director wes anderson,negative
his brother luke wilson is also an actor who once dated drew barrymore for a year or so,negative
brother andrew is also an actor,negative
singer lisa loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character of olivia morice but i personally did not notice her,negative
she is well known for her number one single stay i missed you and goofy glasses,negative
the creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the actors,negative
catherine zetajones is currently dating flabby ass actor michael sex is my life douglas,negative
she stands 58,negative
in 1998 actor michael rapaport pleaded guilty to the aggravated harassment of lily taylor,negative
he was ordered to stay away from her and undergo counseling for one year,negative
actor bruce dern who plays the throwaway role of the gatekeeper in this film was once nominated for an oscar for best supporting actor for his role in coming home,negative
director jan de bont was born in holland and began his lengthy career as a cinematographer on films as die hard hunt for red october and basic instinct directed by another dutchman paul verhoeven,negative
actor todd field also played a small but pivotal role in stanley kubricks last film eyes wide shut,negative
he was nick nightingale the pianist,negative
this film was originally titled the haunting of hill house,negative
one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric youd better watch out for the skin deep,negative
id like to extend the same warning watch out for skin deep but whatever you do dont watch skin deep,negative
skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards,negative
john ritter stars as zach a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a bigtime drinking problem,negative
i never saw edwards comedy the man who loved women but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake,negative
you see to put it mildly zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets,negative
as the movie opens zachs wife alex catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress hairdresser,negative
like any sensible wife alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him,negative
in response zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking womanizing psychotherapy and selfdiscovery,negative
if youre turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink get arrested have sex drink crash his mercedes have more sex drink get arrested again drink and sing horrendously at the piano then skin deep should be right up your alley,negative
skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters,negative
zach is a rich 80s l a version of ritters jack tripper character from threes company,negative
like jack zach is clumsy and inept hes the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye,negative
zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him,negative
consequently i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis,negative
in fact when zach crashes his exwifes wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony,negative
to add insult to injury edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work,negative
for instance vincent gardenias talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender,negative
of all the women in the filmand there are manyalyson reed alone stands out as zachs wife reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role,negative
because we dont care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep the films few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail,negative
the comedy in skin deep doesnt fare much better,negative
most of the jokes are dumb predictable and sitcomish,negative
about every ten minutes however edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sightgag the most effective of which involves a pair of dueling condoms,negative
overall the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat,negative
my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism,negative
zachs excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain,negative
zachs drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences,negative
if he crashes his mercedes he gets a new one,negative
if he gets arrested his lawyer bails him out of jail,negative
if his wife leaves him she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if hell clean up his act,negative
the tone in skin deep is all wrong edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter,negative
perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or better yet michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep,negative
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies,negative
luckily my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta,negative
i knew it was going to be a bad print with only halffaces and poor sound quality but i couldnt help myself,negative
i got it,negative
well after watching it it indeed was a bad print i was glad i didnt dish out 7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie,negative
this movie really sucks,negative
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy,negative
for example how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days,negative
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail,negative
the songs are bad the acting is bad especially deepti bhatnagars and the direction is the worst of all,negative
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up,negative
i didnt even finish the movie,negative
i couldnt take it anymore,negative
note but if anyone out there liked aatish by the same director i guess youd like this movie,negative
its practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff,negative
aditya panscholi is the sidekick again,negative
i was going to give it a zero but i personally like jackie shroff so i loosened up a little,negative
he looked fresh wore good clothes as always and his performance even though it wasnt his best was the only saving grace of the movie,negative
a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle heaven can wait which in turn was a remake of here comes mr jordan down to earth tells the tale of lance barton chris rock lethal weapon iv a young black standup comic trying to win over the audience at harlems apollo theater,negative
when hes taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes eugene levy best in show his only recourse is to return in another body,negative
he chooses that of charles wellington the tenth richest man in the united states,negative
of course wellington is not only rich but white and 53 years old which makes lances bid for closing night at the apollo as well as his desire to woo suntee regina taylor jerry maguire a tad tricky,negative
the original elaine beatty script has been reworked by chris rock lance crouther ali leroi and louis c k,negative
to turn beattys vehicle as a football player into rocks vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor,negative
as directed by chris weitz and paul weitz codirectors of american pie and costars of chuck buck the whole affair comes off as amateur hour,negative
initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals,negative
production values are shoddy,negative
most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate,negative
this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen,negative
rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick such as his turnaround on wellingtons plans for a poor neighborhood hospital bullet in the head,negative
you got a bed but hes uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast,negative
regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis,negative
also good is frankie faison hannibal as whitney lances compassionate manager the only human whos made privy to lances body body switch,negative
chaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heavens ambassadors,negative
another best in show alumnus jennifer coolidge is poorly used as wellingtons cheating wife and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit and greg germann tvs ally mcbeal sweet november continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husbands lawyer,negative
mark addy the full monty is sorely underutilized as cisco wellingtons fake english butler,negative
stealing the show in every scene shes in is wanda sykes the chris rock show as wellingtons disgruntled maid,negative
down to earth is for chris rock fans only,negative
all others should go rent heaven can wait or truly be brought down to earth,negative
well heres a distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually a boxoffice hit at the time of its release,negative
after just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie,negative
it is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was,negative
at least some smut would have livened things up a bit,negative
porkys tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want to get laid,negative
women for the most part are a mystery to them and in this movie they are to the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet,negative
their plan is sidetracked however when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porkys which they are able to get into using fake ids,negative
after they pay the manager onehundred bucks for three hookers they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building,negative
for these four teenage guys this means war on porkys,negative
porkys ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level,negative
as a teenage sexromp it is not wild or amusing enough,negative
as a comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat,negative
as a look back at the 1950s it is something i suspect most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave,negative
and as a revenge movie it is a crushing bore,negative
one of the most offensive things about porkys is how jawdroppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers,negative
the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool,negative
that sure is revealing information,negative
the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark,negative
the women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people,negative
for example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is to be made fun of,negative
mrs balbricker is a gruff noholdsbarred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog,negative
there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though i have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny only humiliating,negative
to prove how outoftouch this socalled comedy is compare it to other more serious 80s films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison,negative
any of the john hughes pictures such as 1984s sixteen candles or 1985s the breakfast club put porkys at an even greater shame,negative
those films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained a great deal funnier thanks to their bright and truthful writing,negative
and heck if porkys wanted to be a teenage sex movie id take 1982s fast times at ridgemont high or 1982s the last american virgin over this any day of the week,negative
director bob clark is not a bad director,negative
two years after he made porkys he directed the nostalgic holiday classic a christmas story,negative
i would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it wasnt for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay,negative
just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in porkys,negative
you know the plot a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be doublecrossed by a fatal femme,negative
in palmetto the dimwit is harry barber woody harrelson a reporter whos just been released from prison he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating,negative
enter la femme rhea malroux elisabeth shue the sexy young wife of the richest man in palmetto florida rolf hoppe,negative
she and her stepdaughter odette chlo sevigny have a plot to extort 500k from the old man harry will kidnap odette,negative
after groping both women harry agrees,negative
as everyone except harry can see hes being set up as a fall guy,negative
sure enough before long harry has a dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail,negative
his brotherinlaw tom wright an assistant da has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case so harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt and we get to watch him sweatliterally,negative
there are several plot twists of coursea couple of them even took me by surprise,negative
apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog and theyre on harry like hes the only bone in the kennel,negative
shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex averys wolf to show up,negative
her incredible performance in leaving las vegas seems to have been a fluke,negative
here she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith,negative
shues character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off as a brainless bimbo,negative
in addition to shue and sevigny the kennel includes gina gershon who filled the dimwitwithashadypast role in bound as harrys girlfriend nina when harry gets out of jail she licks his face now theres a horndog,negative
the parts are so overplayed that with a little push palmetto could have been an overthetop parody of film noir a la romeo is bleeding,negative
as it is its best watched at 2am on showtime the love scenes seem to have been written for one of that channels soft porn programs anyway,negative
palmetto has a wellknown director volker schl ndorff whos best known for his adaptations of major literary works especially the tin drum,negative
i suppose he must have been drawn to this plotbynumbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake cape fear,negative
schl ndorff tries hardhe makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugsbut nothing can freshen up this stale script,negative
you dont look at a ren magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning,negative
you likewise dont look at one for 88 minutes straight,negative
surrealist works are notable for their quirks and they are fun but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting,negative
that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died a surrealistic hyperactive comedy with no dialogue,negative
its not a silent movie there is lots of atmospheric music occasional screams and weird sound effects but nobody ever utters an audible word,negative
though the film is distinctive its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes and as it progressed watching became a chore,negative
the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudolegendary ed wood the man behind such classics as plan 9 from outer space and night of the ghouls,negative
the joke of course is that his films are so bad theyre good so humorous in their inanity that they become hits,negative
i woke up early the day i died unfortunatly is so bad that its really bad,negative
it stars billy zane titanic as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around stealing a car clothes and a load of money,negative
our thief reaches a cemetery where he witnesses a bizarre ritual,negative
he falls asleep and finds himself literally in a hole with his money gone,negative
for whatever reason he is bent on getting his hardunearned cash back considering how easily he stole it the first time why didnt he just go steal some more,negative
he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they dont have what he is looking for,negative
i dont think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short,negative
the subject and the style seem to have been made for it,negative
unfortunately twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome,negative
it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on up to the point where halfway through i was already weary,negative
it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is,negative
i woke up early the day i died is a comedy i guess though it could have fooled me,negative
unlike most ed wood films this one tries to be funny and fails instead of the other way around,negative
theres nothing inherently wrong with that in fact i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so good at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one,negative
whether wood actually went for comedy in his script well never know but in either case this is a failure,negative
jonathan taylor thomas christina ricci summer phoenix john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos,negative
ricci for example plays a prostitute,negative
her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out,negative
thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff,negative
was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work,negative
zane meanwhile occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up,negative
lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature,negative
the carnival sideshow climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this nobudget production,negative
its desperately unfunny but thinks its the funniest thing since plan 9 its so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction,negative
i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting sendoff,negative
1999 eugene novikov 137,negative
not so long ago men by the names of peckinpah ford leone and eastwood made westerns,negative
real westerns,negative
these were some of the best films of the twentieth century,negative
those days are gone,negative
now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western,negative
and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws,negative
outlaws is yet another retelling of the jesse james legend courtesy of bmovie king james g robinson producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor,negative
delayed since the spring this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell the best part of schumachers tigerland as the badass jesse james,negative
alas any sense of his character has been left on the ranch leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter minus the whipped cream to watch,negative
the spin this time around fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war jesse james farrell his brother frank gabriel macht and his pal cole younger scott caan lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended,negative
but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains harris yulin and his cronies rollin parker terry oquinn and allan pinkerton timothy dalton demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads,negative
the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad by robbing banks up and down missouri thus cutting off the railroads financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people,negative
along the way the boys squabble over whos the cutest of the gang whos the most popular cowboy in the gang and who ought to go on mtvs total request live,negative
they rob numerous banks with identical interiors always with the kindest of hearts strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background,negative
the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card,negative
the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell,negative
after a great job in tigerland farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds,negative
and his american accent rivals richard geres irish accent in the jackal,negative
combined with feeling like bonanza the teen years this homogenized production toned down to get the everpopular pg13 rating gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring,negative
the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged sucking out any energy left in the film,negative
not to mention the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws,negative
instead the movie is full of old outrageous tales about the wild west tales which went out of style in 5cent magazines about a century ago,negative
when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy i expect negative reviews from critics left and right,negative
predictable unoriginal and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to yous and the drive me crazys released by the dozens these last couple of years,negative
what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while im sitting in the theater,negative
am i enjoying myself,negative
is this a comfortable break from my week of finals,negative
this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i wont remember next week,negative
so last week i opened up the new york times and no surprise boys and girls got a negative review,negative
daily news,negative
negative,negative
reelviews,negative
negative,negative
epinions com,negative
negative,negative
this was nothing new,negative
american pie final destination road trip didnt get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures,negative
same goes for shes all that a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded,negative
since boys and girls reunites shes all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr i predicted d j vu al over again,negative
but still curious i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it the reactions were far from positive,negative
i had made up my mind ill catch it on video or cable in a couple of years,negative
but soon after following a series of unexpected events we couldnt get into shaft because it is rated r i found myself watching boys and girls,negative
whoops,negative
boys and girls is about a nerdy smart boy named ryan prinze jr and a popular flirt girl named jennifer claire forlani,negative
briefly meeting as preteens and now attending the same college the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends,negative
but in the movies a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other,negative
with advice from their roommates amanda detmer jason biggs ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship,negative
the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found,negative
i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons,negative
the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to,negative
it is almost offensive,negative
an example of an insightful conversation,negative
youre dumb,negative
dumb dumb dumb dumb,negative
no,negative
followed by a mandy mooreesque tune background,negative
well its not as bad as wing commander i guess,negative
the supporting cast is also painfully useless,negative
detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring pointless subplots,negative
and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex prinze jrs ryan dominates the screen while forlanis jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with,negative
we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character,negative
teenager or not youll hate this movie i guarantee it,negative
maybe i should rent shes all that again,negative
is it really as good as i think it is,negative
guilt guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time the penultimate t a thriller basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living,negative
but i know so well that its a terrible film made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt,negative
verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and on november seventh 1997 unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies,negative
the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year,negative
a simple white on black title card reads starship troopers my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped verhoeven realized he forgot the credits,negative
is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open,negative
were the rest of the film that subdued,negative
starship troopers is about a group of white blondhaired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names,negative
they graduate high school join the military and then rather curiously decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet,negative
the story is so incomprehensible and told so bombastically its akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue,negative
aside club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasnt changed in the future,negative
one plus starship troopers contains some very funny sequences specifically the newsreels of the future,negative
hysterically funny actually,negative
but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between,negative
the storytelling lacks focus to say the least,negative
the politics of the film are scary,negative
the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their outofcontrol libidos,negative
theres even a creepy sex scene the lovely dina meyer makes out nude with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater just the way he seems to like it,negative
i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor ive encountered in a big budget picture all chiseled features and machismo he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders,negative
of course verhoevens probably the one to blame and perhaps im jealous because im so disgusting,negative
at any rate a movie called starship troopers shouldnt be about sex,negative
exactly ten years ago verhoeven made robocop which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving,negative
and rrated despite its goofy premise,negative
maybe its asking too much for verhoeven to make a pgmovie thenhes a master of insipid violence,negative
however ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it,negative
a backdrop of new years eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie,negative
the decor possibilities are endless disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic big hair was worth its weight in aquanet and the louder the fashion the better the look,negative
but despite this setting these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade something is inherently wrong with 200 cigarettes,negative
a better title for this nostalgic mess would be 50 missed opportunities,negative
what is it that makes this retrocomedy such a downer,negative
its certainly not the cast which includes enough hot young talent for several movies,negative
theres courtney love cementing her reputation as a serious actress christina ricci hot off her shouldabeennominated turn in the opposite of sex paul rudd who gets even more appealing with every role kate hudson inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn and affleck brothers ben and casey two of the best things about good will hunting,negative
perhaps the question is this what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project,negative
maybe it looked good on paper,negative
200 cigarettes is composed of a series of vignettes as various characters make their way through new yorks festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica martha plimpton all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper,negative
among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin rudd and his best friend lucy love busy bickering over his recent breakup and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ben affleck who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pickup lines,negative
more subplots many more dot the big picture but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light,negative
all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubicks cube,negative
ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants out to have a high time in the big city,negative
infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a severalscene cameo,negative
hudson as a prettyinpink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies man jay mohr trips pukes and gets smeared with dog poop,negative
are we laughing yet,negative
the film boils down to a mixture of the good the bad and the gaudy with the latter two overtaking the former,negative
game performances especially by love rudd and plimpton are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle,negative
too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other,negative
if this is 200 cigarettes then get me 200 nicotine patches,negative
i have no real tangible proof of this but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director then it is actually possible to make a good movie,negative
using their logic all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of superfamous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget,negative
this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre,negative
now before i continue to ferociously attack whats wrong with this film i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller,negative
catherine zetajones plays virginia baker an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal sean connery,negative
if youve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before i really dont have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details the two team up for various jobs stealing various things for various purposes,negative
the problem we come to is that weve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesnt break any new ground in the big action genre,negative
the result is that the entire production feels contrived,negative
im going to be completely honest here pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the runtime was looking at catherine zetajones,negative
now while this may be a compliment for ms zetajones it certainly isnt for either the writers or the director who are not nearly as clever as they think they are,negative
just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between entrapment and blackmail,negative
with an eighty million dollar budget youd think that entrapment would at least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes or breathtaking special,negative
well youd be wrong,negative
the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular,negative
unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by 11 years,negative
the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture you know exactly whats going to happen despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists,negative
many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zetajones in extremely tightfitting clothing,negative
one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laserbeams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask,negative
nothing wrong with that but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was so why didnt she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room,negative
ill tell you why because its a great excuse to photograph zetajones posterior as it slides underneath those beams and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing the rehearsal,negative
ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie and though he has great screen presence although so do connery and zetajones and the most interesting character in the film not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss a concept i invented just to describe this picture,negative
one last complaint entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot hell spontaneously disappear in ninjalike fashion,negative
i can picture amiel patting himself on the back thinking to himself itll leave the audience wondering for days how did he do that,negative
we know jon its called editing,negative
john carpenter makes bmovies,negative
always has halloween escape from new york the thing and by the looks of it they live escape from l a vampires always will,negative
carpenters latest horror opus with a science fiction bent or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent is the aptlytitled john carpenters ghosts of mars in case i suppose you went looking for someone elses ghosts of mars,negative
like all those films prefixed by the very possessive john carpenters ghosts of mars is an unashamed bmovie punctuated by a bmovie plot bmovie actors and bmovie special effects,negative
in category one above we have a storyline that borders on idiotic and at times chaotic,negative
dormant martians i e swirling red gases awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes,negative
all this explained in flashback to some grand poohbah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard natasha henstridge from the sub species films the only returnee on a sillylooking train,negative
officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james desolation williams what she found was not a pretty picture,negative
in the second category we have ms henstridge her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail ice cube as the appropriatelynamed desolation pam grier briefly oddlywho wanted to work with whom i wonder and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didnt need to try too hard,negative
in category number three we have in addition to those swirling red gases and the sillylooking train a couple of birdseyeview shots of a sprawling martian metropolis reddish also,negative
stateoftheart special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the who seems to have no problem finding work however doesnt waste any of the films budget in that department,negative
ghosts of mars is lock laughing stock and barrel all your standard carpenter fare dingy interiors cluttered exteriors inane dialogue lots of leather scarred crazedlooking aliens and lots and lots of weaponry,negative
the film often and always explodes into warfare without warningspontaneously stupidly,negative
carpenter might like to think hes made a western here but its a western without any real heroes villains or border conflicts,negative
its just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken,negative
i never thought id miss the guy but i do,negative
its not all the same however,negative
dubbed the onenote wonder for his minimalist music soundtracks carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic yet effective scoring by highlighting his action with loud screeching guitar work,negative
fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue,negative
the final exchange between henstridge and er cube though is both audible and priceless,negative
mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so what with the stillborn mission to mars and red planet with val kilmer,negative
ghosts of mars sadly adds to those disappointing returns in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels among them american pie 2 and rush hour 2,negative
the irony is that the mars in carpenters film feels sadly absent,negative
there are occasional references to the red planet of course but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earths closest neighbor,negative
two things keep john carpenters ghosts of mars from getting a huge slap upside the head,negative
1,negative
henstridge keeps her top on miraculously and 2 the film doesnt pretend to be anything its not,negative
what that means however is that fans of superior intelligent grade a sci are singularly out of luck,negative
silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at the last stop cafe and motel due to heavy snowfall,negative
one of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman adam beach who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery,negative
someone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals,negative
adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film,negative
he doesnt play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny,negative
his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other,negative
rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always and jurgen prochnow,negative
what on earth is he doing in this,negative
best performance comes from william s taylor as a cheesy yet still somehow cool and confident wayne newton drifter type,negative
the last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment,negative
as usual with sterling theyve filled out this dvd with extra features,negative
the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 85 1 a choice of 2 0 dolby surround sound or 5 1 dolby digital surround sound a full length audio commentary track with director mark malone interviews with the cast and crew the original trailer and the usual cast and crew biographies,negative
the film itself might not be the greatest but sterlings effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable suggested retail of 19 95 makes this dvd worth the money,negative
r,negative
you would think that this films dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and americanizing it,negative
youd be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis,negative
should you ever happen to meet those chaps do me a favor,negative
grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear what were you thinking,negative
have you ever heard the phrase if it aint broke dont fix it,negative
then walk away,negative
the film concerns mr bean atkinson and his visit to america while escorting the painting of whistlers mother to an american buyer played by burt reynolds in the type of bit part that his success in boogie nights should hopefully do away with,negative
now how or why mr bean is sent on this trip makes no sense and i cant even describe how the film explains it,negative
the point is that mr bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble,negative
problems problems problems where to begin,negative
first the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from beetlejuice or one note away from the score from rob roy,negative
then the song choices are totally uninspired,negative
good vibrations,negative
i love l a,negative
wow dont put any thought into that guys,negative
also bean makes way too much noise in the film,negative
the character doesnt speak much but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience and maybe the occasional murmur from mr bean,negative
each episode was like a chaplin silent movie,negative
in the film bean is constantly moaning grunting whining etc its annoying and just plain wrong for the character,negative
the main problem though is that its just not funny,negative
with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes,negative
multiply that running time by three however and the laughs steadily decrease,negative
they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series,negative
sad and creatively lazy,negative
as a series mr bean only ran for about 13 episodes or so,negative
why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything,negative
13 halfhour episodes certainly hadnt exhausted all possible situations,negative
all i can say positively for the film at this point is that its almost appropriate for all ages if it wasnt for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr bean is having sex with things,negative
and even that isnt a very positive statement,negative
please guys go back to england and go back to television so youll make me laugh again,negative
pg13,negative
remember tom cruise and brian brown as rival bartenders juggling bottles of booze in cocktail,negative
remember how stupid that looked,negative
and remember the scantilyclad dancers of flashdance getting doused with buckets of water,negative
well coyote ugly does those films five better or six better if you count john goodman since here we have piper perado maria bello tyra banks melanie lynskey and izabella miko doing the absolut spinning and jiggling thing while pouring pitchers of perrier all over their seminaked torsos,negative
no goodman doesnt flip jim beams or wear anything particularly risqu in the film but he does get up on the bar and start gyrating with the rest of them,negative
and the central characters love interest played by an australian actor named adam garcia proves he can get up on that bar and start shimmying along with the rest of them too,negative
what seems to have started life as a victorias secret photo shoot quickly deteriorates into one heck of an embarrassing movie,negative
violet perado is a south amboy hopeful who tries to make it big as a songwriter not a welder in new jack city,negative
as na ve as they come shes fobbed off by music producers receptionists by the scornful and has her apartment robbed hours after touching down in chinatown,negative
and like her mother before her she gets stage fright whenever she tries to do the open mike night thing,negative
when she sees a trio of babealicious barkeeps thumbing through a stack of 20s in an allnight diner violet simply has to check out this bar they call coyote ugly,negative
lil bello the nononsense owner agrees to give violet an audition but violet blows it,negative
still lil gives violet another chance,negative
a riot breaks out riots are the order of the day at uglys since the staff are relentless in flaunting their sexual wares flambeeing the bar and soaking the patrons with diet spritethis is certifiable behavior in case i didnt mention it but violet successfully subdues the crowd by singing along to blondies one way or another on the jukebox,negative
shes hired,negative
and cured since this little episode gives her the confidence to sing in an amateur talent contest where her dad goodman the junk foodeating laundryimpaired toll collector comes to see her and is as proud as punch,negative
the end,negative
okay bear with me yall cause first off i have to get this off my chest,negative
what the hell is up with that damn crab,negative
whew okay,negative
cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end as cute as the crab maybe,negative
even i know that you need more footage than that,negative
and that wasnt the only thing getting on my nerves,negative
the cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar as amanda and sean patrick flannery as tom might have held some appeal during oh say the first 10 minutes of the movie,negative
at first the movie moves along at a quick interesting pace,negative
it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just doesnt die,negative
a ridiculous concept yes but at this point im willing to accept it because im willing to accept that this is how amandas life is changed how her powers are received,negative
later on the movie cant seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom,negative
and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying they werent just repetitive they were out of place and unnecessary,negative
the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development amanda suddenly becoming a great chef her falling in love with tom etc sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good,negative
some places the plot just doesnt make sense sometimes its way too contrived the crab bit for example and sometimes too corny peaches emitting dry ice,negative
cant beat that,negative
all in all the plot seemed fragmented unconnected,negative
not romantic at all and only funny in some places,negative
so okay do the magic powers come from the crab,negative
or the fairy godfather,negative
she can float now too,negative
and all of a sudden instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches she can put her emotions into her food,negative
tom all of a sudden just accepts amandas witchcraft in the end,negative
would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupacs video,negative
what the hell is up with that damn crab,negative
it is unfortunate because i liked the basic premise of the movie until it became too fantastical and tiresome,negative
the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least a theme for a while but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables,negative
the humor was good in some places nolan gets the funniest bits including that incomprehensible totally random thing with the dolls,negative
gellar and flannery are qualified actors and gellar has a particular charm but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy or even annette in the upcoming cruel intentions than this sorry excuse for a character,negative
its almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible,negative
the supporting character nolan was a highlight though he reminded me a bit of kevin in youve got mail see footnotes,negative
and as always typical of a chick flick romantic comedy theres a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background cued up at all the right places,negative
this sort of got on the nerves after a while too,negative
simply irresistible is not hard to understand light funny in some places and generally disappointing because it cant draw the line between romance and protracted sap between humor and tired slapstick,negative
and how could i refrain from making a pun,negative
simply irresistible is all too easy to resist,negative
first viewing 2699,negative
did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to youve got mail or the shop around the corner,negative
business rivals fall in love,negative
female counterparts business is in danger of being shut down,negative
female as mother like figure guiding her,negative
the annoying hysterical exgirlfriends,negative
i really like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe,negative
capsule in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace,negative
there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise,negative
john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct 13 that the new film comes off as his homage to himself,negative
0 4 to 4,negative
john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes,negative
for a writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is a very bad mistake to make,negative
ghosts of mars is called a horror movie but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly lowpowered alien menace,negative
in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds to sue,negative
this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 the thing and prince of darkness,negative
it is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way,negative
but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience,negative
ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176,negative
mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the films budget,negative
it is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earthnormal again making it easier to film,negative
society has changed a bit by that time but it has advanced surprisingly little,negative
apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control,negative
and from carpenters view women have really made a mess of things,negative
society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten,negative
the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 yes precinct 9 has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony,negative
instead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film has the criminal desolation williams,negative
instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars,negative
because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination,negative
the story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback,negative
ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red yellow and black,negative
carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat,negative
sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup,negative
the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss,negative
his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring,negative
these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience,negative
somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights,negative
within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars red planet and ghosts of mars,negative
after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by,negative
i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale,negative
following the movie i showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did carpenters classic assault on precinct 13,negative
her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice,negative
retrospective city of the living dead 1980,negative
a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson,negative
i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as dimwitted,negative
and by golly just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead,negative
although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career this is not one of them,negative
two points in the movies favour the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi keep things from falling totally into the abyss but by and large city of the living dead is a failure,negative
and like most cinematic failures it comes down to bad writing dumb performances and lousy direction,negative
the story starts in new york when during a seance a medium katherine mccoll sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich massachusetts,negative
for reasons we wont go into here this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth,negative
the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist christopher george,negative
that scene in itself is a howler why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside,negative
and dont cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before theyre buried,negative
anyway off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world where various grisly goingson are already happening as all saints day approaches,negative
fulcis graphic gore is in evidence once again but here it only serves to further highlight the films flimsy script and plodding direction,negative
the dialogue in all manner of speaking is unspeakable,negative
not bad in the quotable sense like an ed wood film but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious lets explain the plot type approach,negative
mccoll doesnt have a clue who her character is deadly serious one minute frivolous the next she at times is genuinely hard to watch,negative
and the geezer the actors name escapes me who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses,negative
christopher georges performance is salvageable but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we dont care,negative
in fact we dont care for anyone in city of the living dead though in other fulci films that hasnt mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man as he was in the beyond,negative
as a director some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here,negative
he constantly uses extreme closeups of peoples eyes a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors arent capable of,negative
and despite some gruesome violence he barely manages a single scare in the entire film,negative
longtime collaborator fabio frizzi talented but always erratic offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electropop thats quite frankly embarrassing,negative
fulcis other films of this period may be flawed house by the cemetery the beyond the black cat but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey,negative
for completists only,negative
salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets,negative
actors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation,negative
proof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies and one fine example is breakaway 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding,negative
face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster,negative
one day she decides to retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that,negative
realising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed by professional assassins,negative
terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater,negative
although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much to be desired,negative
on the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms a bad name,negative
martin sheens brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway,negative
unfortunately he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved to be her last film,negative
some movies i should just skip,negative
my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back and here comes another disney effectsfilled liveaction flick based on an old tv program,negative
true the probgram is only 15 years old this time and its a cartoon,negative
but its a cartoon i liked and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen,negative
but my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be,negative
turns out i was right mostly,negative
inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jivetalking sidekick,negative
at first i thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver,negative
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isnt just business its a way of life,negative
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits,negative
in some parts you can just hear them saying more zany,negative
i want more zany here and here,negative
lets have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful,negative
i want the audience squirming in their seats,negative
ok thats fine but i want you to add bug guts,negative
what does this scene do,negative
character depth,negative
but wheres the zaniness,negative
i dont see zany here,negative
if you cant make it zany cut it,negative
the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie,negative
michelle who plays penny gadgets niece shines in every scene shes in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time,negative
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor,negative
dabney colemans comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby,negative
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes,negative
he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor,negative
oteris overly enthusiastic and continually selfcongratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregons own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasnt poking fun at our fair town,negative
or maybe all career politicians are like that,negative
i must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla,negative
he appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget,negative
rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw,negative
joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself,negative
her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film,negative
d l hughley plays the shuckinandjivin vehicular sidekick in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years,negative
the dialog is lets face it its pretty bad,negative
the tagline after a major setpiece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context,negative
a lot of the lines especially hughleys appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for adlib,negative
about threequarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw,negative
gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget,negative
penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon,negative
let me rage here just for a minute,negative
michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character,negative
shes utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pintsize detective,negative
why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery,negative
the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity,negative
inspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but its a very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment,negative
probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits,negative
the evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds its onscreen,negative
all in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films,negative
i wonder if disney uses the revenues for its generally moneymaking cartoons to produce these losers,negative
but if true why,negative
if theyre trying for another mary poppins they need to find a team that can produce one and then give them a chance to do it,negative
the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole,negative
and in the future its also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole,negative
naturally this is the setup for the other event horizon,negative
the movie,negative
when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at just outside of neptune the crew of the ship called the lewis and clark has to go to investigate and dr william weir the creator of the event horizon gets to come along for the ride,negative
if youve glanced at a poster for this movie you know that supposedly what follows is infinite terror,negative
well i dont know about the terror part but infinite certainly seems to qualify,negative
event horizon is a meanspirited gory sick excuse for a film,negative
it starts off as an alien ripoff and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes,negative
at least for those first 40 minutes its an interesting ripoff of alien,negative
thats a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie which seems to go on forever,negative
it not a scary monster movie nor is it a psychological thriller,negative
it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore,negative
youve seen this kind of movie before,negative
the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility,negative
this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago,negative
it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore but event horizon takes the low road and the viewers pay the price,negative
there are many good respectable performances from fishburne and neill most noticably,negative
paul andersons direction is impressive as it was in mortal kombat,negative
there are many nice special effects mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zerogravity,negative
the sets are beautiful to gaze upon,negative
and richard t jones character cooper is hilarious and extremely likable more so than most characters ive seen in recent movies for the little screen time that he has,negative
and none of this can save the movie from being a dgrade level of film,negative
the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers is a promising one,negative
a haunted house story in space isnt such a bad idea,negative
but the final execution is extremely disappointing,negative
thats not to say that philip eisner here making his feature filmwriting debut doesnt have talent,negative
for those first 40 minutes he manages to make a tired premise interesting adding in aspects of unique flavor into a ripoff story and thats something that not too many writers can do,negative
he even has one scene that though it also tries to sicken the audience has a honestly tense feel to it the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space,negative
he definitely has something of a gift but its not fully on display here,negative
i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise,negative
but because of what this movie degenerates into i have little or no respect and got little or no enjoyment out of it,negative
if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film then i agree with laurence fishburnes sentiment god help us,negative
its a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it,negative
such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film the last samurai,negative
though the blurb alludes to a jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic a middleaged japanese businessman named endo played by john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel to africa in search of his ancestor who went to bring buddhism to africa,negative
he hires the services of downattheheels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels to the camp of an armsmerchantcumsafarihost cumislamicmissionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher,negative
they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witchdoctor aspirations to conceal a prearranged arms deal which subsequently falls through,negative
congo escapes finds endos ancestors sword and comes back guns blazing to free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword,negative
the end,negative
the last samurai is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable,negative
it is merely there,negative
the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all,negative
the film is shot through with all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie,negative
it is quite slowpaced with only a bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic,negative
most of the acting is fair with the possible exception of congos girlfriend,negative
lance henriksen is his usual scenechewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie,negative
the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery,negative
i paid 3 for this film from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect i overpaid for it,negative
if you are in the mood for samurai read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie,negative
skip the last samurai unless you are a diehard henriksen fan,negative
director luis mandokis last film was the superb serious 1994 drama when a man loves a woman but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture message in a bottle which is the worst type of romance a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up,negative
everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso theres an absence of suspense and the film ultimately moves at such a very very deliberate pace as if it is trying to make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through,negative
message in a bottle begins with theresa osborne robin wright penn a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day,negative
inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and to her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper,negative
soon a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks a boating town in north carolina to find out the specifics of the message,negative
of course garrett turns out to be a handsome rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner,negative
she is immediately charmed by him but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died a few years earlier,negative
do you think you know where this is headed,negative
most likely you do and i wouldnt call it giving away anything to say that by the pictures end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that i didnt buy for a second,negative
if there are any positive things to say about message in a bottle it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman as garretts stubborn but loving father are far above par to be in such a wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city,negative
meanwhile costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently,negative
it seems that with such bad luck he wouldnt want to make another movie set near water but here he is again with one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on a stormswept sea,negative
the other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the friend roles here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune,negative
the first half of message in a bottle plays like a humdrum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends a great deal of time getting to know garrett with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining,negative
usually i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking,negative
when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble,negative
i swear that while watching message in a bottle i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality im not even familiar to the novel this is based on by nicholas sparks,negative
always one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing,negative
nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after,negative
this same exact problem occurred in last years very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar i mean meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama city of angels,negative
although theresa is deeply touched by the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own preferably before filming began,negative
it should have read memo to screenwriters use you brain,negative
once upon a time jeanclaude van damme was a decent action hero,negative
the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films boasting his spectacular martialarts ability,negative
some of these excursions were fun,negative
but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mindnumbing action,negative
and when the action goes sour what is there left to enjoy,negative
ill explain,negative
knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong,negative
marcus ray van damme a babemagnet and stylish dresser heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner rob schneider,negative
they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans seemingly by a mole in the business,negative
im going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph so if you want a review devoid of spoilers skip onto the next one,negative
im not quite sure who gives a crap but ill issue a warning anyhow,negative
tommy is really working with the cia,negative
his boss a very hammy and flat paul sorvino is the mole and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons,negative
he even stoops so low to put them into childrens toys,negative
if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing then you probably will enjoy knock off,negative
if you think that this ridiculous setup couldnt even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing this might not be your cup of tea,negative
knock off sucks,negative
it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares,negative
it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something simply because van damme is the star,negative
the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe,negative
director tsui hark who teamed with van damme in the superior but still lamebrained double team is at the helm and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot,negative
i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous,negative
the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence speeds are altered consistently and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired,negative
it all sounds very cool,negative
trust me it isnt,negative
as much as it scars me to say this har har van damme is terrible,negative
sure he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease,negative
he looks like hes doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan and his performance is stiff and tired,negative
i hate to say it but perhaps its time for mr van damme to give up his day job,negative
its really a test of endurance watching knock off,negative
i suppose theres some enjoyment derived from schneiders character who is extremely annoying but provides the films better moments,negative
and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie,negative
hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter,negative
knock off doesnt even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film like a handful of van dammes others,negative
no this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking,negative
and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department that is certainly not saying much,negative
note to self avoid universal soldier 2 the return upon release in august 99,negative
exuniversal soldier luc has to battle a group of newermodel engineered fighters gone bad,negative
the review,negative
jeanclaude van damme has a oneliner early on in universal soldier the return his latest attempt to remain relevant that sums up this entire movie he says been there done that,negative
no film critic could possibly sum up van dammes recent film choices any better,negative
while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him martial arts and guns,negative
this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex,negative
he joins fellow martial star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away,negative
universal soldier the return is truly poor,negative
the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade specifically terminator 2 judgement day and the similarly named soldier,negative
soldiers kurt russell was an older model supersoldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors for the good of a planet schwarzeneggers terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine the t1000 and jeanclaude a former universal soldier has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of you guessed it newer model soldiers,negative
considering the poor box office performance of soldier its amazing that this project was ever given the goahead,negative
luc devereaux van damme was the sole remaining universal soldier or unisol for short until he was returned to a normal if muscular human form,negative
in this sequel technically the fourth film in the series following two straighttovideo duds that were ignored here plotwise luc is now a human of sorts for the unisol program,negative
working with dylan cotner xander berkeley who interestingly also appeared in t2 the unisol program has engineered a tougher fiercer fighting force with the help of supercomputer seth,negative
unfortunately upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government seth takes control of his soldiers killing everyone in the building except for luc his partner maggie his daughter hillary and erin a reporter trapped inside,negative
the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive while beating up a group of nearindestructible soldiers most notably romeo popular wrestler goldberg,negative
there are lots of fights gun battles lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility,negative
there are so many clich s in this film that it is almost painful to watch,negative
luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on and in the course of a single night they go from bickering to falling for each other to kissing,negative
erin is a patheticallywritten character people are getting brutally gunned down all around her and yet not only does this not seem to frighten her but she finds time to remind luc that she isnt leaving without her story,negative
whatever,negative
other laughable moments include a luc going to a strip club to get internet access what and b a group of rangers who after having been given good advice luc tells them that their weapons are useless and shows them a specific gun which should work better choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway guess who wins the battle,negative
not one single scene in universal soldier the return has any originality to it,negative
when fuelled by don davis loud driving music score the films many fights become almost passable but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves,negative
director mic rodgers a former stunt coordinator keeps the action coming at a rapid pace with only a few token serious moments to be found,negative
his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion,negative
if only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li rodgers could probably have made a decent action film,negative
to place the blame squarely at van dammes feet however is an injustice,negative
im not sure that anyone not even robert deniro or edward norton could make writers william malone and john fasanos script sound good,negative
one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access,negative
he cringes looks down and mutters uh uhm,negative
they all do i saw it on 60 minutes,negative
eh he he he the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg,negative
he chews up every scene he is in obviously enjoying his role immensely,negative
he even gives the film a few laughs as he mutters things like i really dont like that guy every time he fails to kill luc,negative
sadly his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo,negative
first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating its been given,negative
for those of us who havent read the james lee burke novel that heavens prisoners is based on do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps gangsters with louisiana accents plots subplots more plots and well really just want to see teri hatcher naked this is one movie youre going to worry the price of admission over,negative
hopeful still,negative
well let me share my moment of sheer panic and then the cold enervation of the big letdown when a semirobed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin what do you think of my butterfly,negative
butterfly,negative
i asked myself what butterfly,negative
and then it hit me,negative
the scene had been snipped,negative
damn you godless pg rating show us her butterfly,negative
we want to see the goddamn butterfly,negative
so,negative
no naked teri hatcher,negative
forget about that,negative
okay,negative
now,negative
heavens prisoners is about exalchoholic excop dave robicheaux alec baldwin whos trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving downtoearth wife annie kelly lynch,negative
everything dull but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while theyre on their boat,negative
the plane nosedives into the water and sinks but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixiefaced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt,negative
what they dont realise is that the planes pilot was also a drug dealer and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latters erstwhile colleagues,negative
when robicheaux discovers this he predictably against the advice of his wife a wellmeaning dea agent and two gangsters who rough him up begins poking his nose where it dont belong we know that the man deserves all the misery hes going to get,negative
the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide,negative
as dave robicheaux alec baldwin is fat,negative
no seriously this is not the svelte thinking mans hero of the hunt for red october it is an outofshape guy who doesnt look too good in a rooftop chasing scene,negative
hes also unconvincing in the movies dramatic moments acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segallike economy of expression,negative
threequarters of the way through the show while youre probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up youll want to beat on him a little yourself,negative
on the other hand mary stuart masterson some kind of wonderful fried green tomatoes benny joon cast as a downandout stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air with just the right mix of cynicism warmth insecurity and humour to be the movies only endearing character,negative
eric roberts as bubba rocque always believable as the womanabusing bad guy who knows how to box see final analysis coincidentally also directed by phil joanou is believable here as the womanabusing bad guy who knows how to box,negative
and lest we forget teri hatchers role in all this this being her rather wellpublicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tvs adventures of lois clark,negative
she is totally ridiculous as rocques manipulative and seductive cajun wife coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair whos trying to get back at an employer who hasnt been giving her enough days off,negative
its probably safe to say that her day job beckons,negative
and at the end of our day none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery,negative
the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
its been hours since i returned from the much anticipated scifi opus mission to mars and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar,negative
why,negative
the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera instead shooting for the angle of a feelgood science fiction drama more akin to 2001 a space odyssey,negative
i got the feeling that most of my fellow moviegoing patrons were expecting another armageddon,negative
but no mission to mars certainly isnt one large action sequence about colossal disaster,negative
this is a supposedly thoughtful familyfriendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel,negative
you have been warned,negative
of course crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible see apollo 13 for an excellent example but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation,negative
brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off,negative
when he gets his hands on an intelligent systematically practical script like the untouchables or mission impossible the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally,negative
of course theres also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name including snake eyes and the notorious bomb the bonfire of the vanities,negative
all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood,negative
that term may be too harsh but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission to mars my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient,negative
if i were gary sinise i wouldnt touch de palma with a 10foot pole,negative
sinise is a wonderful wonderful actor but after appearing in snake eyes and this vomitinducing sham im sure he wouldnt want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration,negative
the academy awardwinner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell a man who recently lost his wife kim delaney and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars oops forgot to mention the year 2020,negative
after a barbecue gettogether for the astronauts we cut to luc goddard don cheadle and his team who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet,negative
suddenly a towering formation of rocks and soil probably best dubbed a sand tornado appears and creates a whirlwind of suction,negative
for some reason the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this as if it were a lovely piece of art,negative
the team is killed within seconds expect for luc who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive,negative
immediately a second mission consisting of astronauts mcconnell husband and wife woody and terri blake tim robbins and connie nielsen and phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars,negative
lets put the secret on hold for now and discuss the trip there,negative
it is explained whether scientifically accurate or not probably not that a trip to mars takes roughly six months,negative
im not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind m2m didnt capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia,negative
instead we join the team during their final days aboard the ship,negative
what happened during the five months prior to this,negative
did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes,negative
still there are few nicely tense moments maybe the only in the movie during the timeframe involving a fuel leak,negative
depalmas direction is quite good in these scenes although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent organ music in space,negative
cmon,negative
theres a few good imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud,negative
its a colossal bummer that mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists,negative
as mentioned before anyone looking for some disastermovie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed,negative
maybe even cheated,negative
after the unbelievably hokey final shot with the words the end somehow adding insult to injury a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen,negative
others muttered obscenities shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling jeez that sucked,negative
okay it did suck,negative
but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy,negative
after all they do pretty well,negative
sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple and funnyman oconnell well he has a couple lines are actually amusing and intentionally so,negative
the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive,negative
so by golly where did this mission go wrong,negative
looking back on the appalling experience i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have,negative
while watching mission to mars my suggestion would be to immediately abort or better yet dont even strap yourself in for liftoff,negative
disconnect the phone line,negative
dont accept the charges,negative
do anything you can to avoid the wretched melodramatic sisterhood dramedy hanging up,negative
i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side and hanging up seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so,negative
the film features an incredible palate of female talent and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as sleepless in seattle and unsung heroes,negative
meg ryan diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who once separated by career judgments over family ties must reunite when their father walter matthau is admitted into the hospital with alzheimers disease,negative
while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery,negative
hanging up has the overall effect of a telemarketer pestering you for two hours while you dont have the option of doing as the title suggests,negative
for the first halfhour the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development,negative
this is an annoying and ineffective device,negative
cellphones ring every five minutes and everyone hurriedly rushes along leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters issues and problems,negative
if hanging up was an apple pie then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story,negative
granted there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film,negative
but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck,negative
the most outrageous strategy in hanging up is that after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale,negative
we are able to identify with eve ryan the most open and caring daughter because she is the one who stayed by her fathers side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career,negative
georgia keaton the eldest daughter is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called,negative
georgia,negative
maddy kudrow the soap opera actress spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog,negative
ryans convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of hanging up,negative
kudrow so delightfully eccentric as the offkilter airhead phoebe in friends is totally wasted,negative
ditto for keaton who is serving a double shift as costar and director a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle,negative
her frenzy is apparent,negative
for a chick flick there is a distressing lack of chuckles,negative
the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that given his characters situation seems more depressing than amusing,negative
even so the peak form of humor in hanging up is represented by some of matthaus nasty quips and ryans eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill,negative
that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film,negative
my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and starstudded approach could turn so viciously sour,negative
but really its no mystery,negative
the predictable melodramatic filth that is hanging up is certainly not the fault of these actresses,negative
pin it on the screenplay which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations,negative
its certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience but hanging up should have at least been enjoyable,negative
uhuh,negative
its a wrong number from the beginning,negative
well what are you going to expect,negative
its a movie about a big snake that eats people,negative
thats what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more,negative
instead i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me too,negative
anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river,negative
led by anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives,negative
along the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda,negative
to simply say that this is the worlds largest snake wouldnt be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide,negative
if this isnt a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers i dont know what is,negative
at the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems to be more or less over now,negative
i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being a setup for nothing,negative
cale chokes on a deadly wasp dont ask me how that happens i dont know and is put out of action relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help,negative
this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarones plan to capture the snake,negative
however this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle,negative
most bad characters are either annoying or stupid,negative
in this movie theyre both,negative
since this description applies to all the characters except sarone its hard to find someone to root for,negative
youre supposed to back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because hes smarter than everyone else,negative
or maybe hes just not as dumb as everyone else,negative
at times i almost found myself rooting for the snake,negative
there are no standout performances here,negative
everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters,negative
even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason,negative
no matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway,negative
in most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real,negative
however the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences,negative
sometimes for example the snake just moves too fast,negative
it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall for crying out loud,negative
then theres another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snakes skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victims pained expression from within the snakes belly,negative
absolutely ridiculous,negative
a testimony to the films bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is,negative
in a scene totally unrelated to anything else we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther,negative
the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panthers eyeballs pops out,negative
eeeewwwww,negative
above and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed,negative
in films like these a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained,negative
if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them,negative
to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters dont know about and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown,negative
in a case like that the showdown just ends up being a letdown,negative
when i saw the snake for the first time i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasnt the real danger,negative
this one was just a decoy and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe,negative
no such luck,negative
okay maybe anaconda is actually a decoy and theres really a better movie waiting to make its debut,negative
another formula feel good quirky comedy from the british isles much like waking ned devine and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line,negative
it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin,negative
the strength of this film lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol,negative
the film is tolerable until after its first hour it then falls completely apart becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas,negative
but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to at least be viewed as containing a pertinent message,negative
its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about to be escalated into colombia,negative
the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future it has so far just ended up causing americas jails to be overcrowded with nonviolent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing americas drug usage and drug supply,negative
billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war by backing a corrupt government remember vietnam with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country,negative
everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam with this scenario closer to home so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war,negative
the films mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago is a theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that is better received late than never,negative
there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this rather than making it a police matter altogether,negative
the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middleaged woman grace brenda blethyn who fell out of an airplane evidently committing suicide,negative
the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined,negative
he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up without her knowledge their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage,negative
the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husbands enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless,negative
she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london honey quick,negative
what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying is that when conferring with honey she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her,negative
even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can the creditors swoop down on her like vultures,negative
her gardener and handyman matthew ferguson decides to stay on with her despite his last check bouncing,negative
since she is an expert amateur horticulturist he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants which he grows for private use,negative
the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be highquality stuff,negative
for grace this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt for the scotsman matthew it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky valerie,negative
the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed the police sergeant campbell pretends not to notice what the bright lights in graces greenhouse is for the friendly vicar phillips counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you cant control and the doctor clunes enjoys smoking the weed for recreation,negative
the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a bigtime drug dealer instead of having matthew go because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesnt want matthew to end up in jail,negative
it is interesting to note that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you only that one can go to jail,negative
the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london trying to find a drug dealer while dressed out of place in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole whereby it never recovered its dignity,negative
the film moves into the formula mode whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive as she meets an international drug dealer a frenchman tcheky karyo who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences thereby becoming a celebrity,negative
things work out in a ridiculous way where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood,negative
there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded,negative
this unhip film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly but should be tolerated as something naughty middleaged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute,negative
ummm,negative
there will be another the ads for this sequel proclaimed and why not,negative
true brandon lee is dead but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994s the crow anyway,negative
the idea of spinning artist james obarrs original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie taking its own righteous vengeance against the world,negative
given that basic framework the story could move in any number of directions,negative
of course it doesnt,negative
stubbornly the crow city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film when lees eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death,negative
i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality,negative
in flashback we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover and then we watch in realtime as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind,negative
its loud and repetitive true a sadists delight but its also horrifying and fascinating,negative
city of angels gives us more of the same but less skillfully,negative
theres an audience guaranteed for a film like this although bad reviews and poor wordofmouth will likely ensure that it wont be much of a success,negative
in fact miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings,negative
ive never understood the reasoning behind this tactic since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow,negative
so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup,negative
this time ashe frenchaccented actor vincent perez is retrieved from his watery death he and his young son were shackled together shot and then thrown off a pier by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead,negative
perez might have some screen presence if hes given something to do with himself but here hes simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face,negative
at first hes shivery and frightened but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave,negative
hes befriended by sarah mia kirshner presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film,negative
kirshner so beguiling in exotica is here an exquisitely photographed blank,negative
tattooed with angels wings sarah is just about as lovely as women come but she serves no purpose not even as seductress,negative
the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah richard brooks but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop who plays a gaunt fellow named curve,negative
iggy all bones veins and drawl is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film,negative
like all good things here hes dispatched too soon and without much imagination,negative
in the meantime were subjected to tedious glimpses of judahs compound where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in sm fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they werent distinctly secondhand,negative
even the soundtrack is tired,negative
more than anything ive seen from hollywood lately city of angels smacks baldly of product its a movie with a lousy script but a great look,negative
critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope but his work isnt that bad per se,negative
hes got a good eye and some intriguing visual ideas if anything this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery,negative
his major stylistic failing is that he cant seem to direct an action scene and the quick nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie,negative
but as director he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasnt the performers who couldnt and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved,negative
who bought david s goyers anemic script anyway,negative
the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference,negative
capsule a hamhanded and morality play masquerading as entertainment so muddled it doesnt even know what its really advocating if anything,negative
a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations and its easy to see why it presents a strong almost rancorously so story it is full of good actors samuel l jackson matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock kevin spacey charles dutton and its ostensibly about some important social issue that were all tangling with,negative
it is not however a good movie and all of the reasons ive listed above have something to do with why,negative
right from the beginning the movie is deadset on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible,negative
a pair of redneck whites boozed and drugged out of their minds kidnap a young black girl abuse and rape her horribly and leave her for dead,negative
after their arrest their father jackson takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial,negative
mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics,negative
the acting is not quite what it should be given the cast we have,negative
sandra bullock who is a good actress but not a serious one looks clueless spaceys accent switches itself on and off at random and hes given a totally thankless role to play as well a role without an iota of depth and mcconaugheys role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box,negative
the most memorable role is donald sutherlands and his is a bit part,negative
i always consider it an index of a movies desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact,negative
there is one scene a riot outside the courtroom that should have created incredible tension but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this,negative
because the movie doesnt know what its really about it cant generate any genuine tension and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting,negative
one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk crossburners which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic,negative
i was reminded of the despicable betrayed which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile graphic acts of racism as little more than an attentiongetter,negative
the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes,negative
first of all the jackson character is not hard to judge theres no tension in his dilemma,negative
hes selfadmittedly guilty and should be sent to jail no matter how moral his crusade,negative
the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him if he was white is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie but its never developed into an organic component of the story,negative
it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics,negative
another mistake is in motivational logic by not having the two white thugs arraigned first or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence say we have that much less empathy for jacksons character,negative
im probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped we are automatically supposed to feel empathy for him but thats precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible,negative
see the virgin spring for more on that note,negative
is jacksons character then simply insane,negative
that prospect isnt given terribly serious treatment either,negative
one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works or how lawyers get their information,negative
mcconaugheys character makes an important slipup late in the movie when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense,negative
how did the prosecution get this information,negative
how come he didnt get it,negative
the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movies way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slambang fashion,negative
this is the biggest problem the movie isnt about jacksons character or his dilemma or this case or any of its frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction characters,negative
its not ultimately about anything at all except its stupid geareddown plot which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending,negative
at two and a half hours the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten theres endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing and no writing about the material that should really matter,negative
its all handwaving,negative
the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair,negative
its not easy to make a movie about something,negative
the other day i saw kurosawas phenomenal rashomon a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality or dont,negative
a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as ive seen in a long time,negative
idle hands is distasteful crass and derivative,negative
if an original thought found its way into this horrorcomedy it would die of loneliness,negative
plus you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teenagers the week after the tragedy in littleton colo,negative
the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teenagers,negative
the plot what little there is deals with anton devon sawa a highschool slacker whos hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed,negative
along the way the hand kills antons parents and his two best friends,negative
the friends also slackers are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them,negative
that is the level of thiss atrocitys humor,negative
the movie treats death as a joke,negative
idle hands is gruesome and morbid,negative
the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish,negative
i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen,negative
it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life,negative
and i can only presume that the writers of idle hands terri hughes and ron milbauer were trying to make some statement about todays young people and their values in a satiric vein,negative
however its hard to laugh at death these days especially ones involving young people,negative
with the real horrors of the world put before us on television a stale pastry such as idle hands should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths,negative
idle hands is bad no matter the circumstances in the world outside,negative
but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings,negative
the time is not right for this type of movie,negative
and as far as idle hands goes the time may never be right,negative
this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema,negative
about an hour or so into the jackal a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out i hope she gets killed now,negative
at that point it hit me i didnt care for any of the characters being played by actors i didnt really like,negative
when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because hes being played by sidney poitier you know somethings rotten in the state of denmark,negative
every year a couple films like this are released,negative
you know the cheap action packed international espionnage film featuring a semipromising premise some bigname actors usually bruce willis and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago,negative
this was the third one of 97 following the very lackluster the saint which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain,negative
the jackal tries to mix both elements,negative
and you thought the saint was bad,negative
the jackal is loosely very loosely i hope based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ive yet to see the day of the jackal which featured apparently a suave hitman called the jackal played by edward fox trying to assasinate charles degaule,negative
well welcome to the 90s where a sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying to kill the head of the fbi or,negative
is he,negative
after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother killed in the opening scenes the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere from helsinki to virginia setting up an elaborate scheme wherein hell be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion,negative
and like the saint the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people,negative
the agent working on the case cater preston sidney poitier yes that sidney poitier working with a russian agent valentina koslova diane venora lady capulet from romeo juliet gives up early on and meets with an exira man declan mulqueen richard gere putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of 97 whos in a massachusetts jail but who has apparently seen the jackal who has been eluding the law forever,negative
soon hes out working with the two untrusting agents and trying to help them catch him,negative
there are numerous problems with the film and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on,negative
the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller but save a couple moments the film never achieves suspense or even a sense of intrigue,negative
sure the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register,negative
the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience or even an entertaining one,negative
it doesnt help that the plot is designed to be complex but falls into so many problems like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances,negative
the script of the jackal is a complete mess mostly because it cant decide what it wants to focus on,negative
is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer,negative
is it a film about a nasty amoral hitman whos in everything for the money,negative
or is it a combination of both,negative
the jackal aims for the latter but never focuses in on either character,negative
the connection between the two feels completely edited so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan you wonder how he recognized him so fast,negative
the worst part is the little past they try to give declan most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then,negative
the supporting characters are worse,negative
sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role that of a man who is just stern sometimes and other times more giving and likable,negative
what is poitier doing here,negative
hes one of the best living actors,negative
does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this,negative
diane venoras russian character is almost as bad with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth and a plastered on expressionless facade,negative
its not that anyones bad here its that they have nothing to do,negative
the plot is a joke feeling like it was pasted together by someone in postproduction who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time,negative
the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain,negative
there are several times where hes in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill,negative
take a scene where hes being followed by some agents into a parking garage he quickly sprays his car another color and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it,negative
doesnt killing someone attract more attention than it does distract,negative
and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place,negative
geez,negative
is there anything good here,negative
well a,negative
couple things,negative
i did like williss icy expressions he may not have been real suave or anything but some of his looks are worth a chuckle,negative
richard gere has a couple of good moments making his character as likable as he possibly could have,negative
and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder jack black and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man which has its share of a couple good jokes most particular a kiss by willis,negative
but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go theyre just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is the jackal,negative
director michael catonjones who directed the far superior rob roy has made a film that is made very couple months one that is unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retroclancy kinda way,negative
every now and then the filmmakers get it right clear and present danger which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way but the jackal is an example of when they go completely wrong,negative
a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city,negative
the lawyer kevin lomax keanu reeves is not offered a job yet he is asked to simply pick a jury,negative
he accepts,negative
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm,negative
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money but a gorgeous apartment,negative
he convinces his wife mary ann charlize theron to make the move to new york,negative
the first case given to him is a big test a winless case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement,negative
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal,negative
his new boss and partner in the firm john milton al pacino is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing explaining many of his philosophies on law women and sex and angles the promise of a blissful wealthy life,negative
kevins next case is a dream case given to him by milton himself much to the chagrin to his colleagues defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law,negative
although kevins career is taking off his home life is not doing very well,negative
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems,negative
she is experiencing severe depression over kevins long hours and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls their faces becoming horribly disfigured,negative
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife,negative
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with then focus all of his attention on his wife,negative
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer connie nielson also working with the firm,negative
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home,negative
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife and gets disturbing news from his mother judith ivey about the mystery concerning the identity of his father,negative
he also starts to lose control of his case,negative
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man,negative
that man is his boss mr milton a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself,negative
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store,negative
but how do you defeat the devil,negative
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd,negative
do filmmakers really believe that normal courtroom drama doesnt fit the bill and they have to juice them up,negative
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom which wouldnt have been too bad if it werent keanu reeves trying to pull it off,negative
i give reeves credit for trying hard but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short,negative
charlize theron defines the term overthetop in her performance as mary ann lomax a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in 2 days in the valley,negative
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess,negative
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil and you can tell he is having fun doing so but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him,negative
its pretty standard stuff including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom,negative
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled but i have to get something off of my chest,negative
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called wisdom with emilio estevez and demi moore and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do,negative
what i like to call guess what it was all a dream scenario,negative
in wisdom the two lead characters are killed at the end only to have one of the characters wake up from an apparent and say gosh im glad that didnt really happen,negative
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with,negative
well the same thing happens in the devils advocate and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan since it failed and he is the devil but the point is that the last 90 of the film didnt happen,negative
i know its a stretch after all it is a movie and nothing really happened but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that,negative
of course the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one,negative
as i recall wisdom was a decent film,negative
the devils advocate is not,negative
the devils advocate,negative
directed by taylor hackford john milton al pacino kevin lomax keanu,negative

written by randy turgeon march 18 1998,negative
the u s army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done,negative
one particular field manual is known as the fm 225 which among other things covers the practice of saluting,negative
under the saluting section is a subsection which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer,negative
the salute is rendered by the highestranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail,negative
in any event the salute is rendered only by the man or woman in charge rather than by the whole group,negative
almost at the very beginning of the generals daughter we see a generals motorcade passing a work detail,negative
everyone salutes,negative
it looked impressive but it just wasnt right,negative
that little bit showed me that someone either didnt do the appropriate research or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene,negative
in fact this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie,negative
what results is a film that looks good but like that one scene just isnt right,negative
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example,negative
paul brenner john travolta is an agent for the armys criminal investigation division undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale,negative
prior to the transaction the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isnt the unscrupulous supply sergeant hes supposed to be and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living,negative
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark well just say that it involves propellers,negative
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding generals daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson is found naked bound and dead on one of the bases training ranges,negative
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder,negative
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary,negative
it gives no insight into brenner other than the fact that hes a little cocky,negative
does the arms subplot turn up later,negative
no so why add this extra running time to the film,negative
the answer it looked cool,negative
or how about the atmosphere,negative
the beginning of the generals daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors over water all backed up with bayouesque music,negative
nice immersion in the setting but it soon doesnt matter for when the films plot shifts over to the murder investigation so does the entire mood,negative
no attention is paid to the location of the story and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme,negative
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie,negative
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside,negative
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie,negative
as ive already mentioned an entire section of the film doesnt jibe with the rest and the characterization only adds to the difficulty,negative
brenner who comes across as a man with little respect for authority suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell james cromwell and utters some of the corniest yes sir s ive ever heard,negative
he even delivers an emotioncharged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the generals daughter even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous,negative
sunhill who initially comes across as a professional investigator utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information and even revels in her ingenuity,negative
both characters are protagonists but its hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place and in some cases simply unappealing,negative
i could imagine that during filming west would shoot a scene then take the actors aside and tell them lets do it again but this time i want more,negative
i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good in this film they overact in most of their scenes,negative
an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the generals aide colonel fowler,negative
i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention,negative
a far cry from his days as linc in the mod squad i cant help but think he was acting from wests direction,negative
a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist john beasly and a young female private ariyan a johnson make their scenes nearly impossible to bear,negative
the only two actors who seem to have escaped wests influence are james woods who provides a good performance as colonel moore elisabeths mentor at the psychological operations unit and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police,negative
woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with peoples minds and does so without ever taking it over the top,negative
hutton just kind of hangs around but at least he wasnt overacting,negative
i havent read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based but ill bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form,negative
the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished,negative
every time were presented with some new aspect to the case west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like its the most momentous discovery ever but the information is not used by the investigators at all,negative
instead when conclusions are drawn they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts but lucky guesses instead,negative
the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects then letting them guess who the killer was,negative
wouldve been over in a half hour,negative
the film finishes with a sort of bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning,negative
literally during the closing credits we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off,negative
they both seem kind of happy,negative
maybe they were driving away from simon west,negative
kate jennifer aniston is having some problems,negative
it appears the twentyeight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired,negative
she learns that her problems are related as the owner of her advertising agency mr mercer kevin dunn explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company,negative
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company taking clients with her,negative
a solution presents itself in nick jay mohr a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with,negative
kates boss darcy illeana douglas uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick,negative
kate is at first repulsed by the idea but after getting immediate positive results she pursues it,negative
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan,negative
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc,negative
at a dinner with kates bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up,negative
she meets nick to propose the plan,negative
he accepts,negative
kates new status brings unexpected results in other areas,negative
the office bad boy sam kevin bacon who wouldnt give kate the time of day now does,negative
now that she is engaged he pursues an affair with her as doing so would destroy her good girl image hence sams sudden interest,negative
things start to fall apart for kate as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her and does not wish to break up with her,negative
after some provoking nick does oblige but problems continue for kate,negative
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available,negative
or maybe kate does like nick but reconciliation will force her to admit her lies to her employer,negative
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother olympia dukakis who wants her to get married and settle down,negative
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is from the waist up only wearing a bra,negative
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one,negative
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer,negative
its like the director said well we know the story is formulaic and the performances arent that great so what the heck lets show jennifers assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating,negative
quite frankly its insulting,negative
i dont think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie,negative
she did a decent enough job in ed burns shes the one because it was a smaller and supporting role and she just doesnt deliver the goods effectively in this movie,negative
her performance was not convincing,negative
unfortunately as far as romantic comedies go this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies,negative
the film is similar to my best friends wedding in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions gets no sympathy from me when things go awry,negative
i didnt care for how quickly kate puts down nicks profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasnt glamorous enough for her coworkers,negative
at least my best friends wedding changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending,negative
no such luck with picture perfect,negative
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away including a couple that really made no sense,negative
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first let alone consider a relationship,negative
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick,negative
throw in the fact that i dont think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision,negative
i believe that kate liked him but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away,negative
i doubt it,negative
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple,negative
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers,negative
well i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars then that would make sense,negative
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron,negative
kate jennifer aniston nick jay,negative
mohr sam kevin,negative
bacon mercer kevin,negative

www xtdl comcanran,negative
my giant begins with a monologue thats more funny than not and a distinctive princess bride medieval fairytaleinthe 90s feel,negative
i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy billy crystal is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream,negative
and when sammy meets max his giant mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan there is magic in the air albeit it a bit goofy i loved every minute of it,negative
the film of course plays on the size difference between the two and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects,negative
i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a maxsized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons,negative
i also liked jere burns from tvs something so right performance as the director of the film in romania,negative
at this point the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand particularly during his fastpaced first scene,negative
it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech,negative
however about the time muresan becomes coherent the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive,negative
off the high board,negative
suddenly we are expected to believe sammy is a dowhateverittakes slime ball,negative
up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure but he didnt come off as a desperate jerk,negative
if he had the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical,negative
but now in new york we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs midgets wrestling match which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film,negative
indeed many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces,negative
this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal when sammy gets max a role in a big hollywood movie filming in las vegas,negative
while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation rather than because the film demanded it,negative
and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare,negative
at this point i found myself thinking were supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film,negative
then i realized he was and i was watching it,negative
in the final third the film undergoes another transformation this time to unbridled sentimentality,negative
note major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph,negative
max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love lillianna who hasnt seen him since he was a normalsized kid,negative
her refusal to see max unbeknownst to him leads us to an awkward ends justify the means scene as sammys wife serena played nicely by kathleen quinlan poses as lillianna,negative
i found this scene offensive,negative
not only did it rely on deception to induce warm fuzzy feelings from the audience it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle which i thought was quite undeserved,negative
i think max could have handled the truth gratuitous illness and all,negative
late in the film we learn max and in fact all giants have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably,negative
this could be an enlightening revelation but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammys transformation into a caring sensitive guy and hey a great dad and husband too,negative
my giant suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions,negative
a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on maxs struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammys struggles to get money and become a better person,negative
in this scenario maxs illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator,negative
sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally,negative
instead were apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end but were not allowed to focus on max,negative
crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances but in the end my giant left me feeling like id been fed gruel from a giant spoon,negative
plot a little boy born in east germany named hansel loves the american music,negative
one day he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g i but first he must get a sex change enter hedwig,negative
once married the two move to the states but quickly thereafter get a divorce,negative
at that point hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy who soon turns into a star,negative
that boy also turns his back on hedwig and it isnt long before hedwig puts together own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants,negative
this is the story of life told via flashbacks and musical numbers,negative
critique an artsyfartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell doesnt really come together as a whole with overthetop symbolism incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through,negative
in fact this isnt so much of a realistic articulate behindthescenes look at the rise of a rock n roll star as it is an ambiguous overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet,negative
i guess that i was expecting the former going in,negative
the film is somewhat interesting to a point but i was personally never able to involve myself too much as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant,negative
but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience,negative
chances are that if you are a fan of the wall the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla queen of the desert the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point and provide the lyrics of their song onscreen,negative
well i personally dont care for those films and didnt really get into the whole show atmosphere of this movie either,negative
i guess i mightve looked at it all too literally but like i said earlier i just didnt care enough about the characters to delve into the so the butterfly represents his freedom,negative
side of things,negative
all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didnt make me feel any more fulfilled,negative
what was hedwigs relationship with that other member of his band with the beard,negative
what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie,negative
was that an actual sequence or a fantasy,negative
what ever happened to the lawsuit,negative
and more,negative
all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat,negative
if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover sexuality then thats one thing but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well,negative
i didnt get it,negative
the films humor also didnt tickle my funny bone either,negative
then again ive seen many a film in these arthouse theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen,negative
some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added atmosphere of a plant called marijuana and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements in order to jazz up that experience,negative
but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent funny musical with a transsexual twist i didnt leave the theater very satisfied,negative
i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle wrapped in metaphors dramatics and more questions than answers,negative
i will on the other hand definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film john cameron mitchell who is also the man who wrote directed and created the play on which this movie is based and the tunes which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols david bowie and the whole 70s glamrock scene,negative
note btw it seems as though pretty much every single mainstream critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom and thought that it was really funny to boot so you might want to take that into consideration yourself,negative
but having said that the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the official critics while i a regular joblo in the audience just wouldnt get what all the fuss was about,negative
this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews,negative
wheres joblo coming from,negative
moulin rouge 810 grease 810 everyone says i love you 510 the opposite of sex 810 dancer in the dark 510 o brother where art thou 710 loves labours lost 810,negative
any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project as a perfect murder illustrates,negative
frankly dial m for murder is not one of the master directors greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement,negative
unfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace a little a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of a wouldbe 90s thriller,negative
almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities,negative
the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in whats going on so that these flaws in logic dont become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled,negative
unfortunately in a perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as theyre happening,negative
this is a very bad sign,negative
not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder,negative
of course in the case of a perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters,negative
a perfect murder isnt a strict remake of dial m for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knotts play which was also the source material for hitchcocks version as well as a 1981 madefortv retelling,negative
emily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street moverandshaker steven hayes michael douglas,negative
their marriage isnt going well emily resents stevens controlling instincts and as a form of rebellion she is having an affair with a penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen,negative
when steven learns of the relationship he decides to confront david but his approach isnt that of a typical cuckolded husband,negative
instead of yelling or threatening steven offers david a proposal thats too good to resist for 500 000 in cash 100 000 before the rest after he is to break into stevens new york apartment and kill emily,negative
of course after getting the first payment david never bothers to ask how hes supposed to get the rest,negative
ultimately im not sure which of the three main characters were supposed to be sympathetic to the coldhearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing to do the deed for halfamillion or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair,negative
not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but theyre not interesting,negative
its possible to make a good movie with detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has to be something compelling about them which in this case there isnt,negative
steven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes,negative
the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks,negative
michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep hes gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife,negative
gwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here,negative
she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998s worst thrillers the other being hush,negative
at least viggo mortensen g i,negative
jane has a little fun with his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies,negative
the thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as a police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emilys best friend,negative
a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end,negative
there arent many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start,negative
its surprising to see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs to earn a living,negative
its just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough,negative
im a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamsons work,negative
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain,negative
with teaching mrs tingle his directorial debut williamson has reached the end of his rope,negative
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here,negative
the components are all there including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to,negative
but where are the thrills,negative
the laughs,negative
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge,negative
and what a shame that is,negative
i loved the scream films heck i even enjoyed the scifi goofiness of the faculty,negative
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office,negative
teaching mrs tingle a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers may put an end to his reign,negative
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties,negative
i still have my faith but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past,negative
the title character of his pet project is a vicious uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously overthetop by british actress helen mirren,negative
mrs tingle is basically every students worst nightmare a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hardworking of her pupils,negative
the principal michael mckean is horrified of her and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members,negative
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way,negative
mirrens performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink,negative
in other words its a poor substitute for williamsons best work,negative
the plot is a big problem here,negative
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director,negative
the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann an overachiever hoping to get a college scholarship,negative
but typical mrs tingle says her history project which she worked on for countless hours is laughable,negative
later on while studying in the gymnasium a classmate barry watson offers her a photocopied duplicate of mrs tingles final exam,negative
leigh anns best friend marisa coughlan encourages her to use it,negative
alas the old hag herself finds the three scheming and snatches the test and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning,negative
in the morning,negative
how convenient,negative
the three students head to mrs tingles house attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh anns name,negative
things get out of hand and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle,negative
the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her,negative
of course not everything goes entirely to plan,negative
besides pointless subplots involving the football coach jeffrey tambor horribly wasted there is little by way of actual progress,negative
there is no urgency to the situation little tension or laughs are involved,negative
the humor is completely inconsistent,negative
after many of the jokes the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze,negative
you continue to await some momentum in the story something that could possibly revive the slow pace,negative
a moment like that never arises,negative
williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players including the talented mckean and larry sanders vet tambor,negative
and the beautiful vivica a fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor and then williamson disposes of her character entirely,negative
on the plus side holmes and coughlan are admirable with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher,negative
while everything is pretty lifeless teaching mrs tingle remains watchable,negative
there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script,negative
mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching,negative
she is convincingly evil and fun to watch but even her gifted delivery cant save individual scenes that flounder in boredom,negative
if there is one word for the movie surrounding her it would be disappointing,negative
basically kevin williamson is his worst enemy here,negative
his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated not that his writing here is especially good,negative
we will see when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas whether williamson is for real,negative
synopsis al simmons topnotch assasin with a guilty conscience dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell,negative
making a pact with malebolgia a chief demon there simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn a general in hells army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives chains and a morphing cape,negative
sullen wise cogliostro and flatulating wisecracking violator vy for spawns attention,negative
comments when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics where he had made a name for himself as a firstrate comic book penciller on the spiderman titles to join the newlyformed creatorowned image comics a new comic book legend was born spawn,negative
mcfarlanes spawn immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s,negative
mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max,negative
the early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlanes genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing,negative
with the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros s batman film franchise a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn,negative
in the summer of 1997 hence new line cinema released spawn a liveaction film based on the groundbreaking series,negative
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed by how much spawn misses the mark,negative
what happened,negative
why is spawn so bad,negative
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo,negative
i dont think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the film,negative
i place the blame in part on the recent hollywood trend fueled by public demand apparently for special effects blowout movies utilizing the latest computer technology,negative
these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics,negative
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons,negative
a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid dont get me wrong but because the script and cast arent engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath,negative
spawns translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level,negative
mcfarlanes spawn was a tortured hero,negative
a mercenary by trade al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda,negative
having died and journeyed to hell he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda,negative
simmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body a creepy mess and his wife married,negative
despite his sometimes violent nature readers couldnt help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld,negative
spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so,negative
when the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching,negative
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world do not help matters,negative
spawn in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on a villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman,negative
john leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai white al simmons spawn is second,negative
i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator,negative
the film however spends so much time on the violators offensive antics that they grate on the nerves,negative
apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violators lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave,negative
leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the film,negative
michael jai white a relative newcomer to theatrical releases seems to be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on,negative
more time needed to be spent on whites character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings,negative
a special note should be made about martin sheen as the overthetop obnoxious evil general wynn,negative
easily the hammiest performance in the movie its hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now,negative
sheens excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film,negative
many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down,negative
mtvstyle jerky inyourface editing is one of them,negative
flames for example roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting,negative
cogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as a poor narrator for the film,negative
he goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of spawns humanity is left remains to be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another,negative
the music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue,negative
loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes,negative
to be fair however marilyn mansons long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawns return to earth while filter and the crystal methods cant you trip like i do proves a surprisingly fitting theme song,negative
for as good a comic book as it is spawn did not spawn a good movie,negative
spawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development,negative
it receives two stars for its technically welldone special effects,negative
many other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better,negative
rated pg13 spawn seems more violent than many rrated movies and probably wouldnt be appropriate for the very young,negative
the happy bastards quick movie review,negative
wild wild west,negative
a better name for this movie mightve been wild wild waste,negative
warner bros in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie had managed to lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mibs success in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster a contemporary bigscreen update to the classic fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad,negative
but somehow they ran into a problem along the way,negative
they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that wouldve made all the difference a story writer,negative
wild wild wests story and script was compiled by six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black ed solomon,negative
if warner bros had gotten him the movie wouldve possibly been five times better than what it is,negative
heck ten times,negative
as is however the story and screenplay is a mess filled with dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as hes performing them and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well,negative
heres the story us army member james west will smith teams up with creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him to roll around in a steamcontrolled wheelchair,negative
they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path,negative
as i said the way the script unfolds is a complete mess,negative
but the acting doesnt help either,negative
kevin kline is miserable as gordon failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado,negative
smith seems to be having a better time as west although hes not nearly as charming as he was in mib,negative
branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps to the point where we cant even stand to look at him or his strange beard,negative
and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention,negative
her acting is barely passable but what a breath of fresh ass,negative
director barry sonnenfeld isnt of great help either,negative
even though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost,negative
its as if he feels hes directing a tv movie a big nono when youre helming whats supposed to be a bigscreen hit,negative
last but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable,negative
at one point smith defies gravity when first boarding klines train,negative
he jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while its still in motion,negative
also he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks,negative
last but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows hes not kissing a woman as hes looking through a peephole at the enemy,negative
the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects,negative
the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show,negative
theres also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity,negative
i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west but it really isnt possible,negative
if the racist and sex jokes dont bother you the performances will,negative
if the performances dont bother you the story will,negative
if the story doesnt bother you the racist and sex jokes will,negative
theres no end to the vicious circle,negative
go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats,negative
youll have a better time,negative
if you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant,negative
i bet he wishes he were somewhere else,negative
the tagline on random hearts reads in a perfect world they never would have met,negative
in a perfect world i never would have seen this movie,negative
the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film kay chandler kristin scott thomas and dutch van den broeck harrison ford are the only two major characters alive resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production,negative
dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department,negative
kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire,negative
although they both think they are happily married their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs,negative
dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners they subsequently discover the affair,negative
the rest of the film is the pointless unrealistic and oftentimes boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to and getting to know each other in the process,negative
two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film,negative
dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare,negative
all the great stereotypes get pulled including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter,negative
kays distraction from the films primary focus is her campaign for reelection and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal,negative
these sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points but the film seems afraid to explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth and consequently suffers,negative
random hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells,negative
although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other,negative
there is plenty of opportunity dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships,negative
veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack and critically acclaimed upandcomer dylan baker both have cameo roles but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both,negative
other than its weak plot it is hard to criticize random hearts,negative
however it is also hard to compliment it,negative
had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake rather than the dry one that equates to be,negative
lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient,negative
great acting music and cinematography were nice but too many dull subplots and characters made the film hard to follow,negative
ralph fiennes strange days schindlers list gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy,negative
the story revolves around his past in flashback form making it even more confusing,negative
anyway he is taken in by hana juliette binoche the horseman on the roof a boring wartorn nurse,negative
she was never really made into anything until she met an indian towards the end developing yet another subplot,negative
count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger willem dafoe basquiat,negative
his love kirstin scott thomas mission impossible was severely injured in a plane crash and eventually died in a cave,negative
he returned to find her dead and was heartbroken,negative
so he flew her dead body somewhere but was shot down from the ground,negative
dont get the wrong idea it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting but good is the last thing this film is,negative
maybe if it were an hour less it may have been tolerable but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle,negative
the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography,negative
other than these the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film,negative
jack frost is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching,negative
this does not come as a surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other,negative
jack frost michael keaton is a struggling middleaged rock musician who loves his wife gabby kelly preston and 11yearold son charlie joseph cross but doesnt spend nearly enough time with them,negative
when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas,negative
halfway there jack has second thoughts but on his way back home is in a car accident and dies,negative
switch forward a year christmas is approaching once again and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jacks death,negative
when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died the snowman outside the house is taken over by jacks spirit,negative
jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise,negative
frosty the snowman is a classic cartoon and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated but as a liveaction film it doesnt work at all,negative
after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established jack frost quickly goes downhill especially once the snowman comes into play,negative
since jack has been deceased for a whole year you would think there would be many questions to ask him such as what happens after you die,negative
or how does it feel to be a snowman,negative
but instead the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie,negative
the performances are respectable enough but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this,negative
michael keaton at least got off easy since he disappears after the first twenty minutes but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here,negative
i have always liked kelly preston,negative
she is clearly a talented charismatic actress but has never been given a good role in her life usually having to settle for a onedimensional supporting character as in 1997s nothing to lose and addicted to love,negative
joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent,negative
in one of the only subplots that actually works due to its wittiness henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman,negative
this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side however by the triedandtrue main plot at hand which is the sappy story of a father and son,negative
since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid cringeinducing lines of dialogue,negative
some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father you da man says charlie,negative
no i da snowman replies jack,negative
or how about this little zinger coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out snowdad is better than no dad,negative
do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this,negative
the snowman created by john hensons creature shop is more believable than the snowman from last years unintentionally hilarious directtovideo horror flick also called jack frost but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects,negative
either way it was an awful lot of work to go through just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project,negative
as a seasonal holiday picture jack frost is pretty much a clunker,negative
a better christmas film from this year is ill be home for christmas,negative
better yet my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film such as its a wonderful life a christmas story or prancer,negative
jack frost is an earnest but severely misguided film and children as well as adults deserve better,negative
i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent anyway,negative
varsity blues is the best film of 1999 thus far,negative
unfortunately it is also the first film i have seen from 1999,negative
it is another one of those smalltown sports movies that involves a flawed but goodheartedfrom 1999,negative
it is another one of those smalltown sports movies that involves a flawed but goodhearted protagonist a rough and meanspirited coach and the big game,negative
by the end will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph,negative
will everyone in the town turn against the coach,negative
will the team win the climactic game,negative
do cats bathe themselves regularly,negative
the socalled hero in question is john moxin james van der beek a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the deadend town,negative
at least hes got the right idea since west canaan texas is portrayed in the film as frankly pathetic with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming,negative
heck in one scene the front page of the towns newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers big win the night before,negative
when the teams star quarterback is severely injured tearing the ligaments in his leg john finds himself taking over as the teams leader but his few minutes of glory do not last long as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend amy smart when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ali larter,negative
and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics the team loses their secondtolast game putting john at feuds with the coach jon voight who like gary oldman is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the bad guy,negative
worse yet the coach is threatening to ruin johns scholarship chances if the badgers dont win their final game,negative
the plotting of varsity blues is as old as the hills and contains every cliche in the book,negative
admittedly i was never exactly bored while i was watching it but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained,negative
throughout all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983s all the right moves,negative
one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were least of all certainly not john who played by van der beek of tvs dawsons creek is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities,negative
while i probably shouldnt blame this on van der beek since the inauspicious and bythenumbers screenplay by w peter iliff isnt of any help he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in all the right moves,negative
the story revolving around john meanwhile is extemely thin throughout particularly for its 104minute running time and it alternates between uninspired comic relief as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club and heavyhanded melodrama,negative
the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot but we also learned very little about her which is unfortunate since amy smart whom i dont think ive seen before in past films is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence,negative
smart does not allow her character to become the passive girlfriend instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions,negative
its too bad the camera didnt linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts,negative
the adult characters probably fare the worse of any since they all must play residents of a dimwitted town that cares about nothing but football,negative
johns relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance,negative
his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university but john doesnt want any part of that,negative
his mother stands beside her big strong husband and is a passive female,negative
finally jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than onedimensional,negative
saving varsity blues from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences including one set in the sex education class which did get a laugh out of me,negative
the scenes of playing football were wellshot and thankfully didnt overstay their welcome as many sports films fall victim to,negative
but leaving the theater the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made,negative
i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood,negative
do we really need another highschool sports film,negative
no we dont and certainly not one of this lowcaliber which felt like a cutandpaste job of spare parts from much better but similar films,negative
varsity blues no doubt is the first one however to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts,negative
terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones world war ii novel,negative
unfortunately he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3hour long pseudoepic,negative
this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte,negative
the best scene is when nick noltes character lt col tall is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt staros elias koteas to execute an order,negative
noltes reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career,negative
had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn woody harrelson and john cusack he could have made a truly great film,negative
instead malick saddled the film with plodding pacing unnecessary flashbacks and a voiceover narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story,negative
the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry,negative
with a lot of editing the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film,negative
hopefully the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration and perhaps will even provide for an alternate shorter version of the film,negative
i give this film,negative

reviewed by dennis schwartz,negative
a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a depraved butcher,negative
the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects,negative
the world has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no meat so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain almost as valued a commodity,negative
thats the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them,negative
this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the codirectors marc pierre jeunet,negative
it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future,negative
an excircus clown named louison dominique pinon the films toogoodtobetrue hero answers an ad for work as a handyman for clapet jeanclaude dreyfus and the butcher and landlord offers him room and board in his house,negative
the butchers clumsy and nearsighted daughter julie marielaure dougnac falls in love with the skinny weird looking clown and the two make some music together with her playing the cello and him a saw,negative
they are the innocents surrounded by a boarding house of misfits suffering from fear and watched over by her overbearing father who has lured into his tenement the clown as he has his past innocent victims so that he can put his cleaver to him and then sell him as meat which he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes up the tenement,negative
the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents who do not trust each other,negative
there are two youngsters boban janevski mikael todde who do any kind of mischief they can,negative
a frog man howard vernon who lives with water on the floor so he can raise his frogs and snails that he eats,negative
two brothers mathou kube who create little cowmoo novelty toys,negative
a man holgado who sells a bullshit detector to the butcher for his piece of meat,negative
a slutty woman karin viard who lives with the butcher and only wants his meat,negative
the aristocratic woman silvie laguna who tries numerous times to commit suicide but is too inept to do it right,negative
the tenants are too afraid to come out at night because they know what the butcher is up to so they are forced to communicate with each other through a pipe that runs through the building in one scene they are all in musical harmony to the lovemaking of the butcher and his gal as their bedsprings squeak,negative
there is also a sexcrazed postman chick ortega who lusts for the butchers daughter and carries a gun while delivering the mail,negative
there is also an underdeveloped subplot about a band of incompetent underground veggie fanatics called trogolodistes who have been summoned to rescue the clown and steal some grain,negative
the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics as the comedy seemed forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity,negative
delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin monty python fans and those who liked terry gilliams brazil a film similar in spirit,negative
the king and i a warner brothers animated musical feature recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king with obvious results,negative
when anna miranda richardson a british schoolteacher travels to saim to educate the kings martin vidnovic children she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly and must say something to the greedy ruler,negative
meanwhile the kings prime minister ian richardson the stereotypical villain plots to overthrow the king taking the throne,negative
the last and most predictable main subplot deals with the kings son allen d hong and his love for a servant tuptim armi arabe and how he conflicts with his feelings and the ancient laws of saim,negative
not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent as the king and is problems could fill the blank pages of a journal,negative
i will only note the major difficulties for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail,negative
the screenplay written by arthur rankin peter bakalian jacqeline feather and david seidler which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory as every time the obnoxious king would shout etc etc etc i would cringe,negative
literally,negative
speaking of cringing i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking,negative
besides the repetitive dialogue from the king on the whole the songs seem out of place and unlike the lyrics are unmagical,negative
the sole song which is used cleverly is getting to know you which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors which they have never been exposed to,negative
unlike disney animated features the king and is songs dont add to the film and are as uneffective as could be,negative
take the following scenario as an example as the sheer horror of the king and is music is at its worst,negative
youre being hunted by a dragon,negative
what do you do,negative
sing a happy song,negative
martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives dont make a positive,negative
believe it,negative
with the terrible dialogue that the king has along with his awful voice track the king is completely unbelievable only shows mild signs of any personality and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says etc etc etc more and more as the film progresses,negative
no personality at the beginning of the movie none at the end,negative
and where does this characters personality change,negative
hey i thought anna was supposed to change him,negative
isnt that the whole plot,negative
the prime ministers hideous sidekick darrell hammond brings his share of cringes as well oh no,negative
another one of his teeth fell out,negative
hardyharhar,negative
he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him,negative
by the way this review is going you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films hence why i hate this movie because the king and i is a disgrace to animation,negative
animated films such as 1994s the lion king and 1998s the prince of egypt are among my favorite movies of all time,negative
the animation team does design their share of well animated settings so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds,negative
i have not read the play or seen the oscar winning 1956 film adaption but from what i can tell the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play for the king and i is never magical nor interesting,negative
if it wasnt for miranda richardson who voices anna with feeling the king and i could earn the title worst movie of the decade,negative
instead the king and i will just go down as among the years worst,negative
the bottom line avoid this movie at all costs,negative
not even young children the target audience in this film will enjoy it,negative
not the slightest bit,negative
starship troopers is a bad movie,negative
i mean a really really bad movie,negative
not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood gore and body parts shown on the screen it blissfully jumps over that line apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds of which i saw many in the theatre,negative
looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best no strong lead characters a blatant disregard for physics and a very obvious naziesque theme,negative
that being said onto the review the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation whos logo bears a strong resemblance to a nazi german eagle urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs who are attempting to destroy earth,negative
the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance pledging allegiance to the federation again sound familiar,negative
as the movie progresses we are shown terror tactic training as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm and throws a knife through anothers hand,negative
eventually the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy to fight the bugs on their home planet,negative
as our faster than light travelling heroes arrive on planet they drop onto the planet and burst our of their craft brandishing,negative
what,negative
you say laser beam weapons,negative
sonic weapons,negative
phasers,negative
photon cannons,negative
nope they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns pump action rifles and tactical nuclear weapons,negative
i guess a lot of physics money rd went into travel and not weaponry,negative
as the assault begins our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon,negative
two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them and one even sees a streak fly by but disregards it as nothing,negative
this of course leads to more massive carnage blood shed and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies,negative
again i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons,negative
in the end we see neil patrick doogie howser harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat hat and gloves,negative
he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug and then proclaims that the bugs are scared,negative
this sets the troopers into a frenzy as they are now one step closer to completing their goal total genocide of a species again sound familiar,negative
i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review but given its nonexistence i may have anyway,negative
i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart but dont want to bore you too badly,negative
in short i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pronazi war film with bugs substituted for allies a drivers education accident scene film and a complete blank screen the plot of course,negative
i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone anywhere under any circumstance,negative
copyright c 1997 tim jandt,negative
retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year,negative
earlier this may leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the toprated miniseries that debuted on cbs,negative
and now director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies,negative
starring milla jovovich who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch the messenger the story of joan of arc is a disjointed and overblown historical reenactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend,negative
besson whos previous work includes the hyperactive scifi the fifth element perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in exwife jovovich because in the messenger the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience,negative
at first when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber,negative
after seeing the rousing trailer my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed milla jovovich looked superb,negative
with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance the messenger looked like a timeless epic in the making,negative
a timeless epic it is not,negative
besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style and the story behind the messenger is not entirely suited to his demands,negative
on the shoulders of bessons choppy and unexciting direction the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery,negative
there is no human exploration into the character of joan or jeanne,negative
jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective,negative
jovivichs unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard,negative
she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast,negative
jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power but mainly she looks lost,negative
quite frankly i dont know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through the messenger without a major fumble,negative
the script is chockfull of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii john malkovich and informs him of her heavenly intentions,negative
faye dunaway plays charles overbearing motherinlaw and dustin hoffman appears over twohours into the story as a character dubbed the conscience,negative
all three actors juggle limited screen time although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful,negative
the battle scenes are extremely bloody but with the presence of such jittery camera work they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like braveheart,negative
theres a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on when jeanne as a young girl watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier,negative
even his fellow troopers are petrified,negative
the messenger is also strictly a 90s update on the classic story,negative
almost too 90s it seems,negative
theres gratuitous use of the fword and a barrage of slang terms like shes nuts,negative
sprinkled throughout the screenplay,negative
i was halfexpecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib but it never happened,negative
theres also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly,negative
it seems terribly misplaced but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as the messenger almost everything does,negative
the musical score by erric serra is spectacular and the set and production designs are continuously impressive,negative
if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for then he achieves his goal,negative
but the only time the dramatics come alive in the messenger is during the closing trial in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake,negative
during these moments the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning,negative
its just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects,negative
the messenger the story of joan of arc is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf,negative
anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film,negative
despite my original hopefulness milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy,negative
nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy,negative
showgirls nc17 contains graphic nudity profanity sexual situations and violence,negative
some people however keep their clothes on,negative
you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values nor do you write reviews on them,negative
thats why this review will be short,negative
it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores,negative
there is no story script point or acting,negative
only naked bodies which is exactly the point,negative
here is the so called plot nomi the 23yearold with a dark past as a hooker has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesnt wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big fake smile,negative
no one is twisting nomis arm,negative
no one is holding her grandmother hostage,negative
she wants to do this,negative
and that is what she is doing till the end credits,negative
so whats the problem then,negative
whats the point,negative
whats the film about,negative
is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy,negative
this film can be described in one sentence obscene level of incompetence excessive stupidity in the story line gross negligence of the viewers intelligence a prurient interest in the quick buck,negative
believe me after an hour with these characters acting and script youll start hoping for someone to kill somebody,negative
elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film that is bad even for eszterhas script,negative
her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better,negative
her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public,negative
i am not a whore,negative
i am a dancer she screams but does it in such an over dramatized way that youll start laughing,negative
in fact the acting in showgirls brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level,negative
not one single achievement besides the conventional cinematography is worth mentioning,negative
it is a total waste of time and money,negative
there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence,negative
the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another,negative
its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe,negative
in my films writes director paul verhoeven basic instinct total recall i hold the mirror up to life,negative
well excuse me,negative
his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas and as he put it show the naked truth is simplified and unreal,negative
occasionally between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities screenwriter joe eszterhas the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history inserts some lines of deep morality that sound something like this hey i see you,negative
i see that youre hiding from what,negative
from you,negative
yes and even the only decent line in this film nomi is what las vegas is all about cant save showgirls from going under,negative
its a strange phenomena,negative
its not erotic because it lacks sensuality,negative
not dramatic because it lacks the acting,negative
and not intelligent because it lacks a story,negative
it is simply verhovens bad excuse for making pornography,negative
you want to see naked women,negative
bare breasts,negative
full frontals,negative
its nothing wrong with that,negative
but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store and not waste time surviving through eszterhas pathetic dialogue,negative
b qualities while its only a high budget pornfilm,negative
my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love,negative
i love ralph fiennes,negative
i love uma thurman,negative
i love sean connery,negative
hell im even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw,negative
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and ive been eagerly awaiting the film ever since,negative
a few months into the summer however i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times and that it had ended up in the midaugust dumping ground,negative
then in this final week before its official release i learned that it was not to be screened for critics,negative
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs,negative
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique,negative
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things,negative
the film i saw today didnt even meet those expectations,negative
this is a lousy incoherent mess,negative
i would slam it harder if it werent for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine lovable actors,negative
but sets are ultimately empty and the performances are completely uninspired,negative
thats the main problem with the avengers for all its hiphop flash and tidal waves none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired,negative
its like a chore a bland exercise in superhero film making,negative
it also feels like its been cut to pieces clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots,negative
this is just plain depressing,negative
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show,negative
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ive never watched an episode,negative
i wasnt alive then,negative
i dont even watch television now,negative
im very sorry that i dont have this perspective but judging from the reviews ive already read knowing the tv show just makes matters worse,negative
i didnt know and love john steed and emma peel and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles,negative
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film,negative
based on what the film told me i gather that steed fiennes is some kind of british super guy somewhat like james bond and that dr peel thurman is just a really smart doctor who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits,negative
they are to work together under mothers orders mother is played by jolly jim broadbent while his coconspirator father is played by the equallytalented fiona shaw,negative
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather,negative
his name is de wynter connery,negative
he is a crazy scottish guy,negative
our heroes had better stop him or else,negative
the weather will keep getting colder until they have to go to hell to warm up one of the films few funny lines,negative
along the way there is subplot after subplot hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere feel perfunctory and ultimately make no sense,negative
for example our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos,negative
now killer bugs dont really go with the weathercontrolling theme of the film,negative
the purpose of the bugs other than to annihilate our heroes is never established,negative
theyre never even directly connected to de wynter theyre controlled by his crazy henchman played by eddie izzard,negative
the special effects arent bad but theyre loud obnoxious and intrusive,negative
like so many scenes in the film it seems present only to keep your attention from waning,negative
and i guarantee you it will wane,negative
i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didnt do any good to think,negative
the avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved couldnt tell us what happens,negative
there are several scenes in the preview that didnt make the final cut,negative
in addition many of the sequences have irritating grainy film quality which makes it feel lowbudget the last scene is particularly bad,negative
the scenes that dont feature action should be electric thanks to our wonderful cast,negative
they arent,negative
the action scenes should be electric because this is an action film,negative
they arent either,negative
and what about this wasted cast,negative
oh it makes me weep with disappointment,negative
were talking ralph fiennes here one of the best actors working today one of the best actors ever,negative
i love the guy,negative
ive loved all his films until this one,negative
he seems like he wants to understand the film but hes as lost as we are,negative
and thurman in all of her spectacular beauty and talent cant manage to look at home here,negative
i dont blame her completely for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way and it cant be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting,negative
connery however seems the most out of it totally lacking any kind of focus or interest for that matter,negative
who is to blame,negative
is it the screenwriter don macpherson,negative
perhaps although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right,negative
is it the actors,negative
for gods sake no these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling,negative
i blame director jeremiah chechik who shouldnt have been given the task to begin with,negative
his best film benny joon is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor,negative
add to that a lack of experience in bigbudget action and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory,negative
if the avengers has a saving grace its the set design,negative
the sets by stuart craig are big colorful and often pleasing to look at,negative
i like the final setpiece on de wynters island even if none of it makes a bit of sense,negative
i admired the overhead view of the stairs showing dr peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere,negative
i also enjoyed michael kamens music score particularly in the opening credits,negative
but this stuff is routine good sets and music are nice but theres a lot more that needs to be here,negative
inspiration for instance would have been really nice,negative
maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story,negative
or a sense of purpose,negative
most of all though i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles,negative
damn this movie for not giving them the chance,negative
we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us,negative
starring lee kangsheng yang kueimei directed by tsai mingliang written by tsai and yang pingying cinematography by liao pengjung,negative
taiwan 241299,negative
the millenium approaches,negative
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city,negative
sectors of the city are being sealed quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus,negative
the virus causes people to act like insects they crawl about on all fours hide from bright lights huddle in damp corners,negative
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a weeks time,negative
residents are advised to evacuate the area asap,negative
this premisekafka by way of cronenbergis the background for the hole which could have been a great movie but sadly ends up as a waste of good ideas,negative
the quick sketch above suggests a dark absurd hallucinatory nearfuture parable of life in the late 20th century in execution however it is nothing like that,negative
the virus the evacuation the visual possiblities of the deluge these are all relegated to the background,negative
instead the hole focuses on the livesfor want of a better wordof a man lee kangsheng and a woman yang kueimei who live in the same apartment building and who have no personalities,negative
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile the charmless rooms and corridors of a postindustrial apartment complex photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible,negative
its a vivid setting but an unappealing one especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background,negative
the man lives in the apartment directly above the womans,negative
one day a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the mans living room opening into the ceiling of the womans living room,negative
this holesymbol of the solitary opening in the characters lonely compartmented livesallows them to interact in unusual and mostly nonverbal ways,negative
example the man suffering from the onset of the virus or so i assumeeverything is obscure in this movie vomits through the hole,negative
the woman wandering around in the dark accidentally puts her hand on his vomit and then cleans it up,negative
this is what passes for meaningful communication,negative
and they say romance is dead,negative
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions such as they are,negative
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people,negative
they are ciphers,negative
instead we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives we watch for instance as the woman boils some water pours it onto some noodles then eats the noodles,negative
this is as fascinating as it sounds,negative
offered as counterpointor perhaps reliefto these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers fantasies in which the woman lipsynchs to pop songs by grace chan popular so im told in 1950s china,negative
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights,negative
sometimes in these fantasies she is joined by the man,negative
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality but they fail,negative
when the man and the woman dance it seems halfhearted and listless,negative
astaire and rogers this is not,negative
even in imagination these people are numb weary boring,negative
the hole is part of the collection 2000 series a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium,negative
others include canadas last night brazils midnight and american hal hartleys the book of life,negative
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry,negative
witty energetic humane it makes the the hole seem ahem empty,negative
american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements quick cuts superficial emotions,negative
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time and call it art,negative
the hole is selfevidently a film about alienation and perhaps director tsai mingliang wants the audience to share in his characters alienation,negative
if so he succeeds,negative
perhaps it is a challenge he dares us to enjoy this movie despite his best attempts to ensure that we dont,negative
if it was a challenge i wasnt up for it,negative
it seemed like the perfect concept,negative
what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality,negative
its exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh,negative
jim carreys signed on too,negative
even better,negative
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth,negative
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldnt take a joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy,negative
yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isnt funny,negative
its not for lack of trying,negative
the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them,negative
this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult,negative
soon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second independent personality named hank a deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster,negative
this guy isnt above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which hes been insulted or holding a little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street,negative
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks,negative
some have suggested that this isnt a problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work,negative
theyre wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996s theres something about mary,negative
1999s outside providence was technically an earlier project,negative
the brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected,negative
in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleightofhand trick theyd have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion,negative
me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work,negative
having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment,negative
the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes,negative
but they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy,negative
the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p waters renee zellweger whos in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending thats entirely predictable from the getgo,negative
think charlie and irene will fall in love,negative
yeah me too,negative
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you havent already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be,negative
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value its no longer funny merely gross,negative
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry,negative
take for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon,negative
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face,negative
but by the end of the film theyre still doing the same schitck it hasnt been elevated to another funnier level and it hasnt been dropped either,negative
thats too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through,negative
me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities,negative
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions,negative
this doesnt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it,negative
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesnt go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax,negative
jim carrey is a gifted comedian both physically and vocally but hes left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in all of me,negative
its a great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny,negative
carrey doesnt pull any stunts we dont expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesnt give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting arent set up in any meaningful way,negative
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better,negative
zellwegers irene is not a strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled,negative
irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether shes ditzy clever or neither,negative
as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film,negative
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this,negative
he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected,negative
after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves,negative
maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked,negative
but i dont believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style,negative
if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and i still think they are theyll rebound just fine,negative
even after that happens though ill still consider me myself irene to be a highcaliber misfire,negative
when youve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies i guess you try video games,negative
why did i go to see mortal kombat annihilation,negative
the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw,negative
this film was a bunch of fighting yelling special effects and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack,negative
the plot is fairly simple a portal has opened between our world and the outworld allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn brian thompson to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity,negative
the good guys led by sorcerer rayden james remar and human mortal liu kang robin shou must take the fight to outworld where the fate of both worlds will be determined,negative
heres the catch they must reunite princess katana talia soto whos on the good side with her resurrected mother queen sindel musetta vander whos on the bad side for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanitys safety for another generation,negative
how this is supposed to work i still have no idea but i liked katanas line i knew love would keep us together since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh,negative
there are some seriously stupid things in this movie,negative
take for example a transportation system which utilizes the inner winds generated by earths magma flows,negative
you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast,negative
how fast,negative
as katana says you will be moving so fast it will be as if you are not moving at all,negative
what,negative
later sonya blade sandra hess goes to find jax lynn red williams otherwise known as saber on tvs american gladiators at a medical research facility on the island of oahu,negative
how do we know this is where she went,negative
theres a sign on the facilitys perimeter fence that reads medical research facility oahu hawaii,negative
remember this is not a caption but an actual sign,negative
i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are,negative
theres a lot of major flipping action too,negative
the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another,negative
do they land and immediately get into the fighting,negative
does one of them land first and catch the other off guard,negative
do they collide in midair,negative
no apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away,negative
why did they need those metal balls to travel,negative
everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b,negative
i have to admit the fight scenes are pretty good although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics,negative
the movies thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly,negative
ouch was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one,negative
you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights not plot would be the main draw since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next,negative
it seems thats all there is in this movie,negative
maybe it is,negative
as i had mentioned the acting is bad,negative
theres not one solid performance in the film although williams as jax was pretty funny,negative
after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling jax says you look good in mud,negative
no really you do,negative
remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang,negative
brian thompson who has played good guys bad guys and even an alien on tvs the xfiles but always some musclebound behemoth is your average evil demigod but its more the scripts fault than his own that he doesnt have anything original to say,negative
the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half,negative
another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking blood only appears in one scene,negative
all in all mortal kombat annihilation is loud violent shallow and marketed toward kids,negative
hey just like the video game,negative
susan grangers review of americas sweethearts,negative
what a waste of a talented cast,negative
billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan have concocted a sly provocative premise and as the opening credits roll its obvious that theyre attempting an oldfashioned romantic comedy,negative
the story involves a veteran publicist billy crystal who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director christopher walken holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room refusing to show it to anyone,negative
he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the films oncemarriedbutnowestranged stars gwen and eddie catherine zetajones john cusack theyll be so distracted that they wont remember they didnt see the movie or it wasnt what they expected,negative
and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony manning quote scandal,negative
for help he turns to gwens personal julia roberts,negative
but the laughs are few and farbetween,negative
crystals glib cynical flack isnt wickedly funny enough with a few amusing oneliners,negative
after six months under the care of a depak chopralike guru alan arkin cusacks characters too emotionally fragile lacking the necessary charisma,negative
zetajoness vain narcissistic diva is undeveloped and onedimensional,negative
only hank azaria as zetajoness muchmacho spanish lover and stanley tucci as a studio exec and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth,negative
basically we dont like these egodriven stereotypical characters let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements and joe roths direction is predictable formulaic and telegraphic,negative
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 americas sweethearts is a contrived shallow 4 as a screwball satire its strictly superficial,negative
thats exactly how long the movie felt to me,negative
there werent even nine laughs in nine months,negative
its a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man mr hugh grant a huge dork,negative
its not the whole oral thing referring to grant not me that bugs me its the fact that grant is annoying,negative
not just adam sandlerannoying were talking jim carreyannoying,negative
since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting,negative
but on the other hand since when do really bad slapstick a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grants head in joan cusacks lapa scene he paid 60 to have included in the movie and obscene double entendres robin williams the obstetrician tells grants pregnant girlfriend she has a big pussy referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat but nonetheless grant paid 60 to have the exchange included in the movie pass for comedy,negative
nine months is a predictable cookiecutter movie with no originality in humor or plot,negative
hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist,negative
why a child psychologist,negative
so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange,negative
kid my dads an asshole,negative
grant flutters eyelashes offers a nervous smile then responds in his annoying english accent and ithinkiactuallyhave talent attitude could you possibly elaborate on that,negative
kid my dads a huge asshole,negative
more like a hugh asshole but thats beside the point which is nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief,negative
so anyway grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction fluttered eyelashes nervous smiles,negative
this paves the way for every possible birth gag in the book especially since grants equally annoying friends wife is also pregnant,negative
the annoying friend is played by tom arnold who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick none of which is funny such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed arnie the dinosaur you draw your own parallels on that one in a toy store,negative
the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway as an artist with a fear of and simultaneous longing for commitment,negative
not even robin williams who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics has much humor,negative
his is a onejoke character the old foreignguywhomispronouncesenglish stereotype did someone say yakov smirnov,negative
thats my favorite vodka by the way hence the line now its time to take a look at your volvo another nasty but unamusing joke except this one goes right over the ten year olds heads while the adults simultaneously groan,negative
nine months is a complete failure low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud unfunny slapstick failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy,negative
hugh grants sunset boulevard arrest please no caughtwithhispantsdown jokes may bring more people into the theaters but they certainly wont leave with a smile on their faces not after 90 minutes of grants nervous smiles,negative
everything in the movie is so forced so unauthentic that anyone with an i q,negative
over 80 sorry hugh will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire,negative
but at least they didnt spend 60 bucks for it,negative
ladybugs is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees the pathetic team who beats the champs cross dressing and the presence of rodney dangerfield,negative
this picture doesnt play like a comedy for children so who is it aimed at,negative
and why is it told like a 91minute sitcom instead of a feature film,negative
rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee a total schmuck working at a huge corporation,negative
he obviously doesnt have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead which he does by volunteering to coach the companys girls soccer team,negative
what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie jackee know absolutely nothing about the game and the players seem to know even less,negative
i didnt laugh but for some reason it didnt annoy me that much,negative
chesters fiancee bess graff thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams,negative
jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team what original story ideas,negative
what we get is just another retread of the underdog sports team mixed with some cross dressing,negative
unfortunately the film isnt smart enough to play upon the drag aspect,negative
in fact it downplays it so heavily its totally unbelievable,negative
could it be any more obvious martha is a boy,negative
he only wears a girls wig without any makeup and they dont even give him falsies,negative
brandis doesnt bother to mimic a girls voice either,negative
then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress but for what reason,negative
martha is only seen on the soccer field why would they buy a dress for her,negative
just when we think the martha character is going to be useful she disappears and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on,negative
when bess discovers whats really going on she breaks up with chester and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss,negative
this film couldve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary and bad at that,negative
theres just too much of a sitcom feel here especially during the socalled serious moments and all the confusion between the characters,negative
ive seen worse movies than ladybugs but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm so even when it turns sour it doesnt seem as bad as it is,negative
dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end but at what a price,negative
party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ive seen in awhile,negative
a late ripoff of the meatballs series the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk,negative
thats really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wisecracking jerry andrew ross has the hots for a cute blonde kerry brennan and there is a big contest in the climax,negative
how fun,negative
since party camp has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative,negative
its not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex,negative
even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick,negative
at least then it wouldnt have been such a chore to sit through,negative
never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat,negative
the comedy was easy to spot but it wasnt the least bit funny,negative
it was groaninducing,negative
constantly throghout i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything,negative
so what saves party camp from the dreaded zero star rating,negative
well thats simple jewel shepard as a flighty bimbo was admittedly fun to watch,negative
although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid lowbudget teen comedy,negative
synopsis the president of a company wants to test his selfappointed successor whos psychotic and thinks its a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall,negative
comments tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it,negative
strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotapes sticker in black marker not typically a good sign when you rent a film,negative
strike two came while the previews played,negative
did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movies quality or lack thereof while watching the trailers that come before it,negative
well the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows and they all looked bad definately not a good sign,negative
tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout,negative
about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery,negative
to be fair the first halfhour or so promises at least a watchable thriller,negative
wolf larson who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the films title,negative
james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten,negative
brolins character for some inexplicable reason thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin practically isolated with lebrock and larson whom hes decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company,negative
by the time the characters arrive at the cabin this film begins to become tedious,negative
apparently brolins successors test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing which dont seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city,negative
but then again what do i know about business,negative
i do think though that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch,negative
larsons character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill,negative
this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters which really isnt enough to sustain it,negative
the films writer must have taken a cue from stephen king as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and geralds game,negative
larson and lebrock fight and torture each other the tables get turned a couple of times while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help,negative
some old guys around too just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film,negative
the old guy however miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous its worthy of a chuckle or two,negative
outside of that chuckle unfortunately tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors for some reason become increasing obnoxious,negative
if youre in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey dont,negative
make tracks to a far superior suspense film like misery,negative
the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into heartbreakers,negative
ray liottas character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office,negative
while scrambling to collect himself he frantically shouted to her just wait a sex er i mean sec,negative
i was struck by a wave of revulsion thinking geez didnt lines like that die when threes company was canceled,negative
over the next few minutes as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous i realized that the mindset behind heartbreakers predated threes company,negative
suddenly i had an outofbody experience as my internal wayback machine swept me to the mid1960s,negative
all across america the counterculture was growing like wildfire but there was scant evidence of it on tv,negative
while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special,negative
women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts,negative
on another channel dean martin made wisecracks about booze and broads and peter lawford decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket purred suggestive oneliners as he ogled the gogo dancers,negative
the adults laughed and laughed,negative
heartbreakers reeks of that stagnant mentality from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitts vahvahvoom breasts to its leaden screenplay which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sexobsessed to realize they are being manipulated,negative
in addition to liotta and hewitt the cast includes sigourney weaver gene hackman jason lee nora dunn and anne bancroft,negative
i cant imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project,negative
perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the 60s,negative
if so they were sadly mistaken,negative
the story revolves around a motherdaughter conteam,negative
it opens with the marriage of max weaver to dean liotta a new jersey chop shop operator,negative
having withheld sex until the honeymoon max pretends to pass out on their wedding night,negative
the next morning she feigns illness sending a very horny dean off to the office where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary,negative
just as the two are about to get overtly physical max bursts into the room and catches them,negative
the horrified bride dissolves the union garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way,negative
of course the secretary was really her daughter page hewitt and the whole thing was a setup,negative
the women move on but an irs agent bancroft catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes,negative
in desperate need of funds max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam,negative
their mark this time is william b tensy hackman in hideous makeup a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking,negative
max starts to put the game into action but page is so repelled by the old man and angry with her mom that she slips off to enact her own score targeting jack a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune,negative
complications arise when page realizes that goodnatured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart,negative
as if that wasnt enough dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind,negative
the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior a fish called wanda,negative
i wont bother to compare the two,negative
suffice to say that everything done right in wanda is done wrong here,negative
heartbreakers is soulless inept and at 123 minutes at least a halfhour too long,negative
sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters,negative
gene hackman is utterly wasted in a onenote onejoke part that has him doing nothing but smoking coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex,negative
poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland,negative
ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich but only a bit,negative
the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince while doing halfassed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue,negative
bear in mind though that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points,negative
if you remember bob hope specials with fondness this might be your cup of tea,negative
as for me im going to watch a fish called wanda now and try to forget i ever saw heartbreakers,negative
if you dont think kevin kline in drag is funny wait til you see will smith in dragits even less funny,negative
by the time jim west smith disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade artemus gordon kline from the clutches of evil dr loveless branagh i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld,negative
is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy anyway,negative
if your answer is no then you recall rustlers rhapsody or back to the future part iii if your answer is yes youre thinking of blazing saddles but that movie was a parody of the western genre not a nineteenth century romp,negative
1869 jim west is a quickdraw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon under orders from president grant kline again whose impression for all we know is deadon to apprehend legless loveless the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain,negative
how will loveless accomplish this,negative
well by hulking around the desert in an enormous mechanical tarantula of course,negative
bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar hayek whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless joins west and gordon on their gadgetfilled train,negative
gordon first discovers rita in a cage waiting to be rescued,negative
racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west despite the movies hip attitude toward the black thing,negative
west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a nigger before that person can finish speaking the word,negative
super,negative
at any rate i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous but shes a walking dressup toy,negative
her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peekaboo flap of her pyjamas,negative
jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith whose comic timing has always been hit or miss as episodes of the fresh prince of belair demonstrate,negative
smiths a better reactor than actor which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in blackhe didnt start out a hero,negative
in wild wild west hes required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time and from frame one a difficult feat im not sure any living performer could pull off,negative
smith is ill equipped for example to handle the moment in which jim west performs standup for some rednecks at his own hanging,negative
what attracted sonnenfeld to this material,negative
this isnt the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen the addams family anyone but its the first big stinker of his career as a director,negative
wild wild west is poorlypaced bombast full of doa gags ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambshes too intense to get an intentional laugh lousy special effects the bluescreening is amateurishforegrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds and frequent illogic,negative
to wit its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he drops,negative
him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic ugly henchmen instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula,negative
wild wild wests bright spots such as the cool opening credits sequence bai lings alltoobrief appearance as a femme fatale or the brilliant his masters voice joke are all part of the films first half which is more clever and enjoyable at least than its second,negative
when towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it there was a collective groan among audience members it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whizbang finale,negative
it rocksactually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film,negative
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they landonce in a while when we need a break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like,negative
nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur,negative
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon a steroid users answer to deep impact,negative
bruce willis stars as harry stamper a famed oildriller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet,negative
why an oil driller,negative
they require someone experience with deepcore mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid,negative
in one unintentionally,negative
hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect a deepcore driller they built based on his blueprints it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it,negative
we trust nasa to build space shuttles,negative
harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including a blond guy a fat guy a black guy a wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck,negative
once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes,negative
whether or not they save the day i will not reveal,negative
nor will you care,negative
i will say this you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope,negative
willis has barely a chance to come alive ditto for affleck,negative
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material,negative
steve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic,negative
rockhound as hes called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to a chair where he spends most of the film,negative
so why did they bring him up there to begin with,negative
rather why write him into the film give,negative
his almostwitty oneliners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig,negative
im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue,negative
liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her fathers bands aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack,negative
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie onscreen,negative
the middle hour is a nonsensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain,negative
whenever someone dies in this movie a crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead persons last name here,negative
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oilguycumastronaut from a live one and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood,negative
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla,negative
it looks nicer and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework,negative
it has a vivid soundmix,negative
but at almost twoandahalf hours i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story,negative
the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanicfever,negative
bollocks,negative
the lovers in the film are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a mooncrawler,negative
remember a little film called jaws,negative
in this film three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark,negative
they didnt much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another,negative
one of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories,negative
this is the sort of malebonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end,negative
not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesid be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called,negative
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery,negative
to this i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldnt build a birdhouse,negative
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life,negative
sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality,negative
he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict,negative
but in the same time almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumets reputation,negative
a stranger among us 1992 ripoff of peter weirs witness belongs to the latter category,negative
the heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york,negative
during one of such actions her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and as a result she becomes depressed,negative
in order to help her recover bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community,negative
emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder,negative
concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover,negative
that isnt easy because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways,negative
things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal,negative
using peter weirs formula isnt the greatest flaw of this film,negative
even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent,negative
but the worst insult to viewers audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith,negative
the author of this review never liked this actress very much but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles,negative
role of emily eden unfortunately isnt one of them,negative
first of all she cant pass for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isnt much better,negative
screenplay by robert j avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch,negative
but on the other hand other actors are more convincing lee richardson as an old rabbi thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community,negative
also the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture,negative
that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time,negative
this talky terriblyplotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux an exnew orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder mystery after a lightplane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat,negative
he and his wife annie kelly lynch rescue a little salvadorian girl samantha lagpacan from the wreckage and thats when the trouble begins,negative
the other major players include a local drug lord eric roberts his scheming wife teri hatcher a soused stripper mary stuart masterson and a shady dea agent vondie curtis hall,negative
everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective thats curious but never compelling,negative
based on the book by james lee burke heavens prisoners is so badly plotted that entire scenes seem to be missing,negative
early on we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves,negative
nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa,negative
later dave is reunited with a drugabuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation,negative
huh,negative
the whole movie is like this perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf,negative
whatever the reason somebody should tell director phil joanou final analysis to recut this mess,negative
in its present form heavens prisoners runs only two hours plus change but it feels like four,negative
the fab 4 of ronald reagan high are four stuckup girls played by rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart julie benz and charlotte roldan who overdress like 4 posh spice wannabes,negative
their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their makeup and powder their cheeks,negative
under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public,negative
in writer and director darren steins jawbreaker it isnt as funny as it sounds,negative
in fact it isnt funny at all,negative
stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence wit or charm,negative
his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they dont have time to add any emotion,negative
and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains,negative
the setup for the movie has one of the fab 4 liz who is referred to as the princess di of reagan high be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong,negative
the princess di reference is in bad taste as is much of the movie,negative
granted bad taste can sometimes be funny but the mere presence of bad taste doesnt guarantee it,negative
lizs girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth tape her mouth shut and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car,negative
when they open the trunk later liz is dead,negative
they eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape,negative
these realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer,negative
the films dialog not only isnt funny its trite,negative
one nerdy young girl introduces herself with my name is fern mayo as in hold the mayo,negative
when fern discovers what has happened the fab 3 make her an offer she cant refuse makeup,negative
they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan,negative
the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah,negative
the teachers fare no better especially in the ridiculous lines they are given,negative
miss shayne please cover your bosom one young teacher who has been made up to look old and ugly says without any conviction,negative
this is a learning institution not a brothel,negative
besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made there is one other question that id like to ask the director,negative
why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway,negative
in a cameo pam grier plays detective vera cruz who investigates lizs murder,negative
as she interrogates the other people she stares at them like they are all idiots proving that she is the only one that gets it,negative
i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie shed walk out after about 5 minutes and youd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it,negative
jawbreaker runs 1 27,negative
it is rated r for violence gore profanity and sex,negative
i would advise everyone to avoid it but if teenagers go they should be older and mature,negative
let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years,negative
i am not too fond of ted turners world championship wrestling however and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight,negative
the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs david arquette aptly cast as a neandrathal and sean dawkins scott caan who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show,negative
when they finally get to see their hero wcw world champion jimmy king played by oliver platt,negative
i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair a wasted palitaliano in a role originally meant for reallife wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back,negative
when they find him they discover in horror that jimmy kings real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv,negative
king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king,negative
after convincing king that they dont care that his persona isnt real gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcws payperview,negative
gee whiz there are so many things wrong with this movie i dont know where to begin,negative
yes i do,negative
1 the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff wcw president who thought up this project thinks of wrestling fans,negative
he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously,negative
he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously,negative
i got news for you eric nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that this is 2000 you know not 1985,negative
i know hell probably cover arguments up by saying it isnt meant to be taken seriously but it is because thats how big an ego bischoff has,negative
2 there was a documentary made in 1998 wrestling with shadows that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation vince mcmahons screwing bret the hitman hart out of the title,negative
this movies storyline is basically a comic ripoff of that plot with the poor mans wayne and garth thrown in,negative
eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart,negative
3,negative
the movies main wrestler jimmy king has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him,negative
no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age we want bad asses today,negative
4 why make this a comedy instead of an emotional rockystyle drama,negative
i know wrestling isnt a sport but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end,negative
5,negative
in the movie gordie starts up an illfated romance with nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan,negative
what she sees in that freak marilyn manson ill never understand only to find that she has hospitalized kings trainer for sinclair,negative
wouldnt it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spygirlforthebadguy cliche,negative
i hate that,negative
6,negative
last but certainly not least there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen nor did i laugh once either,negative
the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie for these reasons,negative
1 theyre the better promotion,negative
2 they have better and younger talent performers and wrestlers,negative
3,negative
they give their fans what they want and dont treat them like idiots,negative
4 theyre winning the ratings and theyre the promotion everybody cares about,negative
5 simply put they could make a movie a hundred times better and they could do a wrestling movie the right way,negative
the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end,negative
and if i spoiled it for you good i saved you from wasting seven dollars,negative
battlefield long boring and just plain stupid,negative
battlefield earth,negative
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman,negative
in my midteen years i had a horrendous reoccurring nightmare,negative
behind the wheel of a car i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert,negative
no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway,negative
no matter what i did the view didnt change travelling but not getting anywhere,negative
each time i awoke in a sweat terrified,negative
you dont have to be carl jung to understand that dream,negative
powerless to make changes trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake,negative
this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after battlefield earth begins,negative
for all of its flash and style l ron hubbards science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000,negative
dull and stupid,negative
in the year 3000 the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 000 years,negative
humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians,negative
theres no hope,negative
the future is bleak,negative
then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl john travolta and the alien race,negative
its an archetypal postapocalyptic plot full of promise,negative
considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen its difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably,negative
but it does,negative
the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits,negative
are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold the psychlo never discovered fort knox,negative
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time and gassed up,negative
or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships,negative
or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow dont notice that their slaves are missing for days,negative
travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all hes worth and is almost entertaining,negative
almost,negative
the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person mananimal or not would ever utter,negative
some of the film looks good but it also looks so familiar,negative
a race of large hulking apelike creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin,negative
sound like something charlton heston might be in,negative
the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from dune,negative
the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their hightech city is something george lucas might have been associated with,negative
its too loud,negative
its too oppressive,negative
its too slow,negative
its too long far,negative
too long,negative
and on it goes,negative
the list of the problems with battlefield earth is endless,negative
its difficult to find anything in the film that does work,negative
oh yeah,negative
the color scheme is nice,negative
the real question is how this movie ever got made,negative
could it have something to do with the fact that l ron hubbard was the founder of scientology,negative
and that john travolta is a member of the church,negative
that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago,negative
but it doesnt give us a clue as to why firsttime screenwriter corey mandells atrocious script was used,negative
or why the highprofile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film,negative
or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems,negative
the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costners the postman which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure be the big budget science fiction failure,negative
battlefield earth has the honor sewed up,negative
often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video,negative
thats not the case here,negative
you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one,negative
dont hesitate,negative
strike now while the iron is cold,negative
it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable,negative
the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed,negative
it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers james horner,negative
what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995,negative
what drags braveheart down is its screenplay,negative
it abounds with high production values john tolls awardwinning cinematography which also graced edward zwicks 1994 legends of the fall a gorgeous score by horner and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names,negative
but this does not save a misguided script,negative
the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero but the viewers only response to his heroism is intellectual william wallace producerdirector mel gibson is fighting for freedom and against tyranny so we have to root for him,negative
but wallaces actions paint a different story,negative
he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance,negative
though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king,negative
wallace speaks of freedom but his acts point toward vengeance,negative
after kicking the english out of scotland he decides to invade england,negative
this is evident of a spartacus complex and this example applies both historically and cinematically,negative
the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities the film spartacus like braveheart has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay,negative
it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film,negative
horners score tries to make emotional connection but the performances and the script do not help,negative
gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him,negative
this drags down any emotional connection to the films plot and turns three hours into a total waste of time,negative
based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers heyst william dafoe and alma irene jacob who seek refuge on heysts isolated island,negative
however their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones sam neil martin ricardo rufus sewell and their servant pedro graziano marcelli who have come to steal heysts rumoured plunder,negative
while the novel is largely complex in characterization the film sadly transposes conrads characters into lacklustre leads the most disappointing being heyst himself,negative
conrads heyst adheres religiously to his late fathers ways of detachment and isolation,negative
his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice,negative
the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude however is lost in mark peploes director and writer diluted version of heyst,negative
without properly establishing the crucial details of heysts character all that is left of conrads main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement,negative
on the one hand actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task though not impossible but on the other hand dafoes flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism,negative
in the end we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another,negative
the final transformation while perceptible lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrads novel,negative
its absence in the film is unforgivable,negative
the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers,negative
alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship namely heysts underlying philosophy of detachment which heyst himself grapples with,negative
the struggle against heysts ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of almas love for him,negative
jacob fairskinned gentle and yet passionate handles the role with precision detailing nuances where possible,negative
unfortunately she is let down by a superficial script,negative
the couples relationship develops too hastily leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant showandtell approach,negative
all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone,negative
this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions,negative
the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoes american accent an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london,negative
the other characters such as schomberg jean yanne the owner of a hotel and mr jones sam neill also fall short of conrads meticulous characterization,negative
while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma,negative
sam neils caricature of a slightly stout effeminate and softspoken gentlemanatlarge nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as an insolent spectre on leave from hades endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror,negative
poor characterization aside kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo secretary to mr jones a reckless ruffian capable of murder,negative
sewell with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity masterminding deceitful plans behind jones back,negative
at the same time we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans,negative
despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended,negative
sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic which is what victory deserves to be,negative
the delicately interwoven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production,negative
at the end of the film we are told that perhaps almas victory was in teaching heyst how to love,negative
a hollow victory indeed,negative
the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
plot two sister witches have to live with a curse placed upon their family which prevents them from ever enjoying a full life with a lover,negative
the hex invokes the eventual demise of their loved one,negative
when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma,negative
critique ive been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now but hold on to your brooms and incantations cause this puppy is far from being it,negative
for a film that has the word magic in its title this movie contains very few moments of magic or,negative
humor for that matter drama suspense or romance,negative
well actually there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled it never lets you in on whether its a comedy a drama a horror show or a murder mystery,negative
or maybe its a romance eh,negative
it doesnt really matter cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them or the film as a whole,negative
if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack this film mightve had a chance to be more than what it is now,negative
which is an unentertaining crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grabbag of stupid voiceovers overdone songs melodramatic romance undeveloped story and uneven acting,negative
i only wish that i could make that one hour and fortyfive minutes of my life reappear but alas it is lost in the spiritual world of interesting ideas gone wildly awry,negative
little known facts about this film and its stars this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman,negative
coscreenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997s batman robin,negative
director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours,negative
dirtywork has a premise of deliciously meanspirited potential,negative
mitch weaver norm macdonald and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna artie lange are losers in life they were constantly picked on in school and now they cannot hold regular jobs,negative
but as the trailer goes there is one thing mitch weaver is good atrevenge,negative
so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in gettingeven schemes into a marketable revengeforhire business called dirty work inc,negative
this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy but for a film called dirtywork what ensues is rather clean of spirit,negative
in fact what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine but rather a more sappy reason sams father jack warden needs a heart transplant and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list his compulsively betting doctor chevy chase asks the guys for 50 000 to pay off his bookie,negative
so for all the scheming that goes on beneath every underhanded plot isgasp a,negative
heart which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise,negative
not that there isnt a lot of nastiness on displaythere is but of a different sort,negative
there are frequent sexual references most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sams impotent fathers ongoing lust for them,negative
and for a film rated pg13 director bob saget yes that bob saget of fullhouse and americasfunniesthomevideos fame and writers frank sebastiano fred wolf and macdonald himself stretch the boundaries of good taste rather fararguably a bit too much so was not one but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary,negative
but the issue of course is not so much of taste as it is humoras in is it funny or not,negative
the answer is a resounding no,negative
its not that macdonald isnt a funny guy,negative
he was one of the more consistently funny performers on saturdaynightlive before his muchtalkedabout firing and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen it also doesnt hurt that hes a natural likable screen presence,negative
he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch but for the most part the oneliners as written are flat and the broad slapstick gags just dont work one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildingsa real riot,negative
still macdonalds few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has,negative
the late chris farley as hysterical as he ever was is amusing in a cameo role but as a whole the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance,negative
saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman adam sandler and john goodman but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent dirtywork from sputtering to the end of its brief 81minute running time,negative
the film closes on a sad note of desperation an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement,negative
come to think of it i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of dirtywork,negative
meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood,negative
screams the television ads for hanging up disastrously written by reallife sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton,negative
make me laugh again,negative
not only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two costars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they dont actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes,negative
and we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time,negative
excuse me again while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion,negative
eve marks meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with a husband adam arkin and preteen son jesse james,negative
her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in years has just recently been put into the hospital in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimers even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him,negative
while eves relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her children years ago she has had her fair share of ups and downs with lou who used to be an alcoholic,negative
her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the selftitled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest a soap opera actress,negative
interestingly their professions are given but we not once ever see them working at their jobs or for that matter learn much of anything about them,negative
maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another,negative
and they talk,negative
and talk,negative
and talk,negative
in fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long,negative
if you are able to get through the opening halfhour in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest,negative
the question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating selfinvolved patontheback,negative
how could a comedydrama that has the starpower of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways,negative
issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isnt mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought,negative
also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes,negative
and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying threeminute scene in which they argue like little children,negative
you can see the impending death coming a mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves and with each other,negative
you think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have a playful foodfight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credits,negative
meg ryan is a versatile actress look no further than 1998s hurlyburly or 1994s when a man loves a woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies,negative
with hanging up the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron a hack who shouldnt be allowed to work in hollywood again after this bigbudget highprofile debacle,negative
even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks to christmas 1988 when she had a heartbreaking runin with her mother and to halloween 1993 when lou crashed her sons birthday party in a drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations,negative
diane keaton as georgia is better as an actress than a director here but that is a wildly feeble compliment,negative
what is more than a little farfetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children she is no more than five years ryans senior,negative
yeah right,negative
lastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a bigscreen venture after her even more thin role in 1999s analyze this,negative
kudrow isnt given enough time to create a full personality with maddy so it isnt her fault she doesnt register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue,negative
if anything though kudrow is a real talent and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time as in her brilliantly nuanced oscarcaliber work in 1998s the opposite of sex,negative
if you are a fan of kudrows and who isnt do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than hanging up does in its entirety,negative
as eves hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do until a subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again,negative
cloris leachman as with ryan and matthau makes a small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg as a rosycheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production,negative
nearly all the emotions displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats,negative
if for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over,negative
saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions,negative
a life less ordinary r while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided for this confused confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle producer andrew macdonald and screenwriter john hodge,negative
at the core of this strange film is a fairly basicand yes ordinarypremise,negative
after robert boyle regular ewan mcgregor an aspiring writer of trashy novels is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation he kidnaps navilles ian holm spoiled daughter celine cameron diaz and holds her for ransom,negative
the joke here is that celine is a willing victimher father threatened to cut her off financially so she wants revengeand that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping,negative
and ultimately didnt we see this one coming,negative
love,negative
so far so mediocre,negative
but mediocre is better than dreadful which this film is thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance,negative
it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth so the chief of heavens police gabriel dan hedaya dispatches two angels oreilly holly hunter and jackson delroy lindo to earth to hook up celine and robertor lose their angel status,negative
this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture,negative
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film as it stands it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand,negative
not that there is much of a romance to begin with,negative
try as diaz and mcgregor may celine and robert are too onenote to become very endearing characters,negative
celine is rich bitch robert is a dullard,negative
as such it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these twothen again they never seem to really connect with each other,negative
when celine and robert start to overtly act on their feelings it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural,negative
but i am not exactly sure if boyle and companys point was romance honestly i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish,negative
boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz but it remains just thatenergy not energy in service of a story or even acting,negative
the cast seems lost especially hunter whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling,negative
and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film some violent confrontations involving the angels who are not exactly angelicin fact they end up staging their own ransom scheme some mystical hokum in the climax and a cutesy claymation epilogue,negative
watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell stockpiling quirks in the name of cool,negative
instead the film just gives quirky a bad name,negative
my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic yes misspelling intended whimsy which comes through in only one scene an extended musical number where celine and robert sing beyond the sea at a karaoke bar,negative
after a verse or two the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter,negative
the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard just relying on the innate charm of the leads allowing them to build a romantic rapport,negative
alas not nearly enough is built for this moment comes to an abrupt end,negative
i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill,negative
a life less ordinary certainly delivers something different but by the time the film was over i was clamoring for a life more ordinary,negative
i can accept failure,negative
everyone fails at something,negative
but i cant accept not trying,negative
it doesnt matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart,negative
michael jordan,negative
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla,negative
his entrance however is a grand one out from the trees he leaps gargantuan and imposing sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have,negative
joe bellows at the poachers before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars,negative
during this scene i turned to my friend and said wow,negative
thats some ape,negative
joe is quite a gorilla a big digital gorilla,negative
he runs around the fields chasing cars and people,negative
he picks things up and stares at them pensively,negative
he breaks things on accident because hes just too big to avoid clumsiness,negative
joe as a special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes,negative
as a character he doesnt quite register,negative
and the story hes been put in is as limp as they come,negative
the words family entertainment have never been a stamp of quality but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart,negative
the picture is a remake of the 1949 film,negative
its mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly as a formality the movie also has a few human characters,negative
the main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent a lover of gorillas,negative
as a child she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother now she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife,negative
specifically shes out to protect joe a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood,negative
soon zoologist gregg ohara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jills mother,negative
so in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers,negative
in addition the space is way too small for him after all he is a really big gorilla,negative
and to add to the complications strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jills mother,negative
jill of course doesnt recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother,negative
this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film,negative
the movie isnt really offensive it has some competent actors a few nifty sets and a lot of scenes with a big digitized gorilla,negative
but the story is really dumb there arent any characters and the film isnt satisfying on any level beyond its visuals,negative
the movie also has bad dialogue,negative
if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue its only fair to quote some of it but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like joe isnt happy,negative
and joe isnt safe here,negative
we need to get joe out of here,negative
joe is way too big for that cage,negative
i dont know if these phrases are word for word but theyre close,negative
as i said the characters here are only present as a formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage,negative
paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them,negative
sadly mighty joe young wastes them both,negative
there are a few clever moments although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and as i said the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes,negative
its certainly not a bad film for kids i doubt joe will give them nightmares,negative
but adults in the audience arent likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla,negative
a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while after that something needs to be done with the big gorilla,negative
nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla,negative
its now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james jennifer love hewitt best friends,negative
still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown,negative
she cant concentrate on her schoolwork cant get a good nights sleep and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club,negative
everywhere she looks she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand,negative
in the first movie i know what you did last summer julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway,negative
to cover their misdeed they dump the body into the ocean,negative
however he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends,negative
julie and one other ray freddie prinze jr survived only to make this dismal sequal,negative
needing some desparate rest and relaxation she is elated to learn that her college roommate karla brandy has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island,negative
accompanying these two girls are karlas overbearing boyfriend tyrell mehki phifer and a potential beau for julie,negative
but was this contest too good to be true,negative
the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects,negative
meanwhile the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin,negative
this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island,negative
eventually they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms,negative
as you might have guessed somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook,negative
julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island an eerie touch is when she is singing i will survive at the karaoke bar and the words scroll i still know but her friends chalk it up to paranoia,negative
but the body count soon starts to rise and for julie its going to be the worst vacation of her life,negative
the funny yes i used the word funny thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling maybe it was my giggling than i heard screaming,negative
this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness,negative
there isnt even any suspense that leads up to the deaths,negative
heres an appropriate example,negative
knockknock,negative
housekeeping says the diminuitive cleaning lady,negative
the door suddenly opens up,negative
slash,negative
next victim,negative
is there any reason to go and see this movie,negative
not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes,negative
but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me,negative
i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido,negative
i secretly wished for him to get filleted,negative
did he get hooked,negative
well lets just say that if he didnt i would give this film a grade of d,negative
part buddy comedy part fishoutofwater story part nature tale meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes,negative
in fact it is an invitation you ought to disregard,negative
phil and stew deedle paul walker and steve van wormer are the twin sons of the famous millionaire elton deedle eric braeden founder of deedle enterprises,negative
elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune instead,negative
the two are careless hawaiian surf bums,negative
to set them straight he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp to which the pair inevitably go,negative
after several misadventures in wyoming where the duo is stunned to discover theres no surf the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot,negative
they arrive at yellowstone national park where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits,negative
rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad the deedles play along,negative
phil actually has other motives the beautiful park ranger jesse a,negative
j langer who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine john ashton,negative
yellowstone has a problem,negative
its only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs,negative
not just one or two thousands of them,negative
the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p dog menace not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater dennis hopper,negative
the brothers deedle arent supposed to be outandout stupid like the team from dumb and dumber or bill and ted,negative
instead their brains just operate in a different simpler realm,negative
a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board a film which unfortunately this one resembles in several hideous ways,negative
the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isnt funny,negative
theres a moment when phil utters the line insert laugh here which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience,negative
the result isnt bad in a runshriekingfromthetheater type of way,negative
instead its merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way,negative
the cast seems decent but theyre never asked to do anything remotely interesting,negative
instead the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people cars rolling downhill in the forest and with constant annoying references to other disney films,negative
youll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles,negative
the bachelor is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see,negative
wading through this gooey detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic,negative
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris odonnell vehicle should wander elsewhere the bachelor is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy,negative
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money,negative
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical prettyboy cocoon chris odonnell has an effortless charm as an actor,negative
most will recognize him as the highflying robin from the two latest batman films but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile,negative
can odonnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders,negative
perhaps if he found the proper vehicle,negative
but the bachelor falls far short of the requirements,negative
the actor just cant register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success,negative
a few instances of adorable humor aside it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is the bachelor,negative
odonnell plays jimmie a hopeless romantic in his late twenties whos progressing in a serious relationship with anne renee zellweger,negative
jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage,negative
the problem is that his proposal sucks,negative
big time,negative
you can tell things arent going pleasantly because jimmie gets the infamous deerintheheadlights look when anne questions his approach,negative
and then the plot along with the stupidity of the movie thickens,negative
jimmies grandfather peter ustinov dies suddenly leaving a video will behind for his grandson who also happens to be his only living relative,negative
everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie,negative
of course theres a catch he must get married before his 30th birthday stay joined with his bride for an entire decade and produce healthy children within the first five years,negative
the bad news is that jimmies birthday is the following day,negative
with anne out of town he must find a willing bride to share his riches with,negative
and within a very limited time frame,negative
there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of the bachelor,negative
for one the movies approach is interesting and not dripping with clich,negative
another is the colorful cast,negative
odonnell and zellweger are cute together and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in its own mediocrity,negative
ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmies marital adventures,negative
and now the cons the approach may be interesting but in trying an oldfashioned method director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel,negative
the characters are drawn with obvious broad strokes and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable,negative
yes the bachelor is far more frustrating than cute,negative
the screenplay is lamely written and the subject matter poorly conceived,negative
the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted along with whatever promise the film initially contained,negative
potential goes out the window early to suit sinyors colorful approach but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the directors wishes,negative
the bachelor becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it,negative
youve seen the tv spots havent you,negative
odonnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads what is this man running from,negative
in actuality hes fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune its one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film,negative
after seeing the movie i believe that the approaching horde could be something else,negative
odonnell could be running from his angry fans who have just endured the bachelor and are hunting him down for revenge,negative
forget get carter,negative
instead,negative
get me a cup of coffee,negative
what the hell has happened to all good american action movies,negative
did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere,negative
when did all of the badass kicking butt and taking names guntoting crazed vengeful characters of the 1980s from such films as commando cobra predator raw deal first blood suddenly turn into innocent compassionate sensitive tearyeyed knuckleheads,negative
the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east and i dont mean new york city,negative
get carter the latest masterpiece from uberthespian sylvester stallone is a prime example of large and in charge 80s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown,negative
stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up,negative
a few years ago stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey,negative
that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland a strange film about redemption within a broken soul,negative
stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past,negative
too bad get carter returns stallone to action but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges,negative
get carter is a simple story,negative
stallone plays frank carter a vegas bruiser for a loan shark played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore,negative
when franks brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident frank feeling all guilty and mushy inside thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented carters way,negative
he talks tough with his brothers wife lends a helping had to his brothers daughter doreen rachel leigh cook and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee,negative
carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultracool mcqueenesque mickey rourke a multimillionaire computer geek alan cumming and a strange foreign guy michael caine who speaks in riddles and talks tough,negative
carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties,negative
what a minute,negative
this sounds just like another film i saw last year the limey,negative
better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off,negative
actually get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name starring caine in the title role and what with his cameo here the cleverness is astonishing,negative
while stallone still carries his own weight here the movie lacks what the original did as well purpose,negative
throughout the film stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough while nobody is taking him seriously,negative
his oneliners fall flat and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions mental and physical required of his character,negative
there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations in both fists and words,negative
the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke,negative
an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs spousal abuse a boxing career and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character,negative
he may not win any oscars but he still ranks highly in my book,negative
get carter has great directing strong acting by rourke and caine and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud,negative
the only thing it lacks as with most hollywood productions is a good script and proper casting,negative
never mind that it should never have been made at all,negative
synopsis wealthy cuban landowner luis banderas gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride,negative
not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia jolie she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit,negative
soon julia has absconded with both luis fortune and his heart and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld luis begins to realise that for him there is no turning back,negative
review given the absurdism of its wouldbe plot its unlikely that original sin could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking regardless of writer director or stars,negative
this is at its heart bmovie junk a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions,negative
that said original sin could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it,negative
instead cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production and directs it as such,negative
the result is a vapid uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill,negative
consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie brightlylit and mostly filmed from above it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show,negative
cristofer doesnt even manage to capture the allure of cuba instead of portraying his setting as a steamy sensuous island paradise it appears bland and lifeless,negative
at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script but arent being given the chance,negative
the same cannot be said of jane whose billy is nebbish and transparent,negative
also unwise is the jolie framing sequence which practically gives away the films denouement,negative
it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of its stars roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70,negative
mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films,negative
fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles,negative
this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was,negative
william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us,negative
at least in the movies anyway,negative
it has been several years since charlie brewster ragsdale and bmovie actor turned late night horror film host peter vincent mcdowall came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlies next door neighbor,negative
charlie and peter won that battle but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family,negative
apparently charlies former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling,negative
so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge,negative
this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again,negative
one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlies stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood,negative
fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort,negative
while they are stylish the vamps in this film just dont have the personality of the undead in the first film,negative
with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes,negative
one bright spot speaking from a strictly sexist point of view is traci lin who plays charlies very skeptical girlfriend,negative
its really a shame that her career hasnt been better since she made this film,negative
ragsdale does a fair job in this film but doesnt give nearly the performance that he did in the original,negative
roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given which unfortunately isnt much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie,negative
i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way,negative
the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner part 2 had more of the feel of a music video,negative
never a good thing for a horror film,negative
another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare,negative
for that matter they were almost nonexistent,negative
if i was going to watch a horror film this would be far from my first choice,negative
the first fright night on the other hand would be right up near the top of my list,negative
if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film id probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes,negative
either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation,negative
numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past scifi suspense thrillers,negative
soldier is a multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring,negative
the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground,negative
besides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age,negative
the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography,negative
russell who is usually a good actor in bgrade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like a sergeant toad,negative
besides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombielike which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience,negative
this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth,negative
although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still a long way from anything considered desirable,negative
synopsis when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert community college professors ira kane duchovny and harry block jones are first on the scene,negative
they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate,negative
soon the army advised by dr allison reed moore moves in and forces kane and block out,negative
but when the aliens begin to menace society it may take the scientists combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform humanity,negative
review evolution certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy,negative
its directed by reitman clearly trying to parlay his ghostbusters success into a twentyfirstcentury counterpart,negative
it stars duchovny and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his xfiles character so soon after leaving the tv series it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition,negative
and then theres moore who may not have much prior experience in comedy but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress,negative
a shame then that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass,negative
evolution is a movie more concerned with its special effects which are quite good than anything resembling a consistently funny script,negative
it has its moments a scene in which jones body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour,negative
moore is totally wasted her clumsy shtick getting very old very fast,negative
duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with,negative
and the story is so formulaic it could have been written by monkeys,negative
part of what made ghostbusters so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for,negative
evolution is so mindnumbingly tedious that its difficult not to start cheering for the aliens,negative
this is one of the worst bigscreen film experiences ive had for a while,negative
with this film plus showgirls and basic instinct paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors,negative
his celebrated film total recall was i admit successfully scripted but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws,negative
obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven the result being that much of the special effects in starship seemed fake,negative
but not everything bad in the film was the directors fault even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors,negative
it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards i expected five for the acting categories,negative
casserole vanity devoid dense ribald dingy miasma and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school,negative
no they have to pass primary school drama classes first,negative
while total was written well starship is purely pathetic,negative
all right it is supposed to be a fastpaced entertainment film and youre supposed to turn off your intellect completely and enjoy the action sequences and special effects that is guts and gore,negative
as a matter of fact i found the activity incredibly boring a complete waste of more than two hours,negative
half of the film was a bad episode of beverly hills 90210 dina meyer was in beverly hills while another quarter was simply nothing things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web and the rest was a display of humans fighting computergenerated images,negative
the battles were all the same jumping around shoot or get stabbed and on barren planets that only had giant insects,negative
there werent even any stunts which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around,negative
i wonder what the insects eat if theres nothing but them on the planets,negative
there is so much laughable treatment in this film and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended,negative
this type of story is obviously aimed at 10yearolds who cant see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality,negative
but then there are always 16yearolds who have that frame of mind,negative
the pointless plot begins when johnnys vanity devoid girlfriend carmen richards decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth,negative
johnny then signs up as a trooper also after an overacted argument with his parents,negative
but there is another girl dizzy meyer who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen which results in a love quadrangle which isnt better because it means augmented worsethanstereotyped soap opera increased bitchiness and more bad beverly hills melrose,negative
and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid,negative
anyway getting back to the thing you might call plot johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry while his girl and the other dude are in the same league,negative
dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also,negative
they then start training which contains what roger ebert calls ips idiot plot syndrome moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes then real combat,negative
and guess what,negative
thats about as complex as it gets,negative
oh and one of their friends carl neil patrick harris a k a doogie howser m d becomes involved in war intelligence and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it,negative
hes my fifth nom for a razzie,negative
the troopers fight fall in love die kill and try to act,negative
naturally they win or sort of halfwin,negative
of course in between and at the end there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs,negative
the bugs also suffer from ips why would you release hold of your captive before killing it,negative
isnt it also amazing that earthlings havent invented better handheld weapons by then,negative
the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero,negative
well maybe aquarter of a star for the originality of the cosex shower scene and the very brief moments of suspense another quarter for copying zulu and letting the good guys the bugs win and half a star for the suckingout of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors but there should have been more the troopers deserved to die,negative
this movie stinks,negative
although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss,negative
i knew i was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see a detailed closeup of warrant officer paul brenners john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color,negative
this might seem like a minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow,negative
and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training,negative
or what about when brenner tells a suspect that because he is in the military he doesnt have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision,negative
how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts,negative
now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through,negative
for example at the beginning of the film paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into a gun and knife battle at his offpost houseboat and windsup killing an arms dealer he had been investigating,negative
the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing,negative
but instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him,negative
duh,negative
ultimately brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding generals daughter a young captain also assigned to the post,negative
when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the generals daughter does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects,negative
no his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing,negative
eventually brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier,negative
i wont even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the armys suppression of this horrendous crime,negative
i will just mention one final flaw,negative
brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia,negative
the rape occurred in west point which is in new york,negative
he is under a very tight and totally implausible 36hour deadline to solve this case,negative
he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point,negative
does he phone the doctor,negative
no he travels via some unexplained very fast transport to new york to question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns to georgia again by the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline,negative
you have been warned stay away from this one,negative
fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade,negative
tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies but the quantity,negative
most of those movies were produced by cannon group company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus,negative
those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman b movie mentors of future hollywood legends,negative
unfortunately that didnt happened and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal,negative
sadly for bronson that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead and lowering his own reputation in process,negative
on the other hand bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself,negative
one of such movies that seriously marred bronsons reputation is death wish 3 third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974,negative
in the original movie bronson played paul kersey mildmannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence,negative
that movie was far from masterpiece yet in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry,negative
unfortunately six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels even the presence of its original director didnt stop the rapid decline of the quality,negative
death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend living in the urban wasteland of east new york populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out,negative
before the reunion kerseys friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker played by gavan oherlihy probably the only noteworthy role in the film,negative
kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade while the police inspector shriker ed lauter ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime,negative
bronson the main asset in this movie plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine,negative
although bronsons charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower the lack of emotions or bronsons own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film,negative
the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness so they added romantic interest for their hero public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kerseys crusade,negative
on the other hand emotions are much better played by confronting lawabiding yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey,negative
unfortunately michael winner doesnt know how to work out the plot and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations ends this movie with a bang,negative
the big showdown at the end that turns east new york into the sarajevolike battle zone is probably the worst part of the movie because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget,negative
in short this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia,negative
special note for trekkies marina sirtis the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife,negative
attention moviegoers you are about to enter a meaningfree zone,negative
should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes do not panic,negative
the film will work just as well as a silent movie,negative
chronicling the meaningless lives of vain yuppie types the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films last days of disco barcelona and metropolitan but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing,negative
firsttime writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth,negative
there isnt one of these characters worth caring about,negative
the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of people magazine,negative
among others the movie features ben affleck casey affleck david chappelle janeane garofalo gaby hoffmann catherine kellner courtney love jay mohr martha plimpton christina ricci and paul rudd,negative
and unlike people magazine the people speak not that they have anything interesting to say,negative
its new years eve in 1981 and monica martha plimpton is preparing her big party,negative
structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars,negative
monicas apartment is in noho an area that one of the guests describes as so cool all of the poor people live there,negative
typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin paul rudd and his friend and wouldbe sexual partner lucy courtney love,negative
they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone except him of course,negative
she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her which turns out to be neither erotic funny or successful rather like the rest of the story,negative
the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new years eve birthday,negative
cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie,negative
another character played by jay mohr has a problem with his sexual triumphs,negative
every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning,negative
when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him his response is i like a lot of people,negative
as the movie finally draws to a close the characters awaken from their postparty game of musical beds,negative
some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little while others actually have some clue as to what happened,negative
the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie,negative
200 cigarettes runs 1 40,negative
it is rated r for profanity sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers,negative
every now and then reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed,negative
most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact either good or bad that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings,negative
but sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons,negative
i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review,negative
the impression left by the film wasnt overwhelming on the contrary there were hardly any impression at all since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it,negative
which surprise me to this day because the movie theatre was full i was close to sound speakers the show wasnt late and i didnt lack sleep before the show,negative
such things happen very rarely to me and after many years the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself,negative
the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters old peter brackett nick nolte and young aspiring sabrina peterson julia roberts,negative
two of them are assigned to cover the train collision,negative
as soon as they meet they start scooping each other but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk and also the romantic feelings they have for each other,negative
the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d tre romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn,negative
movie author director and screenwriter charles shyer who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride tries again this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts,negative
however although there is some chemistry between the two soon it stops to arouse any interest,negative
it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix that collides lighthearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers,negative
shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two and fails in both areas making the story cliched and predictable,negative
the end result is rather forgettable effort which convinced me not to watch movie again,negative
ill give it the benefit of the doubt though,negative
when walt disney pictures announced a liveaction feature based on the 60s cartoon series of mr magoo special interests groups representing the visionimpaired let out a cry of dismay,negative
mr,negative
magoo they claimed would be an insult to the men and women they represented,negative
in fact they were wrong,negative
mr,negative
magoo is not just an insult to the blind and nearblind its an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny 90 minute atrocity,negative
its stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas,negative
look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases and youll see a shocking list of retreads including 101 dalmatians george of the jungle jungle2jungle that darn cat flubber and now mr,negative
magoo,negative
the best of these george of the jungle was mildly entertaining,negative
the worst mr,negative
magoo exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be,negative
the first problem with mr,negative
magoo is the script,negative
despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft mr,negative
magoo is comically barren,negative
from beginning to end theres not a laugh to be found,negative
every attempt at humor and there are lots of them falls flat with an audible thud,negative
youd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film at least a few would work but thats not the case,negative
ive had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures,negative
then theres leslie nielsen who looks sounds and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character memorably voiced by jim backus,negative
in the past nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun,negative
lately however he has been getting lazy taking parts in the likes of dracula dead and loving it spy hard and mr,negative
magoo,negative
even if nielsen was in top form it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo especially since were reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film but top form is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here,negative
this is strictly a takethemoneyand run operation,negative
the story which like many disney stories can be described in one long sentence magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum and as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own the police mistake him for the robber,negative
the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky who take their lumps early and often,negative
the bad guys are kelly lynch who does a lot of martial artstype kicking nick chinlund and malcolm mcdowell who has the good sense to look embarrassed,negative
matt keeslar portrays one of magoos sidekicks his nephew waldo,negative
the bumbling mans other more interesting companion is a dog named angus,negative
most of mr,negative
magoos humor comes in the form of failed slapstick,negative
the cartoon violence level in this film doesnt approach that of home alone 3 or flubber but its still pretty acute with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices,negative
theres a nonviolent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better but compared to mr beans recent similar misadventure it doesnt hold up well,negative
then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoos near blindness such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby,negative
im willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack,negative
tong a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market has helmed several jackie chan movies including first strike rumble in the bronx and supercop,negative
his chief talent that of choreographing martial arts fights is wasted here despite some high kicking by kelly lynch,negative
like john woo hard target and ringo lam maximum risk before him it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream,negative
it is worth noting that unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under10 crowd while driving parents to distraction mr,negative
magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages,negative
the screening i attended was walltowall kids and for the most part they didnt seem to be enjoying themselves,negative
when the film was over i asked one little girl what she thought of it,negative
her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words,negative
mr,negative
magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer sight unseen,negative
five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there is this starting to sound familiar by mistake,negative
the girls accidentlly open the box big surprise huh and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one betcha didnt see that one coming,negative
hard to die i found out while watching the film is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 nightie nightmare r a m r,negative
1521,negative
two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film robyn harris and melissa moore but they play different characters here,negative
orville ketchum is also back as get ready for this orville ketchum yes the same character from number two,negative
yes he is also built like a tank in this film too,negative
im telling you a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldnt harm him at all,negative
the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act well they seemed to have lost that ability,negative
thankfully for my sanity i also saw the film warlock which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film,negative
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks,negative
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line,negative
the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out analyzed and discarded before it happens,negative
there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot,negative
while we are on the subject of the story the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress,negative
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the managers office,negative
im sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary ridiculous and hurts the story more if that is still possible,negative
the script for this film is completely pathetic,negative
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible,negative
the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along,negative
here is an example of the wonderful dialog,negative
the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a really big gun,negative
the line is my dad used to be a marine i bet i can work it,negative
this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy,negative
now we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan has been presented,negative
one comment from an actress is not a lot of strategy involved but i like it,negative
im afraid folks that this is about as good as they get,negative
now lets talk about the great special effects for this film,negative
this obviously wasnt a big concern of the film makers,negative
the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewers intelligence,negative
a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie,negative
are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get,negative
the continuity department was obviously asleep along with the viewers when watching this film,negative
in one shot actress has cloths on camera angle changes actress seems to have lost clothing,negative
very impressive trick,negative
the one half,negative
plus that this film has going for it is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious,negative
the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny and so the viewer can get some enjoyment from the film,negative
however this doesnt make it worth the rental fee of over a penny,negative
in the acting department the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down,negative
i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least,negative
oh well win some lose some,negative
has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plotdriven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs,negative
in enemy of the state that is exactly right,negative
a few parts the net and a few parts conspiracy theory enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997s lame brained men in black,negative
will this guy ever get a real role,negative
he has the bruce willis syndrome,negative
the plot is bascially smith playing a lawyer getting into hot water with some high government murderers who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie when a tape of the killing gets into his hands,negative
he inlists the help of an old conspirator hackman and at the end er you,negative
know,negative
enemy was one of the worst films of last year,negative
not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven and i didnt like how smith always magically outsmarted the badies when all the other extra characters seeming more intelligent than smith somehow got run over by a truck,negative
enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek insurrection,negative
i know these two films are different in well everything but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me,negative
somehow quality cant overshadow quantity,negative
capsule a science fiction allegory,negative
at the millennium a lethal contagious virus has hit taiwan,negative
officials have cut off water and other services to the center of contagion,negative
life there devolves and degenerates,negative
a man in an apartment has a hole in his floor and with it harasses his downstairs neighbor,negative
a slow but harrowing film to be missed if possible,negative
low 1 4 to 4,negative
the taiwan virus is ravaging taiwan and the part of the city that is the center of the contagion has been evacuated of anyone who will go,negative
one apartment building still houses people,negative
a woman formerly an office worker yang kueimei is tormented by her upstairs neighbor lee kangsheng who has a hole cut by a plumber in the floor and is using it as a drain,negative
neighbor runs a small failing grocery store,negative
to make things more depressing it is constantly raining hard,negative
upstairs neighbor vomits through pours water etc a small and almost entirely onesided war starts,negative
allegory about callousness and selfishness,negative
woman is living on a pile of rolls of toilet tissue,negative
incongruous songs added to show downstairs neighbors dreams,negative
these are the songs of popular taiwanese singer grace chang,negative
apartment is falling apart,negative
wallpaper is separating from walls,negative
plumbing is failing,negative
boredom shown by long cuts in which nothing happens,negative
a lot of film seems to be used up,negative
this story might have been done much better as a tenminute animated film,negative
stars are considered to be great dramatic actors by one reviewer,negative
this film seems longer at 95 minutes most twohour films,negative
martial arts master steven seagal not to mention director has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in a hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger,negative
hes also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck,negative
they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art,negative
im sure the guys good and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows although a tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same a guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although i kinda liked under siege,negative
of course this one as a change has a message that is drilled into our mind of,negative
course after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people,negative
so why do i watch his crap,negative
i usually dont,negative
i will never and you can hold me to this i will never pay to see this mans movies unless and only unless hes in a supporting role i e,negative
executive decision and id definitely pay if he dies i e,negative
executive decision,negative
but this one has a special place in my heart,negative
this doesnt mean its good or that i even liked it,negative
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la mystery science theatre 3000 and this was a couple years before i had heard of mystery science theatre 3000,negative
in this one seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greasedup typical shallow villain this time played by an oscarwinner to give the movie some more clout michael caine,negative
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land,negative
around the 2030 minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off or,negative
does he,negative
seagal is rescued by some inuits and falls in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here,negative
one of caines cliched henchmen played here with a lot of overacting by john c mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory literally,negative
of course,negative
at one point seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesnt have any options but blow stuff up,negative
he even goes as far as to say i dont want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is,negative
i have no problem with violence,negative
im a huge john woo fan but he paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence,negative
in the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them,negative
at some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying a corny line to which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them and does,negative
this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didnt take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summers con air,negative
but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message,negative
i wouldnt mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence,negative
but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewers mind,negative
the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we cant take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job,negative
then at the end he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech just in case you didnt get the message from the trailers,negative
what seagal doesnt realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe a couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but doesnt comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish,negative
as far as seagal and his acting hes rather boring,negative
he squints he kills,negative
period,negative
nothing else,negative
oh yeah theres corny oneliners im gonna reach out and touch someone,negative
of course hes the star and were supposed to root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks,negative
michael caine whos a great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold,negative
he does it well i guess but this is no alfie,negative
of coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him,negative
his big henchman john c mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible,negative
and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid r lee ermey from full metal jacket as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagals ego,negative
and also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermeys assasins,negative
anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagals movies is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really a seagal movie,negative
they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes it more excrucitating to watch,negative
i mean if you do rent it and i dont reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes,negative
but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one,negative
my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock,negative
its time to take cover,negative
after a hiatus of about fifteen years the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest,negative
in early 1997 there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone one on television and two in the theaters with dantes peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar,negative
of the two i had heard that dantes peak was the better film so i decided to check it out when it was released on video,negative
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town,negative
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption,negative
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky crushing homes and people,negative
we see people panicking people crying and even horses rearing,negative
it is a disaster of biblical proportions signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road,negative
symbolism doesnt get much more blatant than that,negative
we learn that harry dalton pierce brosnan a volcanologist with the u s geological survey was there with his wife when the eruption occurred,negative
harry survived but his wife did not,negative
a few years later harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dantes peak washington which we are told has been voted second most desirable place to live under 20 000 by the readers of money magazine,negative
there harry meets rachel wando a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dantes peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop,negative
although the mayor doesnt seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up a few members of the city council are,negative
they are afraid that harrys presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dantes peak,negative
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug,negative
however when an amorous young couple takes a skinnydip in the local hot springs they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath,negative
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption,negative
this film contains a number of cliches,negative
the amorous couple is one,negative
as soon as they doff their clothes you know theyre going to die,negative
the town busybody and the abrasive motherinlaw make appearances as does the deathdefying dog,negative
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable,negative
watching the movie i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements but some of the dialogue as well,negative
unfortunate since much of the dialog is terrible,negative
for example harrys boss paul charles hallahan and a team from the u s geological survey join harry to assess the situation,negative
paul basically tells the townsfolk that harrys eruption predictions arent cause for alarm,negative
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage only to turn up the next day ready for work,negative
when paul asks harry why he stayed he says with grim determination cause this towns in trouble and im the best man youve got,negative
even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving,negative
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water,negative
if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up however the frog wont move and will allow itself to be cooked,negative
is that your recipe for frog soup,negative
asks one of the team members,negative
its my recipe for disaster responds harry,negative
dantes peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious,negative
our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid,negative
mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming in a very grave tone acid eats metal,negative
thanks for the tip,negative
when we first see the u s geological survey building theres a caption labeling it as such,negative
this wouldnt have been so bad if it werent for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads in large letters u s geological survey,negative
i suppose the caption is for people who cant read signs,negative
although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film the viewer has no idea why,negative
there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters and the relationship seems rushed because of this,negative
when they get close to kissing i was asking myself why do they want to kiss,negative
were they even attracted to each other,negative
if i were the mayor i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesnt even crack a smile through the whole movie trying to pull off the roughyetdebonair act,negative
who does he think he is,negative
james bond,negative
the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed,negative
there are several warning signs prior to the eruption itself but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we dont feel as if they are leading up to anything,negative
for example one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot,negative
a tremor occurs,negative
does he plunge headlong to his death,negative
is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below,negative
no a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg,negative
the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well,negative
it wasnt,negative
one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dantes peak,negative
in a disaster movie theres usually one guy whos greedy enough to cover up the possibility of meteorite and usually gets killed by the disaster,negative
its okay of course because we all think he got what he deserved,negative
if youre going to be unoriginal you might as well go all the way,negative
in dantes peak the city councilmembers are concerned but they dont really try hard enough,negative
maybe the mayors abrasive motherinlaw should have been the one,negative
for no apparent reason she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt,negative
perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate,negative
there are a couple of good things about this movie,negative
the first is the scenery,negative
there are panoramic shots of forests lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful,negative
the second is the special effects,negative
they are the closest ive ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption,negative
but when elements which dont speak are going to be the best parts of your movie youd probably better rewrite the script,negative
my first press screening of 1998 and already ive gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list,negative
what an auspicious beginning,negative
welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l a and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere,negative
firestorm the directorial debut of dances with wolvess academy award winning cinematographer dean semler is the first of the new years crop of movies,negative
as our story opens the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are smokejumpers,negative
we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl where one of the gungho guys is taking a romance quiz from cosmopolitan,negative
having the time of their lives they then jump into the middle of a burning forest,negative
when even in the beginning the director cant get the small parts right you can sense the movie is in trouble,negative
with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasolinefilled cars smokejumper monica christianne hirt tells them to get away from their soontoexplode vehicles,negative
not bothering to shout nor even get close to them she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people,negative
miraculously they manage to hear her and move away,negative
in a movie that specializes in cheap shots the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building,negative
as it does throughout overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girls face,negative
our shows two heroes the crews chief wynt perkins played laconically by scott glenn and his secondincommand jesse graves played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal enter the burning house looking for the little girl,negative
in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames,negative
the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse,negative
this mawkish show cuts back to monica who has a lifeordeath decision to make,negative
the chopper with the fireretardant chemicals has only enough to save one group,negative
will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monicas two firefighting buddies,negative
she has only seconds to decide who will be saved,negative
yes she goes for the majority but miracle of miracles the other three come out alive anyway,negative
not content with a traditional firefighting story chris soths screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape,negative
hoods in the woods is what the groundpounders yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire,negative
along the way shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father who was a marine drill instructor,negative
most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing,negative
he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck,negative
arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside,negative
using a ramp he shoots straight out of the top of the buildings attic and when he hits the ground he just rides off in a cloud of dust,negative
when the film isnt using some stock footage of actual forest fires the simulated ones look hokey,negative
editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions,negative
the ending with its sick twists manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie,negative
perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby its not as bad as some of the television sitcoms,negative
firestorm runs mercifully just 1 29,negative
it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers,negative
house on haunted hill 1999 starring taye diggs geoffrey rush ali larter famke janssen peter gallagher bridgette wilson max perlich lisa loeb james marsters and chris kattan,negative
directed by william malone written by dick beebe,negative
house on haunted hill initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombielike mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible,negative
one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck,negative
a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water,negative
these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous bhorror flicks with grunting noises and cadaverous movements,negative
except this time at the end of the millenium the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be,negative
in past horror films the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims,negative
house on haunted hill doesnt want their audience to have an imagination everything is provided for them to watch and squirm not think,negative
this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film,negative
house on haunted hill which is based on the 1958 film of the same title introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can following the opening blood fest,negative
the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot,negative
the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling unexpected shots of blood guts and mayhem,negative
however the film is neither scary nor unpredictable,negative
the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner geoffrey rush,negative
each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money,negative
since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them,negative
the problem is that every character is not likable,negative
the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer taye diggs who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ali larter,negative
the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them,negative
the worst character in this film or maybe in any film released this year is chris kattans watson pritchett,negative
he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself,negative
waiting for pritchett to die was a strenuously difficult act to sit through,negative
the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price an homage to victor price who starred in the original,negative
playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face,negative
however rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price played by famke janssen,negative
the main problem is that house on haunted hill is not scary,negative
to top off that huge disappointment every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous,negative
if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped similar to deep blue sea the goal for creating a creepy suspenseful action film was completely missed,negative
its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated yet trys a bit too hard,negative
with the voices of woody allen gene hackman jennifer lopez sylvester stallone and sharon stone this computeranimated yakfest think toy story 1996 filled with used merchandising is one for the anteaters,negative
the main story is the independence of a worker named z allen,negative
he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony,negative
when he finds out about insectopia a mythical place where all insects can run free z along with his colonys princess stone journey out into the world to find a meaning for life,negative
about 15 minutes into the picture i began to wonder what the point of the film was,negative
halfway through i still didnt have an answer,negative
by the end credits i just gave up and ran out,negative
antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voiceovers,negative
allen is nonchalant while i would have guessed if i hadnt seen her in the mighty and basic instinct stone cant act even in a cartoon,negative
this film is one for the bugs unfunny and extremely dull,negative
hey a bugs life may have a good time doing antz in,negative
maybe this mission should have been scrubbed,negative
mission to mars,negative
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman,negative
theres a world of difference between artists and technicians,negative
the artist has a vision to create something new,negative
he may not do it well it might be sloppy but its something youve never seen before,negative
a good technician can make it look good but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else its going to be just a xerox,negative
obviously successful films need both skills,negative
brian de palma is a masterful technician,negative
hes spent his career copying others most notably hitchcock,negative
he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work but only because he has learned it by rote,negative
aside from rare flashes of originality his films are often souldead,negative
in de palmas latest he turns his attention to stanley kubrick,negative
to tell the truth i enjoyed portions of this movie but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called 2001,negative
i enjoyed it even more when it was titled close encounters,negative
nasa has set its sights for mars,negative
when the first crew meets with disaster a rescue mission is sent to the red planet,negative
they dont do so well either but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronautgonerasta and solve the mysteries of the universe,negative
and its all so boring,negative
there are so many scenes that just dont work its difficult to begin,negative
when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upsidedown martian tornado which looks remarkably like a sandworm from dune destroying everything in its path they just hang out watching,negative
error,negative
the most interesting character and thats not saying much is killed off,negative
error,negative
the alien is laughable,negative
error,negative
the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable,negative
error,negative
theres some nice eyecandy,negative
the face on mars which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head looks cool,negative
a threedimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world,negative
maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic,negative
but theres so much more that feels as if weve been there before,negative
from 2001 theres the rotating space station the blinding white room,negative
from close encounters they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens,negative
the list goes on,negative
the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues,negative
even gary sinise and tim robbins cant muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing,negative
no one seems to care about anything that happens,negative
you wont either,negative
the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr pepper with a 20 foot tall logo saves the day,negative
they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film,negative
from a major league baseball radio broadcast featuring playby play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown with special guest commentator james berardinelli,negative
hc as we go to the top of the 8th were joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli whos here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie major league back to the minors the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors,negative
nice to see you jim,negative
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer can you give us the scoop on the new flick,negative
jb my opinion the producers should have stopped while they were ahead and that was nine years ago,negative
one entry was definitely enough and im surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released directtovideo,negative
its worse than a mediocre madefortv feature,negative
i should also mention that this movie likely wont play all that well in cleveland,negative
now that the real indians are perennial contenders they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks,negative
actually most of the action involves the twins aaa minor league club the buzz rather than the actual major league franchise,negative
hc sorry to interrupt jim but we still have to do playbyplay for the game on the field,negative
leading off this inning is john warren,negative
he steps into the batters box and takes kents pitch low for ball one,negative
wh so the storys strictly minor league right,negative
whats it about,negative
jb scott bakula the guy from quantum leap plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell,negative
when twins owner roger dorn once again portrayed by corbin bernsen needs a new manager for his aaa team he offers the job to gus who is now faced with two daunting tasks turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson played by walt goggins for a promotion to the show,negative
with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano dennis haysbert rube baker eric bruskotter and isuro tanaka takaaki ishibashi gus gets the buzz on the right track,negative
in fact he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the bigleague club leonard huff played with overthetop relish by ted mcginley,negative
soon dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus overachieving group against huffs overpaid lastplace bunch,negative
wh can we guess who wins,negative
jb the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when youve already seen the box score,negative
on top of that none of the mockups are presented with much flair,negative
theyre not just boring theyre lackluster,negative
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension theyve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs,negative
hc warren fouls off a fastball,negative
1 and 1,negative
wh are there lots of yuks in this one,negative
jb not one from start to finish,negative
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny,negative
okay a lot of the jokes were sophomoric but they made me laugh,negative
the two sequels havent just been stale but their humor quotient has been abysmally low,negative
even bob ueckers oncesharp oneliners have turned lame and theyre the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing,negative
hc heres the 11 pitch,negative
looooooong drive fair or foul foul ball,negative
the count goes to 1 and 2,negative
wh does the film at least get the baseball details correct,negative
jb yes,negative
there arent any glaring errors like there were in one of the bestever baseball movies the natural,negative
but id gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story believable characters or even a little genuine humor,negative
heck the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league back to the minors,negative
wh its nice to see old friends one more time isnt it,negative
like cerrano tanaka and dorn,negative
jb depends on whether you really care that anyone is back,negative
there arent any real characters here just an assortment of cliched oddballs,negative
yeah the voodoo hitter the catcher who cant throw back to the pitcher the japanese player and the conceited playerturnedowner have all returned but who really cares,negative
they have no depth,negative
notable absences include tom berengers veteran and charlie sheens wild thing,negative
we dont really miss them though,negative
hc breaking ball low and outside,negative
2 and 2,negative
wh so youre saying that we should give this one a miss,negative
jb thats right,negative
to use baseball terminology its a threepitch strikeout,negative
if youre looking for a good movie that involves baseball try popping the natural field of dreams bull durham or even the first major league into the vcr,negative
actually this is an oddlytimed release since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters,negative
even the minor league seasons are already underway,negative
dont bother with major league back to the minors,negative
its a wretched time waster,negative
wh thanks for the advice,negative
jb youre welcome,negative
hc and heres the 22 pitch,negative
fouled back right into this booth,negative
hey jim heads up,negative
oops,negative
somebody better get him some ice for that,negative
he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls,negative
odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him almost as if he has a grudge to settle,negative
anyway back to the action on the field,negative
alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most oftenadapted literary works and for good reason the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story,negative
perhaps the musketeer a new film that reimagines the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix is one adaptation too many,negative
its just awful spiritless silly and unforgivably boring transforming the timeless classic into a mishmash of oldastime clich s and incoherent repetitive action sequences,negative
this time dartagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers who cant even pronounce his characters name,negative
as a boy he watched his father get killed by febre tim roth a lackey of powerhungry cardinal richelieu,negative
he vowed to have vengeance,negative
after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman he goes looking for his enemy,negative
on his quest he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government,negative
the royal musketeers have lost their gusto what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinals own guards,negative
only a few loyal swashbuckers remain among them athos and portos who are only figureheads in this movie,negative
together with dartagnan they fight to extricate the queen catherine deneuve from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant,negative
oh and as an afterthought dartagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn mena suvari,negative
just thought id mention that,negative
now look i dont know whose idea this was but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tonguelashing,negative
i have nothing against modernizing classic works of literature at the very least they can inspire viewers to actually read the book but films as dull as this have no positive side effects,negative
director peter hyams known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork the sense of excitement cause and camaraderie,negative
instead we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing,negative
when the musketeers finally get to holler all for one and one for all i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt,negative
maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyamss tone which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the readers digest condensed version of the story that he gives us,negative
its as though anything that may have been construed as fun was purposely expunged from the production,negative
the joylessness of the proceedings from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes can be felt in every frame,negative
chambers cant act suvari roth and deneuve can but arent given the chance,negative
and when push comes to shove the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit,negative
some movies seem sloppy and careless clearly made for a quick buck,negative
with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful,negative
the film is intricate stylish and precise hitting the wrong note every single time,negative
there are scenes in the big hit that are so awful they simply defy description,negative
the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made last action hero 1993 such a chore to sit through,negative
presumably the big hit is an actioncomedy a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off,negative
movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence,negative
lethal weapon 2 1989 is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very very funny,negative
unfortunately in the big hit it seems that comedy is the main motive and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs,negative
unfortunately there are no laughs,negative
the movie resembles some of the goofy throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films but it doesnt benefit from chans incredible stunts and goofy charismatic presence,negative
instead we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg who must have considered himself invincible after his criticallyacclaimed performance in last years boogie nights,negative
however if he wants to maintain a decent career he had better start selecting his projects more carefully movies like this are a surefire recipe for a long career in the straighttovideo market,negative
wahlberg plays melvin smiley an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman see grosse pointe blank for the same character much better developed,negative
the movie wants us to think gee how clever and ironic a guy who can kill without any moral implications and yet he cant stand for anyone not to like him,negative
the fact is melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee christina applegate with a horrendous new york accent and an abusive girlfriend lela rochon who is only using him for his money,negative
his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst,negative
melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris avery brooks as part of a team of hitmen which also includes cisco lou diamond phillips and crunch bokeem woodbine,negative
one day melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi sab shimono for a million dollar ransom,negative
however not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie inside joke get it but his kidnapped daughter keiko china chow also happens to be paris goddaughter,negative
so when paris finds out shes been kidnapped he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it,negative
not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper,negative
of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor innocent melvin,negative
along the way there are several obligatory gunfights explosions and car chases plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by jurassic park and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko who looks like shes barely pushing fifteen,negative
what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers harakiri drinking problems leaking body bags and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation and now spends all his time doing hand exercises,negative
not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of king kong lives which is two weeks overdue,negative
this mess of a movie was helmed by chekirk wong the latest hong kong director imported by john woo who also served as executive producer,negative
woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors and start making more of his own films,negative
wong who directed such films as rocknroll cop back in hong kong is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy,negative
maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean but theyre not here at least in the manner wong handles them,negative
many of the problems can be traced back to the script which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey,negative
in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences ramseys script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar poetic rhythms of tarantino or mametstyle dialogue,negative
what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips whose favorite phrase is its all love and robin dunne who plays ciscos stuttering blackwannabe assistant,negative
the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale which can pretty much describe the film as a whole,negative
remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage,negative
pulp fiction and fargo both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly a slew of ripoffs followed in the years thereafter,negative
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance looks like another of those wannabes but upon closer inspection doesnt look like anything comprehendable,negative
its a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere a film that wont allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous,negative
complexity should come as no surprise to anyone whos familiar with mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspects which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim,negative
that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings,negative
you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that if its really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating,negative
with the way of the gun mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far less commercial a shame because maybe that would have helped,negative
the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but arent hellbent on death either played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro,negative
they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a bigshot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization,negative
they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played by juliette lewis and get a nice ransom,negative
along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played by james caan the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what hes doing,negative
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously cant call the authorities for help,negative
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back,negative
the execs son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right,negative
meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the doublecrosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all,negative
mcquarrie doesnt know the meaning of the word simple,negative
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie,negative
everything has to be complicated and confusing so much so that its to the point of surrealism,negative
nothing is what it seems in this reality its one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industrys rules and regulations,negative
every scene with caans character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him getting into conversations about the business and how it works and were hardly given a clue as to what theyre talking about,negative
these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but theyre more like ideas rippedoff from sketches found in david mamets trash,negative
no one here really acts like a real person and the story is even further removed from reality,negative
its like a dream without any appeal,negative
take the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff,negative
they sit on a brandnew mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they dont move,negative
the guy and his loudmouth pottymouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them,negative
youd think phillipe and del toro are going to pull out guns and scare them away but they dont instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob,negative
theres a lot of things i didnt understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes isnt some yuppie or old rich snob hes like a hippie straight out of the 60s,negative
secondly the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed,negative
lastly it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small countrys army,negative
if they were suicidal they wouldnt have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those guns is never explained either,negative
theres a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility,negative
what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is,negative
absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable,negative
and its all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flatout black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time,negative
with any film you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal was to it why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it,negative
i cant say either for the way of the gun because it has very little going for it and i cant imagine anyone intelligently defending it,negative
stars armand assante mike hammer barbara carrera dr,negative
charlotte bennett laurene landon velda alan king charles kalecki geoffrey lewis joe butler paul sorvino detective pat chambers judson scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma childs mpaa rating r review,negative
in the 1982 updating of mickey spillanes 1947 novel i the jury hardboiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am dresses like don johnson in miami vice with less pastels and has sworn off alcohol,negative
however he still smokes his lucky strikes detests all forms of authority and kills at a whim,negative
beyond that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy pageturner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers,negative
the movie starts off with a bang a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky,negative
after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick downs a onearmed detective and hammers best friend,negative
hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jacks death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino he is immediately on the killers trail,negative
here the movie splits completely from the book and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia the cia one of hammers vietnam vet buddies and a kinky sex clinic,negative
many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different roles,negative
for instance charles kalecki alan king a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book turns into a suave mob boss,negative
and more importantly hammers suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from a runofthemill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic,negative
i the jury is one of several cinematic renditions of spillanes books including a 1953 version which was made in 3d but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywoods production code,negative
although this takes the 1982 version of i the jury closer to the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book,negative
rest assured the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward women,negative
it features one woman having her neck slashed a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot pointblank in the belly by hammer himself,negative
no one would deny that spillanes writing has a definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment its constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling,negative
its no surprise that the movie like the book fades to black with a dead woman on the floor,negative
i the jury had a troubled production and was not wellsupported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didnt do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made,negative
the script was written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies like its alive 1974 and its two sequels q 1981 and the stuff 1985,negative
cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well but he was yanked from the directors chair after only a weeks worth of shooting because he was already 100 000 over budget,negative
he was quickly replaced by richard t heffron who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects,negative
heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently,negative
it shows in the final product,negative
cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron has none,negative
he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scenes ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull,negative
the movie features numerous car chases shootouts and stunts but heffrons background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and fullfrontal nudity i the jury takes on the air of a madefortv quickie with no real punch or depth,negative
but the problems in i the jury run deeper than the technical,negative
the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties,negative
because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person hammers character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona,negative
we never really get that impression in the movie there is no firstperson voiceover narration and some scenes dont have hammer in them at all,negative
consequently a great deal of the texture of spillanes storytelling is lost,negative
the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammers moral code is thrown to the wind,negative
despite his characterization as a hardnosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code,negative
the title itself i the jury refers to his antiestablishment notion of being his own law,negative
unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment,negative
in this way he can be seen as above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality,negative
the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer comes off not only as amoral in societys terms but in any terms especially his own,negative
if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful,negative
maybe the scene was intended for laughs but it only cheapens hammers character and is by all accounts a lousy way to start the movie,negative
the blame for hammers character cant be laid on assantes shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandonlike mumbling he delivers a fine performance,negative
spillane never once described hammers physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him,negative
of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillanes books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations spillane who played the character himself in 1963s the girl hunters is generally considered the best of the film hammers,negative
the rest of actors are most unnoteworthy,negative
with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in i the jury were upandcomers who basically went nowhere,negative
many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had a short stint on dallas in the mideighties which only adds to the madefortv atmosphere of the film,negative
maybe someday someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book but this is certainly not it,negative
a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spains mountainous coastline,negative
howard pigeon jeff goldblum is a 40yearold mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him elizabeth mimi rogers,negative
after a surprise birthday party for him where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party he confides to his best friend that he cant stand it anymore and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon,negative
jeff is going through a severe midlife crises worried that he looks older than his age,negative
he incessantly talks to himself mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive,negative
he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence,negative
things change on their vacation as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch,negative
he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room,negative
by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting,negative
when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot he nervously explains that it was the tv,negative
realizing how unworkable his plan is he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth,negative
but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotels 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him,negative
as a result he goes to the police to report her missing,negative
while with the police a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone,negative
his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him and he gets a job promotion,negative
but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home,negative
there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder,negative
the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room,negative
in jail things look bad for him,negative
no one believes him including his friends and lawyer,negative
his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story pigeon a jailbird,negative
out on bail he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife,negative
through a call placed on his credit card he tracks her down to a mountain resort,negative
once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story,negative
the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance,negative
he is someone coming apart by the seams while mimi rogers is his perfect foil,negative
it was mostly pantomine humor with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation,negative
a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd,negative
the film just didnt take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it so it had no chance for black humor to develop,negative
it instead played its setup of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw,negative
upon first viewing of this movie the phrases been there and done that come quickly to mind,negative
spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series,negative
stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry but only when you steal the right stuff,negative
what little plot there is involves dick steele aka,negative
agent wd40 leslie nielsen trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith,negative
along the way to it goal goal the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act,negative
the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny or at the least satirical,negative
spy hard achieves neither as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films,negative
the dick the world is in danger,negative
what is it,negative
well its a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun,negative
im paraphrasing type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film each time getting progressively less funny,negative
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brothers films while writing their own dialogue,negative
director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors especially nielsen who can do this quite well than on the delivery and context of their lines much of the time cutting the punchline short,negative
the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over as is evident in the final sequence where there is no comedic denouement after the climax,negative
as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context,negative
one of the more amusing was captain of the enterprise james,negative
t kirk,negative
overall i thought this was a very weak effort,negative
while all of the right films to spoof were chosen they used none of the right spoofing methods,negative
next time they should spy a little bit harder,negative
excellent,negative
one of a kind,negative
must see,negative
entertaining,negative
worth the price of admission,negative
fair,negative
nothing much special,negative
what were they thinking,negative
its a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise,negative
the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying,negative
osmosis jones is crude gross disgusting and was directed by the farrelly brothers the twisted siblings behind theres something about mary me myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt,negative
not that theres anything wrong with scatology,negative
i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor such as it was,negative
its merely that with osmosis jones the farrellys humor is too juvenile too predictable,negative
you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn,negative
osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho,negative
the trouble is the animation may please the very young but the jokes may be over their heads while the teenage audience may find it too tame for their tastes,negative
adults well lets just say most will find it unappetizing,negative
osmosis jones plays like a 100minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby,negative
the live action sequences revolve around frank bill murray who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe,negative
he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower,negative
frank much to the consternation of his daughter is a fastfood addict eating anything and everything that can kill you,negative
he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner and presumably smell better than he does,negative
franks body is invaded by thrax a lethal virus after frank eats a hardboiled egg that had fallen to the ground,negative
its not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth,negative
nope the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg wresting it from the primates mouth,negative
like i said the gross meter tips the scales on this one,negative
after ingesting the egg the movie begins its animated sequences,negative
here osmosis jones voiced by chris rock a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix voiced by frasiers david hyde pierce a 12hour painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne,negative
basically what we have is a cliched copbuddy movie rife with all the clich s of that genre,negative
and this is why osmosis jones doesnt click,negative
it merely falls back on tired familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations,negative
the jokes and puns are lame osmosis searches out a snitch a former flu virus,negative
after pumping him for information drix tells osmosis funny he doesnt look fluish,negative
and the jokes dont rise above that level,negative
the live action scenes are no better,negative
frank is such a slob so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child,negative
hes almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters,negative
osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left,negative
the animation is rather twodimensional and flat,negative
it lacks scope and depth,negative
it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater,negative
capsule john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the world is worth saving,negative
he must find some sign of hope in the people of newfoundland,negative
this is little more than a tv skit in movie form,negative
it is watchable and apparently will be released to theaters in canada but it is unlikely to be seen on the international market,negative
it is diverting but hardly a serious piece of cinema,negative
0 4 to 4 minor spoilers in this review,negative
written and directed by john w doyle,negative
john the baptist sent to st john newfoundland,negative
gets an invitation to live with a family,negative
that extraordinary hospitality for some reason does not count as a reason for hope,negative
script has a lot of holes,negative
friend who adopts john is surprisingly militant and is planning actions to destabilize wall street,negative
john does look middle eastern but somehow one expects john the baptist to be more dramatic,negative
there is a conspiracy in the vatican riding on the result of the visit though that result seems small compared to the end of the world,negative
big yucks like seeing a nun give the pope a pedicure and evil popes aid praying to a mendes goat,negative
in large part a satire of life in newfoundland taking licks at things like the poor produce,negative
the one good tomato in grocery by virtue of a miracle must have fallen off the truck to toronto,negative
based on a 20minute short film,negative
there have been bad films in recent years mr,negative
magoo was by far the worst ever made the spectacularly bad blue in the face the horrible baby genuises and now i woke up early the day i died,negative
it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie,negative
the films acting if thats what you want to call it is well mediocre to me,negative
loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit boy was i wrong,negative
after escaping from a mental institution the thief played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty,negative
he turns to burglary to survive robs a loan back kills the loan officer and runs with thousands,negative
a countrywide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down,negative
he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere,negative
now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying,negative
a film which was based on a longlost script by ed wood i have only one question no dialogue only music and movement where exactly is the point,negative
the film moves along at a rather slow pace but does have one advantage the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some,negative
it opens with a fun innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that,negative
some of the low points are when the thief steals a womans purse and then she faints sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom the thief kills to the music of psycho,negative
come on people get some new ideas already,negative
whats even worse is that the film has no plot at all,negative
well to a certain extent it does but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives were bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen,negative
i woke up early the day i died is a perfectly bad film,negative
it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie,negative
even with the huge cast talent the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours,negative
these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run,negative
1970s nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s,negative
few years in the future early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia,negative
however i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period,negative
one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon 1 that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry lack of originality and ideas,negative
being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this film pairs two l a policemen jack colt emilio estevez burnout alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel l jackson bythebook policeman days away from retirement,negative
two of them following the murder of lugers ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies,negative
the authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines,negative
the plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this film borrows its female lead from basic instinct,negative
the best gags are same as with many other similar movies shown in the trailers,negative
the rest simply doesnt work,negative
only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh,negative
others would probably wince at the lameness of humour,negative
some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while,negative
but at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort,negative
the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones,negative
the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel,negative
take two old and dying men a lifetime of regrets a house full of sins a thoroughly despicable man enough lies insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed then add a inexplicable meteorological and amphibianbased phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia the newest film from paul thomas anderson boogie nights,negative
the movie tells multiple stories weaving them together or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time,negative
would that the stories were worth the telling,negative
earl partridge jason robards a thousand acres is dying of cancer,negative
bedridden in much pain it is obvious that his time is growing short,negative
his much younger wife played by julianne moore an ideal husband is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death,negative
having married for money she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied,negative
earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son tom cruise eyes wide shut now a misogynist selfhelp guru who teaches men how to seduce and destroy his sexual and vulgar perspective on relationships is so overthetop as to be utterly unbelievable,negative
meanwhile jimmy gator philip baker hall the insider is also dying of cancer,negative
not as physically incapacitated as earl jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a longrunning quiz show which pits adults against children,negative
the current whizquizkid is stanley spector jeremy blackman in his film debut who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits,negative
on the other hand quiz kid donnie smith william macy mystery men would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a somebody,negative
his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish,negative
jimmy has his own family crisis as his drugaddict daughter melora walters boogie nights refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film,negative
grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop john c reilly never been kissed even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection,negative
this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable twothirds of the movie,negative
and then it gets worse literally raining frogs,negative
yes frogs,negative
assuming it to be an intended deusexmachina device it is an ineffective one because it doesnt seem to faze the characters much,negative
oh they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets but otherwise the frog shower didnt seem to change their behavior or pattern of living or dying,negative
there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch,negative
mr anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble and a heavy handed segment of historical occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing,negative
one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes we may be done with the past but the past is not done with us,negative
this is an absolute lie,negative
god is in the forgiveness business,negative
in fact as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset gods word says that he not only forgives he also forgets,negative
i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins,negative
isaiah 43 25 kjv,negative
the spiritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants to keep us in a state of condemnation,negative
dont let him,negative
next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past take great pleasure in reminding him of his future,negative
he hates that,negative
first rule of fight club is dont talk about fight club,negative
this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film because quite frankly its not even worth mentioning,negative
director david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge,negative
with crude humor an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture im surprised i didnt walk out,negative
this just goes to show that hype kills,negative
its very rare that a film so hyped up as fight club turns out to be noteworthy and this is no exception,negative
the story goes like this,negative
edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions until he meets marla helena bonham carter,negative
norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when he spots her at a session that he also attended,negative
apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like literally living in pain,negative
why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me but things do get worse,negative
norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling and its on a plane that he meets tyler durden brad pitt,negative
the two men develop a bond and go out to a bar and by golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight,negative
how do they come up with this stuff,negative
anyway their fighting catches other pathetic losers attention and a club is formed,negative
out of all this mess there manages to lie a message,negative
fincher shows us that society is like robots,negative
we work in our jobs doing things step by step and want out,negative
our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are and we blame it on others,negative
call me crazy but this is common knowledge,negative
i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably,negative
even with two good actors and a solid actress they only manage to weaken the story,negative
i couldnt help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp,negative
it just shows how desperate the script is for attention,negative
i guess brad pitt was right for this role because i felt like beating him up myself,negative
his bothersome and depressing character made me disgusted at his 20 million fee,negative
it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more,negative
helena bonham carter however really had no purpose,negative
she just popped up on screen mumbled some lines smoked and left,negative
this continues for what seems like 6 hours,negative
the film drags on and my headache gets bigger while fight club nears what i think might be the end,negative
unfortunately by then the film hits rock bottom,negative
though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace,negative
on a side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer,negative
fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson,negative
concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment wont do any good if everything else is in need of support,negative
also im afraid that immature men might respond to the films violence,negative
the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult,negative
when the film ends im just glad to get home and take some advil,negative
youll either enjoy what the film has to offer or agree with ed norton when he says this is so f ing stupid,negative
adam sandler isnt known for appearing in deep thoughtprovoking films but hes still a really funny guy,negative
most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out,negative
big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandlers comic performance and its a miserable failure,negative
sandler plays a thirtysomething loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy played by cole and dylan sprouse,negative
as one might expect from the synopsis director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say goodbye to one another in addition theres a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself,negative
theres a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters and the film features passable performances from sandler joey lauren adams as the love interest and the two young boys but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny,negative
in the past tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman and the hilarious ed wood but lately his films just dont cut it,negative
sleepy hollow has some unique features but the script is a terrible mess,negative
for those who remember disneys fantastic adventures of ichabod crane it is actually superior to this,negative
disneys version was at least interesting while burtons film drags on far too long without any suspense or frights,negative
while the stories are similar the new version adds too much to the once likable story and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off,negative
ichabod crane johnny depp is now apparently a constable who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders,negative
the victims are headless and no traces of evidence were found until the murderer reveals himself hence the headless horseman,negative
now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow,negative
sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster,negative
in the original the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable,negative
no one could stop him not even ichabod,negative
by the end of the film it had audiences in deep thought,negative
burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere and how to make the main characters heroes,negative
he takes no risk what so ever and this is where he fails,negative
another pathetic element of the film was the script,negative
like i said earlier he just stuffed too much in at one time and made it look real sloppy kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims,negative
he completely butchered the story to pieces,negative
thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked,negative
the acting by depp was quite notable,negative
he took the nerdy character of the cartoon and simply acted it out in a better manner,negative
if it wasnt for his quirky oneliners i doubt i could have remained awake because quite frankly i was getting sleepy,negative
just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress she winds up doing this,negative
it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster,negative
its too tempting to let go even if the script is mush,negative
the atmosphere too was quite involving,negative
i should have just gazed at the sets and the eerie fog rather than actually pay attention to what was going on,negative
at least burtons films are eye candy even if they are trash,negative
the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads and the fight between the horseman depp and casper van dien,negative
other than that i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film and just sit back and stare at the scenery,negative
by the end i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed,negative
this is the biggest disappointment of the year especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this,negative
dont waste your time or money because your head will feel hollow,negative
what a contrast,negative
in the space of two days i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly,negative
im not sure you could get two more different movies,negative
while the former was all over the top telegraphing everything shoving its philosophy of life down our throats hurlyburly was the complete opposite wound so tight and with so much buried in its script one could spend weeks thinking about it,negative
this is one interesting movie,negative
its very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of 98 in the company of men although not quite so nasty,negative
theres lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men,negative
hurlyburly doenst contain much plot we just follow eddie sean penn around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him,negative
his big question is does it all pertain to him,negative
and if it does how is he supposed to feel about it all,negative
it means everything television friends events that happen,negative
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as whats it all about,negative
this is not a movie for answers,negative
donna anna paquin gives some but theyre not really satisfying they just lead to more questions,negative
thats what makes this movie stay on your mind,negative
these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time,negative
even when we push them to the background however we resolve these questions influences everything we do,negative
the performances are all superb in hurlyburly,negative
i havent seen sean penn in much before in fact i cant remember seeing him in anything but he is brilliant in this,negative
eddie isnt a likeable character but sean penn makes him understandable,negative
i dont want to be his friend but id like to help him,negative
chazz palminteri is also great as phil making him an awful person,negative
id never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend,negative
everyone in this film nails their performances making this world real,negative
its a nasty world its a sexist world,negative
unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct hurlyburly is a mans world seen unapologetically through the eyes of men,negative
i find this fascinating and on two counts depressing,negative
first its depressing that such a world exists,negative
a large part of hurlyburlys success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world toys playthings,negative
sure everyone is background to everyone else but in this world women are a long way in the background,negative
second these are the movies that are being made stories about mens world,negative
where are the stories about womens world,negative
not the soap operas and the chick flicks that are meant to satisfy women but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men,negative
hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts,negative
its very talkative intelligent and static,negative
while this can make the film drag a bit and people sometimes sound like theyre quoting textbooks mostly this is a good thing,negative
not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas,negative
not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience,negative
all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen,negative
it also means that you have to pay attention,negative
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,negative
be forewarned,negative
i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 sciencefiction flick species,negative
squandering an intriguing premise the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success raking in over 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ben kingsleys a splendid actor but a marquee name he aint,negative
miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film i doubted that theyd dare tempt fate and go for another round,negative
so here comes species ii with a new creative team director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman respectively that fails to improve the series one iota like its predecessor species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid,negative
the film follows the exploits of a young man patrick ross justin lazard whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women loitering in strip clubs and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can,negative
in other words patrick is like a lot of guys these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age but theres a catch hes an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars and whos now infected with alien dna,negative
patricks overriding compulsion to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring,negative
and when he becomes aware of eve natasha henstridge a halfhuman halfalien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab patricks primary focus turns to her if these two were to mate the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable warns dr laura baker marg helgenberger gamely reprising her role with admirable conviction,negative
species ii opens with the mars mission and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokeylooking even splicing back to dated grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities they really skimped on production values this time around,negative
however this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy bmovie is quickly answered,negative
mr brancatos original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches,negative
like the first film and perhaps in homage to it theres a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious,negative
last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitakers psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room something bad happened here,negative
this time laura gets to stand over a fresh shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter this is awful,negative
and shes not even empathic,negative
and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefullypaced suspense sequence eve whos telepathically linked to her hybrid counterpart whatever helpfully tells our alienhunting protagonists hes going to rape her,negative
while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own,negative
theres an amusing tongueincheek bit of product placement which doesnt really make much sense but i appreciated the sentiment as well as some supermarketrelated hijinx hes in aisle 1,negative
informs eve,negative
if the film maintained this sort of lighthearted tone it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch but to its detriment it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody effectsladened anticlimactic conclusion,negative
much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense and there are such gaping plot holes that its terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief,negative
the implausibilities are endless what about the toxic bomb in eves brain,negative
why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual,negative
my favourite was the slowmotion sequence in the film where eve sporting superhuman strength is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks,negative
this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief incredulous that its being foisted upon the public,negative
returning headlines michael madsen who reprises tough guy press lennox and ms helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay but theres realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis,negative
mykelti williamson portraying astronaut dennis gamble churns out an alltoofamiliar spin on a generic brashmouthed character and fine character actors george dzundza playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process and james cromwell patricks neglectful father senator ross are utterly wasted in the film,negative
mr lazard gives his character an appropriately shiftyeyed look while returning vixen ms henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene and acquits herself nicely but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing or none at all,negative
ms henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series claiming that shes so empowered,negative
a lethal halfalien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion now thats what i call empowerment,negative
robin williams has the rarest of gifts the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style,negative
overwhelmingly his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best with the notable exception of flubber,negative
so when i the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams tell you that not even williams can save his latest project you know its in trouble,negative
jakob the liar is a confused muddled little movie a generically uplifting film with a fundamental contradiction the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesnt realize it,negative
williams plays jakob haim a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii,negative
one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a highranking german officer for his punishment,negative
jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast,negative
the announcement in english but punctuated by a triumphant heil hitler is that russian troops are only miles away from jakobs ghetto,negative
liberation he thinks,negative
the next day jakob tells the news to his closest friend a volatile prize fighter named misha liev schreiber who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along,negative
soon it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home a crime punishable by death,negative
this is absurdly false but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate,negative
the danger of course is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger,negative
in a curiously irrelevant subplot jakob finds a 11year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home,negative
apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered and goes to great length to make sure of that just why the idea frightens him is never made clear,negative
he and the girl build an uninvolving generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning,negative
the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine,negative
but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false,negative
such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations arent met the results are far worse than if there was no hope,negative
thats the films biggest detriment it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false,negative
its never moving because it doesnt give us anything to be moved by,negative
jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing,negative
robin williams doesnt inject the film with life as a matter of fact he seems a little out of it as if crippled by his fake accent,negative
he is stragely unenthusiastic his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless hopeless,negative
not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent this isnt the robin williams we know and love,negative
in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it,negative
here he is more of a wannabe serious actor an impostor,negative
jakob the liar will be compared with last years life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a holocaust comedy,negative
its not a comedy,negative
it tries sometimes but it rarely works,negative
is it a melodrama,negative
a war movie,negative
a character study,negative
no no and no,negative
jakob the liar is the kind of movie that cant be placed into a category not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts,negative
we could paraphrase michelle pfieffers character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an a,negative
thats fair enough,negative
all movies like all school children should be given the benefit of the doubt,negative
the chance to succeed,negative
after all we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders,negative
mountains can be moved and good movies can be made,negative
yeah right,negative
children fail as do films,negative
as does director john boormans latest,negative
the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ed wood true romance as the busty westernerinperil wandering about 1988 burma without a passport,negative
though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there its a tougher task to overlook the actress,negative
shes a lightweight,negative
as the first scene with narration,negative
demonstrates she doesnt have nearly enough range for the emotions that her charactera mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and sonis supposed to show,negative
she may give a stronger performance than say keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds by not by much,negative
beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman deliverance excalibur hope and glory,negative
he keeps the narrative moving no matter how muddy the storyor the heroinegets,negative
why he chose arquette remains a mystery though,negative
maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies,negative
but even after an hour of halfstated political statements and murky mass killings we still dont know enough of whats happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations,negative
empty exoticism,negative
the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix combining lush jungle photography with bad bluescreen work,negative
also odd is the obvious dubbing,negative
done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign,negative
and is it my mistake or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers,negative
doo doo doo doo,negative
twilight zone theme or opinion of movie,negative
you be the judge,negative
it was not scary,negative
these are the first words that came to mind after it was over,negative
when a movie is called vampires not scary arent words that should be associated with it,negative
but that wasnt my only gripe,negative
john carpenter is a name associated with cuttingedge cinema as in the intense scares of halloween the thing and the prince of darkness or the offbeat action of they live and escape from new york,negative
unfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about vampires is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach,negative
with an anemic plot and notquitekosher special effects john carpenters vampires has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan,negative
the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers led by james woods of all people,negative
like some sort of holy ateam they even have their own soupedup van the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack,negative
their method is amusingly innovative the bloodsuckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks,negative
to commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away,negative
their celebration is shortlived however as a master vampire named valek ambushes and singlehandedly destroys most of the team,negative
woods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape with their lives along with a woman named katrina sheryl lee,negative
although the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire,negative
the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith a freaky marilyn mansontype whos on a mission that dates back 600 years,negative
along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau tim guinee a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl,negative
upham in saving private ryan,negative
some stuff happens in the middle of the movie but i cant remember most of it because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen,negative
vampires finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prisonturned vampire nest,negative
only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick,negative
but its too little too late,negative
we get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anticlimactic come on were dealing with the master vampire here,negative
interestingly last summers vampire actioner blade was derived from a comic book and vampires from a novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former a more deliberate superhero flick,negative
woods jack crow spouts glib offthecuff oneliners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that ohsocool stride,negative
and his motive for killing vampires,negative
take a wild guess,negative
hint a killed his when he was just a,negative
at least blade had decent action and slick stylishness,negative
vampires lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamerthin plot,negative
to make up for this the movie resorts to other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to getting woodies,negative
it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie,negative
if not scary and gory i wanted tense relentless and exhausting,negative
john carpenters vampires is none of these,negative
i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan,negative
for the rest of you looking for a good scare beware vampires is a film with no teeth,negative
i never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently,negative
ive just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth,negative
after all ive never been to war ive never been the victim of any violent crime ive never really been broken hearted and ive never been audited so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was hell on earth,negative
then i saw cruel intentions,negative
in a perfect world i would be in charge of all the movie studios,negative
the very first thing id do in this perfect world would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail,negative
but it wouldnt just be your average jail not even a maximum security installation,negative
id have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity,negative
now youre probably thinking to yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is,negative
the answer is no,negative
its actually much worse,negative
watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound,negative
and then pouring acid on the salt,negative
i dont know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom,negative
from that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz to the conclusion which i dont remember because i had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there with war and tax audits,negative
54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring,negative
a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors,negative
i however would rather cut to the chase,negative
54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring,negative
there is nothing in it not a glimpse of depth nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight,negative
there is no electricity in any of the scenes or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots,negative
and its underdeveloped and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think theyre in this years boogie nights,negative
they are so wrong,negative
the picture has been assembled by mark christopher,negative
based on this film i dont know how he got a job in the business,negative
54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s,negative
i dont know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas andersons brilliant work in every possible way from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography,negative
what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great depth intelligence energy fascinating characters and challenging themes,negative
54 cant even measure up to the last days of disco which is flawed but still smart and entertaining,negative
its remarkably bad timing id say to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind,negative
i have exaggerated though there is one interesting character and one terrific performance,negative
that character is steve rubell played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves,negative
steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 and if christopher had focused on him then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself,negative
alas we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ryan phillippe a goingnowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club thanks to rubells homosexual impulses,negative
its here that he meets his friends the array of uninteresting characters his coworker greg brecklin meyer his wife anita salma hayek and of course the love interest julie black neve campbell,negative
shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning and he has a reasonably sturdy home life,negative
some of the scenes with his father border on interesting while heather matarazzo who plays his sister pushes phillippe off the screen,negative
but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs,negative
why his friends push him into drugs is never really explained but the fact that they are friends is questioned only is superficial ways greg gets really mad at shane because hes been elevated to bartender status,negative
there isnt a single conflict that takes center stage except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works,negative
most of the film is dumb and most of the dialogue is inane,negative
theres a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black and in the next scene theyre arminarm without a bit of development,negative
then theyre kissing in a bowling alley,negative
this is five minutes of material thrown into the picture at the last minute well past the onehour mark and this isnt a long film to begin with,negative
campbell is a talented actress but she needs a role that gives her a little depth,negative
this one doesnt,negative
and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever this performance pales in comparison to mark whalbergs starmaking role in boogie nights,negative
he seems dumb and misguided and his voice never changes tone,negative
i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body but he seems pretty lanky to me,negative
hes all wrong for a lead role but it doesnt help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters,negative
by the end of 54 shanes most notable trait is his stupid fake accent,negative
the rest of the performances are wasted,negative
hayek is an energetic talented young actress and does almost nothing here,negative
meyer is endearing but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard,negative
only myers by sheer force of talent manages to rise above christophers wadingpool of a script,negative
rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance,negative
in fact myers is the sole reason to see 54 and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him,negative
ive read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail,negative
frankly i dont care,negative
its easy to recreate something technical like this,negative
a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task,negative
besides christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible anyway,negative
aside from myers performance 54 is a complete failure,negative
its dull perfunctory uninspired and boring,negative
some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair but theyre so obvious to me,negative
in any event 54 is pallid without the contrast,negative
it doesnt even work as mindless entertainment its so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it,negative
so dont forget those key words dull perfunctory uninspired and boring,negative
everything else i said was just padding,negative
knock off is exactly that a cheap knock off of an action movie,negative
its also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year,negative
i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 but alas it has already been found,negative
jeanclaude van damme stars as i think a designer jeans executive who discovers his halfbrother has been supplying him with cheaper goods,negative
rob schneider plays van dammes partner and rochon plays,negative
actually i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be,negative
she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there,negative
many things are not explained in this film but i do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick,negative
where chan comes off as endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his films van damme just comes off as a wimp,negative
were never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions,negative
to be more clear i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it was not made too clear,negative
the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong,negative
tsui hark who directed van dammes last movie the bad but not nearly as bad as this double team never lets the camera rest for a second and thats no exaggeration,negative
we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van dammes foot entering a shoe,negative
fabulous,negative
seriously though i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions as long as they dont get carried away,negative
for example look at sam raimi,negative
army of darkness one of his best movies features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story,negative
thats a concept that tsui cant seem to grasp,negative
the special effects and outrageous camera angles rule knock off to the point where the audience doesnt have a clue as to whats happening any more,negative
another problem with the film is that it looks cheap,negative
the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night,negative
and for some inexplicable reason everyones voice seems to have been dubbed,negative
even the stars,negative
and even the special effects seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent,negative
for example there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window,negative
the car slams into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed,negative
seconds later the car drives off at full speed,negative
hey i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but a line must be drawn somewhere,negative
finally the acting,negative
nobody gives a good performance in this film,negative
van damme an actor i usually like is way off the mark playing everyman,negative
and schneider here to provide comic relief i assume is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene,negative
even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly overthetop performance as,negative
once again i have no idea who he was supposed to be,negative
in case i havent yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van dammes career and possibly the worst movie of the decade,negative
and its not even one of those movies thats so bad its funny,negative
its too inept to be funny,negative
there are no redeeming factors in knock off and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased,negative
recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldnt sleep,negative
he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour,negative
then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food,negative
then he took down a volume of shakespeares work and read it cover to cover never really paying attention to the words or plot,negative
and then as a climax he took out his video camera and pressed the on button,negative
the result,negative
william shakespeares romeo juliet the worst film ever made and a complete failure,negative
though to be fair an interesting complete failure,negative
the idea at the films core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds,negative
this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we cant see what is going on,negative
and filming the dialogue in voice over,negative
and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model,negative
and making the frame go still while flashing the characters name at the bottom,negative
and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion,negative
i mean man this is the 90s dude,negative
however ive seen terrible films that are fun to watch,negative
examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau,negative
that rule doesnt apply here,negative
this is a film that takes itself seriously,negative
that is its major fault,negative
another problem was pointed out by my friend alex who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout,negative
the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didnt take sides,negative
here its clear that we are supposed to side with romeo,negative
just look at the way they film him,negative
from the begining hes our hero and this doesnt work,negative
and dicaprios awful performance doesnt help,negative
luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us,negative
the result is a mess,negative
you can feel him striving to be something he isnt,negative
he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles,negative
he tries very hard,negative
key word tries,negative
oh look hes filming above water action from below,negative
pretty,negative
what does it represent,negative
why do people do ugly things,negative
i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face,negative
some houses are born bad goes the hauntings tag line to which i must add some movies too,negative
nothing short of hiring a new cast a more literate screenwriter and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jacksons meritorious novel,negative
the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects dont frighten so much as numb the audience into submissionthe film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout boo,negative
fragile nell taylor bisexual theo zetajones and smiley luke wilson are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders hosted by professor marrow neeson,negative
marrows secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill houses bleak history,negative
hes not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew nell especially who has some ancestral connection to the manors previous inhabitants,negative
taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first bigbudget lead,negative
for starters her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes when were introduced to the mansion and all its funhouse trappings,negative
her character is supposed to be depressed having tended to an unloving mother for too many years but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame alternately grouchy mopey wiggy and pathetic and i kept wondering why the other characters didnt just ditch this bitch,negative
as for the obscenely photogenic zetajones she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her,negative
unfortunately shes saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer,negative
theos assessment of the house,negative
i love it,negative
sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters,negative
who on earth would say that in place of citizen kane meets the munsters,negative
furthermore would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description,negative
both actresses fare better than neeson who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble and for good reason and his character is the most bland,negative
as luke puts it dr marrow pulls the old academic bait and switch on his subjects but he breaks down and confesses to this the second hes accused,negative
later he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell its amusing to hear neeson shout nell repeatedly given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name,negative
why was this nice helpful and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start,negative
the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti,negative
his sets are obsessively detailed and even before the cgi kicks in they seem alive never quite still,negative
i do have one beef with this aspect of the production the real life mansion used in exterior shots nottinghamshires harlaxton manor is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins always finish up in locations that were established in act one as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house,negative
eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting and despite a powerhouse box office debut i doubt it will recoup its costs including marketing domestically,negative
thank jan de bont for that proving for the third time that speed was a fluke in that it was actually enjoyable de bont has served up another ride sans thrill,negative
his images welllit though they are have an unmistakable been theredone that quality in fact whole sequences not to mention the cloaked airy ghoul who owns the climax feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back peter jacksons the frighteners,negative
i dont mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist i mean to suggest that hes a hack having found no new ways to give us chills,negative
heres a concept jeanclaude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie,negative
now if that isnt enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie i dont know what is,negative
all sarcasm aside it is certainly a different way to start a movie of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother so lucky us we get to see more of jeanclaude,negative
van damme 1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives,negative
van damme 2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after 1 gets killed in france,negative
the remaining twin the french cop goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death,negative
once there he hooks up with his deceased brothers girlfriend played by natasha henstridge and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are,negative
jeanclaudes acting abilities dont seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie,negative
in other words just in case you missed the sarcasm his acting is worse than normal,negative
on the upside natasha henstridge is in this film and she does what she did best in species she gets naked,negative
sadly this is probably the high point in the movie,negative
she is actually a decent actress but didnt improve as much as i thought she would after species,negative
this is the typical van damme movie with jeanclaude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents,negative
nothing new here and certainly nothing we havent seen in every other van damme movie,negative
simply put there is absolutely nothing new about this movie,negative
it has a retread plot this isnt the first time jeanclaude has played twins,negative
he still cant act,negative
we all saw natashas breasts in species although this is one repeat performance im not complaining about,negative
this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in sub par,negative
whenever u s government starts meddling into other countries affairs under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political religious or ethnic persecution the other side is ready to use mantra that says look whos talking,negative
what have you done to the indians,negative
however even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes,negative
hollywood is just another example with its revisionist westerns made in early 1990s,negative
those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus discovery of america,negative
one of such examples is geronimo an american legend 1993 western directed by walter hill film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers,negative
the hero of the film is geronimo played by wes studi leader of apaches fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century,negative
when the movie begins in 1885 geronimo and his apaches made peace with u s government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation,negative
however broken promises injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless,negative
with not more 30 or so of his followers he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign,negative
general crook gene hackman commander of u s army forces respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 000 force isnt enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest,negative
instead he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches lt charles gatewood jason patric and indian hunter al sieber robert duvall,negative
together with young lt britton davis matt damon they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo,negative
geronimo an american legend like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors,negative
so the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies,negative
almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people,negative
although such elements of john millius screenplay do indeed have some basis in history they harm the story of geronimo,negative
to be honest walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time,negative
instead they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band,negative
to make even worse hill has some real problems with pacing and style and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one story about geronimo and story about his pursuers,negative
the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimos life before and after his last uprising in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood,negative
the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting,negative
wes studi cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans was perfect choice for geronimo not only because he resembles geronimo but because he induces a lot of passion in his role,negative
contrary to him we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies,negative
while this could be expected from someone like jason patric it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall,negative
even hills directing is bellow expectations battle scenes are too short and like in many of his late films force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s,negative
even his old associate music composer ry cooder disappoints with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic,negative
on the other hand photography by lloyd ahern ii with the use of red lenses gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic,negative
all in all compared with some of the hollywoods examples of political correctness this film isnt so bad but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better,negative
several days after having seen this movie im still trying to determine what director christopher guest a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes,negative
this is a dreadful motion picture a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughstojokes ratio,negative
theres a kind of desperation in the movies approach to humor that reveals the film makers uncertainty about how entertaining the material is the manic style betrays itself as a lastditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script,negative
the premise doesnt sound especially amusing to begin with almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers the effeminate leslie edwards matthew perry and the uncouth bartholomew hunt chris farley who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest,negative
edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies albeit of the early19th century variety including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages none of which prove to be useful a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries,negative
along the way the intrepid explorers encounter bears bald eagles aging native american warriors and a conquistador named hildago kevin dunn who raves about his beautiful hair,negative
the explorers trek takes them through forests across the snowcapped rocky mountains and over a waterfall,negative
this setup leads to a lot of shouting a great deal of lunacy and very few laughs,negative
farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing but aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle his heart doesnt seem to be in it,negative
matthew perry one of the stars of tvs friends who had some modest success in the romantic comedy fools rush in is badly miscast,negative
as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man,negative
im not a big fan of david spade and i didnt like tommy boy but at least he and farley worked well together,negative
as far as the supporting players go none of them makes more than a fleeting impression,negative
eugene levy is wasted and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla,negative
frankly its a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap the big picture and waiting for guffman,negative
although guest gets the costumes right this nearlyinconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution,negative
the special effects such as they are are execrable,negative
for an example of some really poor blue screen work look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids theyre obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them and where farley is being carried off by an eagle,negative
even though farley didnt have the most stellar of acting careers he doesnt deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes,negative
while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12year old boys the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric,negative
farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session,negative
tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse,negative
the fugitive,negative
not quite this is the plot for double jeopardy another fugitive copycat without the action excitement and good acting that the original had,negative
there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall clever huh,negative
oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband bruce greenwood who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man,negative
both movies are on video,negative
make the wise choice and pick the fugitive,negative
there are so many flaws in double jeopardy it is laughable,negative
while serving time in prison libby parsons judd discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice,negative
learning that her husband is still alive she decides to serve her time in prison find him retrieve her son and kill her husband if necessary,negative
when the strict parole officer travis lehman jones stands in her way libby decides to break the rules who knows why and continue her plan despite the fact that if she gets caught shes going back to jail,negative
director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son,negative
every other scene we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture,negative
in an action movie like this valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something,negative
all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend i miss my son,negative
nothing more nothing less,negative
dr kimble of the fugitive didnt look at one picture of his dead wife his primary concern was to save himself,negative
libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough,negative
ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this they will be typecast for the rest of their careers kind of like their doomed costar tommy lee jones,negative
winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his idomyjobwhethertheyareinnocentorguilty roles,negative
people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right,negative
though i dont think he will win another oscar again,negative
the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons,negative
even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count,negative
burglary assault grand theft auto are some of libbys slipups,negative
the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as youre innocent of the major crime,negative
hopefully criminals wont use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent,negative
that would just be plain stupid,negative
instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as powerful or touching,negative
i have a name for it myself gross,negative
this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully the bully looks at the rebel threateningly about to hurt him and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too,negative
how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me arent present day moviegoers beyond being inspired by something like that,negative
this is one example there are actually some more in instinct alone of filmmakers insulting the audiences intelligence,negative
instincts plot is brimming with potential worldrenowned anthropologist ethan powell anthony hopkins disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa,negative
he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him,negative
after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport the authorities stick him in a prisons psychotics ward,negative
assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright or so we are told young psychiatrist theo caulder cuba gooding jr,negative
caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career,negative
of course and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison,negative
and then theres the inevitable heartless meanie character in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulders mentor,negative
he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell,negative
lets get one thing straight dr theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen on screen or off,negative
any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way,negative
not good old theo,negative
no he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says we need to talk about this right now,negative
this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instincts already dubious credibility unfortunately its also the least of its problems,negative
director jon turteltaub who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly abovepar cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that contrary to what this movies promotion would have you believe it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs,negative
its not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus excuse the graphic depiction,negative
it aims to inspire rather than to touch hearts,negative
as yoda would say inspire it does not,negative
it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter the very experienced gerald di pego has to resort to literally telling the audience a movies story,negative
indeed somewhere in the beginning of instinct one of the characters actually reads aloud the films plot to another character,negative
this like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review is a horrid insult to our intelligence,negative
i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation,negative
i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors and he chews the scenery in this movie brilliant as ever,negative
oscar winner cuba gooding jr on the other hand is dreadful,negative
his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink,negative
i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling,negative
i love animals and instincts prominent save the in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with,negative
however this movies execution is completely unacceptable,negative
tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick,negative
1999 eugene novikov,negative
it seems that ive stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch,negative
take payback for example a movie that most people seem to like,negative
however its horrible schlock straight out of hollywoods vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies,negative
it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better however maybe he did do better after all 30 percent of the movie isnt his own,negative
mel gibson that hollywood zombie decided he didnt like the ending and had another director reshoot it,negative
what a crock,negative
if you sign on to do a movie then do it the way the script calls for,negative
why film a movie and then look at it later and say no i changed my mind i dont like the ending,negative
youre fired,negative
lets get someone else to do it,negative
i suppose honor is dead in hollywood,negative
the end of the film is of course hollywoodized,negative
which is to say that its happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize,negative
in this case as is most victories in hollywood movies gibsons prize is a blond and money,negative
i miss originality in film i really do,negative
i think audiences are so starved for it that theyll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original,negative
paybacks tagline get ready to root for the bad guy promised an original idea but it was far from the truth,negative
while gibsons character certainly broke the law he was a character that had honor odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it wouldnt kill in front of children and protects his blond woman,negative
theres nothing bad about him hes a hollywood character a person who could never exist in real life,negative
and gibson knows it he spends his time trying to act like a bad guy and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant,negative
the story involves gibson being doublecrossed by his partner who is a real bad guy which made me wish that we could root for him over 70 000,negative
gibson recovers from multiple gunshots is pissed naturally and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back no more no less,negative
he makes a point of it that its strictly 70 grand,negative
a real bad guy would have made his expartner pay 25 interest,negative
this idea is completely stretched out,negative
gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with,negative
what i didnt understand this is the chicago mafia,negative
70 000 is like spare change to them,negative
theyd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him,negative
i think theyd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple 70 000,negative
maybe im being too hard on the movie,negative
perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie,negative
i read roger eberts review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy,negative
thats why were allowed to root for him,negative
and its true gibson walks the movie as if hes smiling at a joke he just heard,negative
but hes wrong here,negative
i wanted a lee marvin or oldtime clint eastwood or somebody who wasnt a comic just an ass kicker,negative
as a side note ive just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback,negative
after this many reviews why would anyone want to read this,negative
really i dont care,negative
im just trying to gain membership into the online film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can,negative
in dreams might keep you awake at night but not because of its creepy imagery bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths,negative
no the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movies brutally squandered potential the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise even by tired serial killer genre standards,negative
the big letdown however comes upon the realization that this 100minute headscratcher was masterminded by neil jordan the man behind the crying game,negative
hes no stranger to cinematic weirdness but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope,negative
things start out strong enough with cinematographer darius khondjis stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat,negative
this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film theres even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic seemingly innocent new england autumn but if there ever was a film that didnt deserve so good a polish its this one,negative
dont knock the look but say what you will about the foolish plot underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue,negative
annette bening another asset in dreams shouldnt be so lucky to boast gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesnt do much for her in return,negative
she plays claire cooper a massachusetts childrens book illustrator whos plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children,negative
she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible soontobecommitted crimes but neither her hohum husband aidan quinn nor the hohummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously,negative
this being a thriller we know that she is in fact on the money and its a credit to benings acting that she delves equally into claires madness and compassion,negative
but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims in dreams trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense,negative
scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition,negative
subplots appear and disappear,negative
when claire finally comes facetoface with our evil murderer robert downey jr it turns out his name is vivian hes clairvoyant and hes got some major issues with mama a la norman bates,negative
in dreams reaches its absurdist zenith here and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists,negative
some questions then whats with the garbage disposal retching applesauce,negative
are the drawings on the wall blood or paint,negative
who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own,negative
what about the computer,negative
does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers,negative
why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan,negative
is the woman in australia integral to anything,negative
and the aforementioned flooded city what function does that really serve,negative
sigh,negative
at least in my own dreams i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didnt go to waste,negative
when i ponder childhood memories past one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the inspector gadget tv show with my older brother,negative
truth be told we were rabid fanatics our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr claw the inspectors arch nemesis,negative
i was never a biggie on nostalgia but you just cant help but have fond memories of something like that,negative
sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching reruns of my favorite episodes trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid,negative
at the very least i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me,negative
despite how horrid a film may be the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up,negative
so back i sat with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver lets face it exactly how good can a liveaction disney film really be,negative
i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr magoo and george of the jungle two previous disney adaptations and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well,negative
rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness,negative
as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind i was left sitting there absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen,negative
can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world,negative
right from the beginning i knew i was in trouble,negative
in the opening scenes each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be to simply serve as reallife duplicates of their cartoon clones,negative
when referring to them people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be oh hi penny,negative
is brain with you,negative
creating onedimensional replicas is one thing having mere names take the place of them is quite another,negative
the plot shall we call it stays fairly in tune with the original series,negative
matthew broderick stars as john brown how creative is that,negative
a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex why rupert everett for the love of god why who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events,negative
brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new lawenforcement technology wherein hes joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form drumroll please,negative
inspector gadget,negative
from here on out the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations although to be fair my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind,negative
theres something about an evil gadget taking over the city his first crime must have been swiping matt dillons dentures from theres something about mary and it all ends with what else a bunch of postcredit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself,negative
to be honest i wasnt much paying attention to these treats,negative
i was just glad that it was over,negative
i looked at the internet movie database s awards section for this film and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for best picture drama,negative
anyone whos seen this film can back me up on this this is the worst of the great disaster films and thats not really saying a lot for this film,negative
earthquake is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured,negative
on video its a bland and slowmoving film which gives us a bunch of different characters the disaster film requisite then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster,negative
while this worked in say the towering inferno it doesnt here for one single reason we dont care about any of the characters,negative
the film gives us charlton heston in one of many crap 70s films he made including skyjacked and that classic soylent green as a rich man married to ava gardner who is having a little affair with a young single mom genieveve bujold a renegade police officer on suspension george kennedy in his least humored performance in the second weirdest subplot a motorcycle stuntman richard roundtree right after his shaft thing whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down yea snore and the weirdest subplot a military boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair,negative
in smaller subplots theres a pointless bit about people who are flying over l a the city in the film by the way one whos playing cards and married to a boring nonacting husband you think this one can go nowhere,negative
guess again he gets interested in the final frames theres genieveve bujolds moron son who has a little adventure with wires and for some muchneeded comedy theres walter matthau billed as walter mutha,negative
the only laugh in the film as a wild drunkard whos big moment is a dance he does at a critical time,negative
as for the actual earthquake its rather a letdown,negative
theres a full hour of charactersetups none of which is interesting then about 10 minutes of shaking crumbling and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold narrowly missing,negative
this film needed that whole theatreshaking they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored,negative
theres little suspense following the quake although this film tries for it,negative
theres an adventure in a crumbling highrise office building the wires with the kid and the movement of people who are all injured,negative
but none of these are alltoo suspenseful,negative
the finale with the bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flipofthecoin bit which brings out a big letdown,negative
and theres no real finale,negative
even volcano ended nicely and that movie really sucked,negative
not only is it hokey but you dont care about any character,negative
who cares if heston dies,negative
who cares if he choses bujold or gardner although i would have chosen gardner mainly on the basis that she can actually act,negative
who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid stunt,negative
who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires,negative
and who cares about that whole plane spiel,negative
if anything earthquake is worth a viewing for the same reason glen or glenda,negative
is,negative
i mean i laughed at this more than i did at bio dome,negative
but thats another story and review,negative
in short earthquake gives disaster pics a bad name,negative
best remembered for his understated performance as dr hannibal lecter in michael manns forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on,negative
usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight hes only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do,negative
if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loachs hidden agenda,negative
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l i e which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge,negative
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad,negative
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light,negative
hes an eventempered funny robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems as opposed to their parents and friends both caught up in the highwire act of their own confused lives,negative
hell have sexforpay with them only after an elaborate courtship charming them with temptations from the grownup world,negative
l i e stands for long island expressway which slices through the strip malls and middleclass homes of suburbia,negative
filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a pretty transparent metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15year old protagonist howie paul franklin dano,negative
in his opening voiceover howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road citing the l i e,negative
highway deaths of filmmaker alan j pakula songwriter harry chapin and his own mother on exit 52,negative
hes both fascinated and disturbed by the l i e and those feelings are projected onto big john who follows howie around in his bright red car but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesnt want to do,negative
this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies hes a beast but ashamed of it,negative
l i e would have worked best as a halfhour short film about howies illadvised foray into big johns haven,negative
there is unnecessary padding with howies miserable dad bruce altman in the hot seat for a whitecollar crime degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middleclass houses and some homoerotic shenanigans with wiseass gary terrio billy kay a handsome artful dodger,negative
rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui not that we needed another movie on that subject these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length,negative
concurrently the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted,negative
cox sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo is all bluff and bluster,negative
dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent,negative
were so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious calling haley joel its surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene,negative
the restraint is admirable,negative
but l i e s screenplay doesnt always give them the best material,negative
when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem the moment feels a bit too precious,negative
director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bachs goldberg variations,negative
its too much,negative
there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big johns other boy toy walter masterson jealous over the newbie,negative
this plot thread predictably leads to violence,negative
not content to be a haunting observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world like terry zwigoffs superb ghost world cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note,negative
its typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex philosophical note,negative
in this regard l i e,negative
and countless other indie films share something in common with blockbuster action films problems are solved when the obstacle is removed,negative
how often does real life work this way,negative
to extend the question if a movie is striving for realism do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion,negative
the last of vampirefilms offers plenty of blood and gore but beyond that nothing,negative
jack crow james woods is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican,negative
his and his mens mission is to clean the earth from vampires,negative
they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered but one has always escaped them,negative
valek thomas ian griffith the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself,negative
for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation the black cross,negative
with the cross in their possesion the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight,negative
after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth,negative
i have never liked john carpenter and his style,negative
after seeing this film my opinions have not changed,negative
john carpenter remains john carpenter,negative
however because of the films selfirony black humour and fascinating cinematography i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long long time,negative
neither the synopses or carpenters direction are original,negative
but there are some things that are interesting,negative
the directors negative view on the catholic church for instance,negative
at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba maximilian schell has simply used crow and his team to find valek so that he would gain eternal life,negative
otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool drinking smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy,negative
carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere,negative
set in new mexican dessert he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness,negative
more than anything in this film this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil,negative
the cinematography by gary b kibbe is probably the films greatest achievement,negative
music composed by john carpenter himself is at times effective the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice,negative
when it comes to the cast in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem everyone can scream and swing the axe but here james woods is suprisingly convincing,negative
he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter who lost his family to the breed of evil,negative
woods is constantly overacting which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance,negative
daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crows loyal partner,negative
the other cast members are struggling,negative
because the film doesnt take itself too seriously it stays afloat,negative
still it is like most vampirefilms a mediocre experience,negative
you damn dirty apes,negative
thats just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes thats taken on a comedic context over time,negative
no one back then seemed to realize how overthe top charlton hestons acting style was but it shows now particularly in this mystery science theater 3000 wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time actually winning one oscar for makeup no less and being nominated for a couple others,negative
it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes escape from the planet of the apes return of the planet of the apes beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes planet of the apes the next generation police academy of the apes,negative
the list goes on,negative
heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth,negative
the thing is on this planet humans cant talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species,negative
hestons companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned,negative
he surprises them all with his gift of speech making two primate scientists roddy mcdowall and kim hunter believe heston is the missing link between ape and man,negative
believe me we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years,negative
when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans it is received as heresy for all good monkeys know god created ape in his image,negative
but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president,negative
and he takes them there holding up a baby doll and yelling if humans couldnt speak then how do you account for this talking doll,negative
and how do you account for your acting ability mr heston,negative
the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movies surprise conclusion,negative
i wont reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling god damn you all to hell,negative
several times in succession,negative
the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them,negative
what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution,negative
but let me tell you if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges heston to female ape may i kiss you before i go,negative
ape but,negative
youre so,negative
ugly hed convert to creationism on the spot,negative
luckily for us sciencefiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good,negative
the film may be called mercury rising but that title doesnt describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture a routine thriller that combines government coverups with a cloying and poorlymotivated buddy story,negative
the hook that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic,negative
however aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device,negative
those expecting to see even a semithorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed,negative
mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism,negative
the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard toswallow,negative
i dont know whether the problem is in the original book simple simon or in the screenplay adaptation but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible,negative
once again certain standby plot elements the highlevel government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent are recycled and not to good effect,negative
while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense,negative
the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold art jeffries bruce willis is confronted with his own failure,negative
unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death,negative
the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavyhandedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9year old simon lynch miko hughes when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player,negative
soon art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time with the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player always just a step behind them,negative
along the way they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy chi mcbride and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest kim dickens,negative
why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player,negative
apparently the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultrasecret code called mercury,negative
to make sure it cant be cracked they do the most intuitive thing possible place a sample of it in a nerds puzzle magazine,negative
of course no one can solve it no one except autistic simon that is,negative
when he calls the phone number listed in the solution he gets the nsa,negative
as a result the coldhearted sneering government man alec baldwin decides that simon has to be eliminated for the good of the country of course,negative
but he hasnt counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold even though everyone in the audience has,negative
its hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesnt do anything exceptionally well and does quite a few things rather poorly,negative
for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from timetotime but even the most exciting scenes such as the one where art and simon are crouched down avoiding passing trains arent that pulsepounding,negative
the climactic struggle is a real hohum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness,negative
overall director harold becker is constantly struggling and failing to generate even a moment that isnt derivative or obligatory,negative
bruce willis star seems to be fading,negative
this is his fourth straight lackluster outing following last man standing the fifth element and the jackal,negative
willis isnt terrible but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through and often does,negative
alec baldwin combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice does some scenery chewing but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace,negative
the films real star is young miko hughes heather langenkamps son in wes cravens new nightmare who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual but is about 50 years younger,negative
mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain the replacement killers and u s marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers,negative
for those who like action and adventure in the theater this has not been a good year,negative
hopefully the advent of summer will change that,negative
until then the best choices for bruce willis or any other action hero are on video,negative
and if youre determined to see mercury rising check out the morning sky in early may,negative
the animal is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling,negative
its clunky and slow like watching an 18wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill,negative
there are certainly better things you can do with your time,negative
actually if youve seen the trailer then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments,negative
the story centers on bland marvin rob schneider who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer,negative
but hes afflicted with loseritis,negative
dogs attack him neighbors torment him children bully him and his coworkers ignore him,negative
truthfully with his bad haircut seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic little richard and giant poodles and his unenthusiastic demeanor wed probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun,negative
this is actually bad because you cant like a character if you cant develop sympathy for him,negative
we never do and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor,negative
however marvin is found by an eccentric doctor michael caton who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs,negative
as a result marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed,negative
he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body swim with the speed of a dolphin and can run as fast as a cheetah,negative
imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation,negative
with his enhanced abilities he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him,negative
however the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn and instead marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic sexual urges,negative
goats beware,negative
he also chases cats urinates to mark his territory or growls at his enemies,negative
what he shouldve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich,negative
equally tenuous is its other running joke which involves one of his friends guy torry who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because hes black,negative
its reverse racism he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything,negative
this element doesnt work the first time its mentioned and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence,negative
you dont have to be as wise as an owl to realize that the animal is tame,negative
if theres any reason to see this film its to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut,negative
remember her,negative
she was voted off in week 11 of the 13week program survivor,negative
here she plays marvins sunny love interest,negative
while her role required very little actual acting she seemed very comfortable even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog yuck,negative
with her adorable disposition radiant smile and playful innocence she could be a meg ryan in the making,negative
its too bad that shes in such a mediocre offering,negative
arriving in a barrage of hype the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year,negative
however like the golden child although blair witch has made a lot of money its not very good,negative
donahue williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth,negative
the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles,negative
although events start of normal they get weird pretty quickly while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on,negative
although an interesting premise the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity,negative
the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise,negative
most of the dialogue is adlibbed and still manages to sound like a poor bmovie,negative
the script eventually degenerates into shouting matches with the fword included a lot to sound like students,negative
there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur but then its back to the shouting and swearing which gets very tiresome very quickly,negative
if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods shout a lot and swear id go on scout camp,negative
but no the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this but im not quite sure how,negative
the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes,negative
with no music and no budget to work with the film has to depend on natural psychological scares which are sometimes well delivered sometimes not,negative
i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film,negative
however because the actors are so irritating the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the f ck is that,negative
a lot and mike giggling like a loony,negative
theres also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things,negative
the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment and are hopelessly lost heather still insists on filming it all,negative
the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this but it isnt very convincing,negative
also the students have no idea how to survive in the woods such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation,negative
there are also some parts where the amateur camcorder footage is obviously staged heathers apology being a major one,negative
the blair witch project in the end just fails to deliver,negative
i suppose if youve been lost camping before the film may deliver some chills but this is no use for the other 99 of the paying audience who havent been lost in the woods,negative
apart from the final minutes the film is mind boggingly unscary and the shouting matches get hideously dull,negative
the spook scenes are short and far between and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide,negative
although a good idea its not executed well enough to be a fun scary cinema experience,negative
its a worrying fact when the website http www blairwitch com,negative
is better than the film,negative
darren jason biggs wayne steve zahn and j d jack black have been best friends since the fifth grade,negative
like the three musketeers theyve been together through thick and thin,negative
but when darren meets an attractive but coldblooded and manipulative psychiatrist judith amanda peet the long time friendship is placed in danger,negative
its up to wayne and j d to rescue their best friend in saving silverman,negative
silverman has its heart in the right place but the story by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darrens soul,negative
based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake the story is centered on the three life long amigos,negative
when wayne introduces darren to judith he doesnt realize that he has opened a pandoras box of disaster for himself and j d judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match,negative
since then she has sought a new mate someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision,negative
enter darren silverman,negative
once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement wayne and j d try everything they can including threats and bribery to get judith to free darren,negative
nothing works until the duo come up with a plan kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only pretty sandy perkus amanda detmer,negative
the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun,negative
things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j d play cupid,negative
the boys even bring their idol neil diamond into the picture to help resolve things,negative
thinking about it this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black,negative
the pair is able to elicit the films only laughs with their goofy antics and childlike behavior,negative
they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task,negative
steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne the brains of the gang,negative
jack black has the bigguy moves of a chris farley giving j d an amusing physical presence,negative
the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material,negative
the rest of the cast doesnt fare as well though,negative
jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do though having watched his previous films american pie and loser im not sure what attraction biggs actually has,negative
amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith,negative
there is no humanity at all to her character as she singlemindedly strives to recreate darren into her minds image,negative
shes a monster that wayne and j d must defeat to save their friend,negative
unfortunately there is no dimension to her character,negative
amanda detmer brings nothing or gets nothing as darrens one and only,negative
r lee ermey as the psychotic coach made a bad decision taking this role,negative
tunemeister neil diamond gives a goodnatured cameo perf as the boys idol and savior,negative
production values are on par with the rest of the film lackluster and noninvolving,negative
director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like big daddy and beverly hills ninja but falls flat with saving silverman,negative
the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a good film to sink our teeth into,negative
at least with saving silverman we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black,negative
too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor,negative
kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy,negative
i give it a c,negative
ill be the first to admit it,negative
when you mention the book great expectations i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch,negative
yes its a classic of literature but it was a rather dry one shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine,negative
certainly the experience wasnt truly that bad but to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book im not going to tell the story the way it happened ill,negative
gonna tell it the way i remember it,negative
anyway to return from nostalgia lane and get back to the present hollywood in its trendy attempt to modernize the classics now presents an updated film version of great expectations,negative
instead of pip this time the central character is named finn played as a boy by jeremy kissner and by ethan hawke as an adult,negative
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie or should that be mrs joe kim dickens and her boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper,negative
the setting is the florida coast during the mid70s,negative
finn is a blooming artist and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish one of his two favorite subjects,negative
during one of these escapades he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal robert deniro,negative
borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady deniros criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity and favors hiding on the ocean floor,negative
ok maybe,negative
thats an exaggeration but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the film,negative
and thats nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finns motorboat but i digress,negative
anyway finn does the convict a good deed just to show that hes a really swell guy,negative
and then the plot moves on,negative
enter miss havisham or,negative
ms dinsmoor here anne bancroft,negative
abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago ms dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid,negative
with bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role,negative
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character she does add some humor to the film,negative
joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner but the insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece estella raquel beaudene as a young girl gwyneth paltrow as an adult,negative
for no apparent reason other than to provide the main plot of the film finn is instantly stricken for the estella,negative
perhaps its her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before,negative
in any case neither as children nor adults chemistry simply doesnt exist between the two and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her,negative
even when as an adult finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor reacquaints himself with estella and draws her portrait in the nude theres nothing,negative
in fact there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnears gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets,negative
at this point the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character and couldnt care less about the two characters,negative
the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow,negative
she fails to imbue estella a remote character in the book with even the vaguest traces of humanity,negative
theres obviously something wrong when watching the film youre more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character,negative
without a strong estella finns obsession seems baseless,negative
you wish he would just stop whining let estella marry his rival walter plane an oddly subdued hank azaria and just get on with his life,negative
in fact the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot,negative
finns relationship with his brotherinlaw joe is interesting if a bit stereotypical,negative
whats more fascinating are his interactions with deniro,negative
although its only a bit part it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create,negative
it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film,negative
some of the shots work but others are too obviously staged for example both of the water fountain scenes to have any impact,negative
finns art actually the creations of italian painter francesco clemente is used throughout the film but it mostly fails to have the intended effect,negative
we never see why finn would generate this style of art which is simultaneously crude and insightful,negative
as a result it ends up as distant as the rest of the film,negative
modernizing the classics is currently in vogue just see william shakespeares romeojuliet,negative
simply update the action to a modern setting and apply plenty of modern rock,negative
but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations,negative
as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it youd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film,negative
according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers isolated motels diners gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers,negative
at the beginning of eye of the storm 1991 german american thriller directed by yuri zeltser one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up,negative
ten years later their son steven played by bradley gregg who was blinded during the incident still runs motel together with his older brother ray played by craig sheffer,negative
hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone played by dennis hopper gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra played by lara flynn boyle,negative
their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed,negative
yuri zeltser author of this film was obviously inspired by hitchcocks psycho but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot,negative
instead of norman bates we have two brothers one of them traumatised physically another mentally,negative
sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband,negative
eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere,negative
the acting is fine hopper gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine,negative
unfortunately eye of the storm which was supposed to be intense psychological drama deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale,negative
in the end this film reminds us that original approach cant prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities,negative
special note to the profiler fans ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killers girlfriend,negative
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as anywhere but here,negative
there isnt one thing about this motherdaughter relationship melodrama that felt honest,negative
it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives as for some reason they couldnt figure it out for themselves,negative
if the film looks familiar that is because the slums of beverly hills 98 went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with,negative
alvin sargents script was weak and annoyingly claustral,negative
wayne wangs the joy luck club inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldnt convey,negative
pushy mother adele august susan sarandon forces her 14yearold daughter ann natalie portman to leave a small midwestern burg to go crosscountry with her to beverly hills,negative
the daughter resents her twice divorced unstable but exotic schoolteacher mother bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life,negative
the daqughter doesnt even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and cant stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio,negative
so it becomes a question of who knows best as the ladies fight it out between them until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner,negative
adeles dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesnt look that good as she lands a job in a slum school has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive,negative
daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there,negative
during one of many arguments with her freespirited mom they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed she runs away only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop michael milhoan who offers her wise counsel,negative
with the cops zen wisdom passed onto the daughter she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla,negative
during their stay in beverly hills she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer a t s,negative
eliot corbin allred reader,negative
but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality as everything seemed staged and unemotional,negative
when she learns her cousin benny shawn hatosy who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasnt clearly shown why she wants to stay there and for that matter it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly,negative
the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams,negative
i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one able to recognize mothers faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself,negative
mother has a series of setbacks like being dumped by her dreamboat dentist bochner she met on the beach and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part,negative
but mother learns that her daughter has grownup and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her,negative
she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do,negative
this of course results in the corny ending showing that moms heart was always in the right place only she went about it in the wrong way,negative
this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing,negative
a cop with a troubled personal life,negative
a ruthless villain,negative
a friend of the cop,negative
a dead friend of the cop,negative
a quest for vengeance,negative
a new partner,negative
a romantic interest,negative
a chase scene,negative
a chase scene in san francisco,negative
a woman in peril,negative
a confrontation,negative
an explosion,negative
the end,negative
yawn,negative
yawn,negative
yawn,negative
the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films this one just happens to be called metro,negative
i have learned to expect little from films like metro and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed,negative
with eddie murphy on board however you hope for something extra some kind of spark,negative
when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience you know it is doing something terribly wrong,negative
murphy stars as scott roper a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job,negative
with his personal life he is considerably less successful facing an unhappy exgirlfriend named veronica carmen ejogo a gambling problem and a mountain of debt,negative
then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague art evans is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda michael wincott,negative
finding korda becomes very personal to scott and he joins with new partner kevin mccall michael rappaport to foil korda during an attempted heist,negative
but all is not well even with korda in jail as scott veronica and kevin all continue to face lifethreatening danger,negative
metro the title in case you are wondering means absolutely nothing is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads,negative
in the first place kordas rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway and incidentally to screw it up,negative
a reference to payoffs in the police department followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about fortyfive minutes even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott that you may yearn for bickering buddies,negative
worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain the always menacing michael wincott behind bars for far too long leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica,negative
you cant blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady but he should have known better than to take this role at all,negative
scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of streetwise fasttalker murphy has built a career on and an actual threedimensional character and murphy is never able to reconcile the two,negative
the script seems to have been doctored for him with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with,negative
for much of the film he walks around with an intense frown and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time,negative
murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply,negative
i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill and doing a few interesting things with it,negative
as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation,negative
carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense standby the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone and using it to defuse tension not once but twice,negative
the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches and a willingness to subvert them makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling,negative
an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out point c while theyre still getting to point b or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen,negative
and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners not rating anything lower than your standard this movie sucks along comes this cinematic atrocity and hes forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick even the bravest moviegoer would think twice about seeing this waste of time,negative
yes despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie the latest highlander doesnt seem to have anything going for it,negative
oh stinky movie let me count thee ways,negative
plot from what i understood a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal or,negative
something along those lines,negative
critique a complete and utter mess,negative
disjointed incoherent boring corny filled with bad dialogue and,negative
thats just the first thirty minutes,negative
this film doesnt seem to know what to do with itself,negative
its confusing to anyone who doesnt know the series i include myself in that group and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series i include diehard highlander fan the arrow in that group,negative
the film doesnt explain anything about itself it,negative
just goes from one inexplicable situation to another,negative
one moment theyre in the present time the next moment theyre in italy in the 1600s,negative
why,negative
who knows,negative
what are they talking about,negative
no idea,negative
flashbacks mixed in with the present mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene,negative
hullo,negative
confused yet,negative
i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story,negative
random swordplay mad maxlike dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s,negative
or were they in the present at that time,negative
who knows and to be honest who,negative
seriously cares,negative
this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago but sadly someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it,negative
please please for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of moviemaking and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film put this series to bed and end it,negative
even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one,negative
the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material but all he could come up with is plenty of slomo action some fastmotion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere,negative
and is there anything spectacular about the swordplay or fight scenes,negative
nope,negative
and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face closeups yipes,negative
the man is not aging gracefully is he,negative
oh boy and i havent even gotten around to the greatest piece of overacting that ive seen in years,negative
the man who plays kell in this movie bruce payne should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near,negative
overacting is not a hobby for this guy its,negative
a living,negative
hes also very funny not purposely though,negative
all in all the movie stinks,negative
nuff said,negative
are you like me,negative
do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places shouting out loud not giving a ratts ass about anyone around them and basically just wallowing in their own selfimportance,negative
well if you are than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half only to make up and hug in the end,negative
aaaaaaaahhhh,negative
plot three grownup sisters living their own separate lives begin to reestablish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill,negative
critique this would be a good movie if it wasnt for the fact that its got very little to say features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any thirdrate afterschool special,negative
and im being nice,negative
how junk like this gets made is beyond me but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit,negative
the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryans character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot,negative
wow how,negative
deep,negative
of course the same christmas tune thats played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background while characters continue to build bonds among one another by making reference to old quaint movies or movie stars,negative
stop me im,negative
gonna cry again,negative
this film is a mess,negative
the characters are boring and irritating to watch the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot kind of liking their father but not really and then finally realizing the error of their ways while sharing an emotional moment about movie stars from the 50s,negative
admittedly i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film,negative
meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot looking as adorable as ever but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single show that shes in,negative
enough already,negative
and diane keaton mustve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one cause her acting was amateurish at best,negative
neither one convinced in emotional scenes,negative
granted they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and thats probably where my rating of three points comes from,negative
all in all this movie is not funny unless youre one to chuckle at train wrecks provides zero drama unless you consider loud phone conversations moving generates absolutely no emotion although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine and ends on a perfectly pretentious note oh no please dont get any flour on my donna karan dress,negative
ugh,negative
i suggest that all ladies take their to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something,negative
thatll teach em to mess with you,negative
oh and incidentally mrs joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind so there,negative
then again maybe,negative
youll like it,negative
if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a latenight cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80s theyd agree d c cab is the quintessential usa up all nite movie,negative
its one of those childish rrated movies that kids would love but cant see until its edited for tv,negative
its also one of those pointless almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs,negative
and strike three it pairs mr t with gary busey,negative
i heard gilbert say d c cab had an allstar cast but im still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement,negative
when thirdbilling goes to a twominute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara as herself you cant say a damn thing about allstar casts,negative
likewise for token appearances by marsha roz warfield paul rodriguez and politically incorrect host bill maher before he was somebody,negative
appearing in d c cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else especially irene im gonna live forever cara,negative
d c cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher who would go on to direct batman forever about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs,negative
you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice this would be the result except here you have such interesting characters as the token white guy busey who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world the token jive talker named tyrone charlie barnett who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word honkey as much as possible the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains mr t a real stretch for him the aspiring musician waiting for his big break maher the mexican gigolo rodriguez the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living warfield and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living adam baldwin,negative
weve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80s,negative
some are fun to watch and some are actually funny,negative
this one is more or less neither,negative
youd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent whatever but d c cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him,negative
its a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality,negative
d c cab has rightly earned its position on usa up all nite,negative
warning spoilers are included in this review,negative
but it doesnt really make much of a difference,negative
deep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of 1997,negative
remember when dantes peak came out in february,negative
a few months later volcano was released,negative
the first film was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen,negative
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent,negative
well its deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition,negative
this time unfortunately the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming cometdisaster to be released the beginning of july,negative
of course the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine and so i am in the minority as i was when i stood on the side of dantes peak,negative
but while watching deep impact i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film,negative
apparently many did and it utterly baffles me,negative
to be completely honest i havent had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life,negative
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo but it was still rather fun to watch,negative
deep impact doesnt just have implausibilities it also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and a poorly constructed plot,negative
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters,negative
deep impact begins in an unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets it in the future but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater pushing it back to 1993,negative
a line of students is outside at night peering through telescopes at the dark sky above,negative
among these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski,negative
leo unknowingly discovers a comet and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds,negative
he races off to mail the information but is killed in a reckless car accident,negative
a year passes and nothing is heard about it again,negative
we are then introduced to jenny lerner t a leoni a reporter for msnbc,negative
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible coverup in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell,negative
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie,negative
after talking with rittenhouse and unsatisfied with the information she gets she decides to use the internet for help,negative
luckily she knows exactly how to spell the certain ellie that she is looking for they spell it ele in the film,negative
that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled,negative
before she can use the information the government decides to push her car off the road,negative
they take her in to meet the president of the united states president beck morgan freeman,negative
beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference,negative
naturally she wants to be compensated and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question,negative
and so yada yada yada they reveal the comet to the public and their plans send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive,negative
they announce a plan called ark which is their only hope for survival,negative
a computer will select 800 000 people at random,negative
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet wont kill off the entire human race,negative
after two years the dust will settle actually it would take much much longerapproximately ninety years from what i understand and the humans could come back to the surface and start over,negative
the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures but there is one subplot worth mentioning,negative
jenny and her father jason maximilian schell have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom,negative
the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional,negative
its a shame that nothing else is heartfelt,negative
now of course we all know that the comet does impact the surface,negative
the title alone suggests it and the previews actually show it,negative
by doing this absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it wont work,negative
director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show er,negative
her major film debut was the peacemaker a pathetic and heartless action film,negative
well this time leder outdid herself creating a film worse than that one,negative
suggestion to ms leder please stay away from the big screen or at least the action genre,negative
much of the blame can be placed on leder directly because the pace is disastrously off,negative
throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed it goes from months to weeks to hours,negative
it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in realtimeits that boring,negative
of course leder isnt all to blame for it,negative
screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time,negative
what starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway,negative
chock full of cheesy one liners you know you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school,negative
and stupid characters you might think we were back in the 70s again,negative
only one of the subplots is remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring,negative
and the main plot is so outrageous that you cant figure out if this film is supposed to be an action drama or scifi,negative
to put it simply the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation,negative
thats right 80 miss and 20 hit,negative
scenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship is majestic,negative
but the comet is a huge mistake making it more laughable than frightening,negative
the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough but thats forgiveable,negative
what isnt forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface,negative
give me a break will ya,negative
and of course the much hyped collision of comet and earth,negative
well it is far from spectacular and it makes independence day look brilliant,negative
the water rushing towards the land is effective but once it hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous,negative
cgi water is used and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks,negative
in fact i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days,negative
just when we think visual effects cant be improved along comes a film to show that they really can and should be,negative
one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leders direction which also influences the actors,negative
leder loves to show the actors faces before and during moments of terror,negative
this reminded me of another action director renny harlin die hard 2 cliffhanger,negative
but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations,negative
leder likes to flaunt peoples fears via their faces but instead of coming off as sympathetic leder seems more of a sadist,negative
one moment has an astronaut flying off into space,negative
this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience but leder wants to go farther and shows us the persons face while drifting into space,negative
this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience and i for one am not going to be fooled,negative
on another note leders film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts,negative
the pace does pick up and some very emotional moments are shown,negative
then again when you watch people cry for their loved ones its obvious it will be emotional,negative
its mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into feeling for the characters but it didnt work for me,negative
but anyway the actors do as much as they can with what they are given,negative
t a leoni bad boys tvs the naked truth is the best of the film and she is given the meatiest role,negative
her character is made stronger by leonis presence and we grow to care for her,negative
robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch but his character is turned into shreds by the plot,negative
elijah wood also comes off rather successfully but he still hasnt had many good roles wood stick to drama,negative
you are too talented for this stuff,negative
vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen,negative
maximilian schell is distracting but he does provide some nice humor,negative
morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one of his most shallow performances to date which is quite remarkable for him,negative
leelee sobieski could have been better but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character,negative
a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby,negative
eldard is good in his role but is limited by the plot,negative
crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tvs star trek the next generation,negative
seeing her was one of the highlights of the film,negative
overall a very talented cast virtually wasted,negative
deep impact is rated pg13 for disaster related elements and brief language,negative
this is one of the worst films of the year and if it is any omen of things to come this summer could be one of the worst ever,negative
luckily the xfiles movie is coming up and hopefully armageddon will be more successful,negative
its a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isnt worth much,negative
costing nearly 75 million with special effects done by the illustrious ilm which is a huge shocker and with a score composed by oscarwinner james horner titanic one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience,negative
well its not,negative
when the comet does hit the earth you almost wish it could just take this film along with it,negative
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes,negative
alas it refers to our heroes,negative
as it turns out the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth via the mir space station thinks of the human race as a virus perhaps even a cancer that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further,negative
after all we have taken up this entire planet and if they let us live for another billion years or so we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one,negative
but the human race doesnt have much to worry about,negative
after all theres a woman named foster jamie lee curtis out there stopping the computer virus,negative
shes the chief navigator on a sea vessel travelling with her is captain everton donald sutherland steve baker william baldwin woods marshall bell squeaky julio oscar mechoso and richie sherman augustus,negative
theyre all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters,negative
lucky for us we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board,negative
the evil captain everton thinks hes going to take the ship in and get a reward he convinces his crew that theres going to be big money so they try to salvage the ship,negative
soon however when its apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power they realize that something bad must have happened,negative
finally they meet nadia joanna pacula who explains their situation a computer virus has taken over the ship,negative
its creating biomechanical lifeforms to eliminate the human race,negative
virus is a truly dumb action thriller one of negligible intelligence and innovation,negative
when considering the entire film you will realize that it lacks a single original scene,negative
its a direct ripoff of nearly every james cameron film aliens the abyss and the terminator films are the most plagiarized more importantly its basically the same movie as last years deep rising,negative
i liked deep rising simply because its funny it knows its silly and derivative,negative
virus takes itself seriously,negative
and in the most serious manner possible it steals from every good and bad film of the genre showing you countless familiar scenes and sporting a cookiecutter plot that any film of the sci genre could fit with a little trimming,negative
but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out,negative
okay let me get this straight the alien race which is never really explained is basically sentient electricity,negative
they need to make themselves physical so they use a space station to get onto a ship which is surrounded by water but who cares about that,negative
on the ship they make a bunch of clunky immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people,negative
after that they start using the dead people to create halfhuman halfmachine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around,negative
the leader of course is a big creature,negative
every film like this has a big creature at the end but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around,negative
virus is indeed a cliched film but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isnt very threatening,negative
its established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there,negative
on one level virus is almost passable fun,negative
its really gory and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal the director john bruno worked on a lot of camerons films,negative
theres also a nice array of actors even though none of them do any acting except for donald sutherland who does a lot of very bad acting,negative
the bottom line however is this virus is a bad movie,negative
it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing,negative
in that order i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes,negative
there was probably a good reason that the warner bros studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened,negative
and after seeing this piece of toxic waste i now know why,negative
this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago,negative
fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in gods country somewhere in eastern kentucky,negative
its beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate kris kristopherson who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role,negative
it turns out that hes filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit,negative
seagal plays jack taggert an aikidoversed fighting machine who is an agent with the epa,negative
no not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa,negative
its the environmental protection agency,negative
i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers,negative
taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice,negative
written by someone named jeb i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships banjopicking preachers and dumbasnails rednecks,negative
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in,negative
seagals idea of a disguise is a longlength 1000 leather jacket,negative
but to get closer to the kinfolk he will fix peoples porches for free,negative
thats another great epa asset teaching agents how to fix porches,negative
slow and plodding this project is a total mess,negative
the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige,negative
here his bravado basically turns into bullyness,negative
townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued,negative
fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever,negative
and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes,negative
the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony gets behind the pulpit and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment,negative
but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping kristopherson meets up with seagal,negative
kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away,negative
seagal gallantly replies ill leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth,negative
i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background,negative
this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagals righteousness and narcissistic arrogance,negative
seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace that of the envirothriller on deadly ground,negative
however the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this,negative
still i believe in preserving mother earth so save your 5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity,negative
a movie like mortal kombat annihilation works and must be reviewed on multiple levels,negative
first theres the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie,negative
but occasionaly almost as if making an ironic selfdepreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery,negative
no no,negative
just kidding,negative
had you going there for a moment didnt i,negative
in all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoints that of a movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of a fan of the first movie a fan of the games,negative
the first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and its 5 billion inhabitants,negative
the mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth,negative
unfortunately shao khan was a poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet as our heroes assumed a fighting stance,negative
the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game,negative
id even go so far as to say that many folks who didnt know about the game probably enjoyed the movie,negative
the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didnt try to overachieve,negative
there were a lot of really cool fight scenes with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately nonintrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot,negative
and as we know the movie was a smashing success at the box office,negative
mortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie,negative
shao khan has decided that hes going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament,negative
thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid,negative
one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a real movie now,negative
too bad they didnt simply stick with the formula from the first movie,negative
i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture but here are the high points,negative
the acting is truly bad,negative
sandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie,negative
in one of the worst pieces of miscasting i think ive ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder,negative
in the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics,negative
i generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the u s in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but hes so totally wrong for this part that he doesnt even have the luxury of amused selfawareness,negative
there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again,negative
there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including a muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has a mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva,negative
for these reasons and many others i can only give the movie a 2,negative
unless youre a huge fan of the games the first movie,negative
in that case the following critiques also apply,negative
sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as a fighter,negative
wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer,negative
hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together a much more believable fight scene,negative
in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more,negative
sonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on,negative
a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely,negative
there arent as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between,negative
silly silly folks,negative
and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mudwrestling match,negative
lame and so obviously sexist even i politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it,negative
the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animalities,negative
motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie,negative
for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games i give this a 5,negative
youll probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one,negative
after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy i was ready for some mindless funoh maybe something like tango cash,negative
maybe not,negative
mindless fun is one thing but braindead slop is another matter altogether,negative
tango cash has lowest common denominator written all over it,negative
the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l a russell plays cash a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts,negative
stallone plays tango a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it he doesnt need the money,negative
in an effort to change his image stallone goes for a yuppie gq look in the film wearing spectacles and three piece suits,negative
the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names,negative
tango cash is unbearably noisy,negative
for starters theres harold faltermeyers annoying synthesized score which gets old after four notes,negative
to make matters worse the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars the more the merrier,negative
in fact the movie begins with not one but two car chases,negative
theres nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie,negative
screenwriter randy feldmans brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv,negative
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it such as stallones efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual,negative
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligentand stallone is no lawrence olivier,negative
its hard to imagine anyone reading feldmans script and thinking i want to be in this movie,negative
the films plot doesnt have one original bone in its body andagainyou have to point your finger at the screenwriting,negative
feldmans story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book making tango cash altogether generic and predictable,negative
they simply could have called it action movie,negative
every character every twist and turn is stolen from television or from other movies,negative
adding insult to injury tango cash is about as believable as a road runner cartoon,negative
action movies dont have to be realistic but they should absorb you enough so that youre not thinking about the lack of realism,negative
the only artistic aspect of tango cash is the cinematography,negative
there are some spectacular shots especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires,negative
the films main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell,negative
unfortunately their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants,negative
the dialogue consists of nothing but oneliners and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing,negative
its a shame because with a workable screenplay russell and stallone could have turned tango cash into a charming lethal weaponesque adventure,negative
tango cash tries to maintain a light tone and you do laugh about once every five minutes,negative
seeing russell in drag is the movies funniest moment but you probably already have seen it in the commercials,negative
furthermore the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence,negative
machine guns and torture generally dont mix well with comedy,negative
jack palance appears in tango cash doing what he does best playing a sleazy conniving villain,negative
his character however is runofthemill except for his strange obsession with mice,negative
like many movie villains palance likes to play games,negative
in fact he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room,negative
you have to wonder why palance doesnt just shoot the detectives in the head,negative
the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent,negative
teri hatcher plays stallones sister and russells loveinterest and she is just as pretty as can be,negative
but regrettably hatchers acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty,negative
every time she opens her mouth you cringe corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination,negative
theres really very little if anything to recommend in the film,negative
and more to the point tango definitely isnt worth a penny of your cashso dont bother,negative
bats is this years camp flick,negative
with the worlds worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity,negative
as for the rest of us well,negative
id say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway,negative
follow their lead and youll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot,negative
i love alfred hitchcocks the birds almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based,negative
it saddens me even more then to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe such as bats,negative
when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town the authorities call in a batologist dina meyer to investigate,negative
it turns out that a creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious,negative
why has he done this you ask,negative
because you see it is apparently a scientists job to make things a little better even if that means the death of all mankind,negative
so the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have to kill all the bats and save the world,negative
of course that cant happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture,negative
consider for example a scene where two people are in a bat cave,negative
the bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out,negative
what do they do,negative
do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can,negative
nope,negative
they stand there for a while transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes,negative
what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes,negative
we dont even get to see whats going on the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick,negative
all we know is that bats are attacking,negative
how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery,negative
a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some,negative
of course director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor but it is so conventional it doesnt really go anywhere,negative
most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologists wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like i hate bats,negative
some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept,negative
i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame oneliners,negative
playing such characters does not help actors careers,negative
still i suppose that if youre looking for a movie that is so bad its good you could do worse than bats,negative
it does have a tremendous amount of camp value,negative
im not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it,negative
more power to them,negative
be gentle urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in the whole nine yards,negative
i havent made love in five years,negative
neither have i rebuts perry,negative
im married,negative
if jonathan lynns latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliberand it certainly triesthen itd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film,negative
instead its failings go much deeper,negative
first off who hasnt had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre,negative
if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a comedy which pairs a robert de willis type with a billy perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in,negative
whos next,negative
jack nicholson and martin short,negative
it certainly doesnt have to be funny,negative
the whole nine yards is not a particularly funny film but it is borderline offensive,negative
offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldnt think twice about pushing your motherinlaw off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete,negative
that might sound like a funny sight gag but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isnt all that funny to begin with,negative
when the corpse is placed in a car doused with gasoline set ablaze and referred to as barbecue it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end,negative
the whole nine yards is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects,negative
rosanna arquette plays a slutty chainsmoking french canadian whos married to matthew perrys nonetoosuccessful dentist,negative
its an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfitsand unflattering situationsinto which arquette is thrust,negative
then theres natasha henstridge species i and ii who plays the welltodo wife of contract killer bruce willis,negative
she gets involved with perrys character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finders fee with mob boss yanni gogolack kevin pollack transposing his vs with his ws after willis jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door,negative
henstridge and perrys characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together,negative
perry might have the charm but he doesnt have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man especially in closeup,negative
most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet who turns in a sexuallyripe performance as perrys dental assistant with it transpires questionable career goals,negative
peets gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off,negative
when my cousin vinny is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as clue greedy and sgt,negative
bilko you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path,negative
perrys pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with and a director who seems to be watching from the wings their characters run out of gas quickly,negative
this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled bluecollar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times,negative
it is hard to tell what is independent about this film it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam,negative
it is the debut film for the director who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s where the mindset of all the characters depicted is grounded but to see it in the 1990s is a different story it is old news,negative
the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesnt mean much since their relationship remained undeveloped,negative
the introduction of the wiseguy angle and the loyality among buddies bit are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tourdeforce performance by the star of the film adrien brody as ray,negative
ray is the only son of a lowlevel mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield new jersey suburban basement,negative
ray sr vincent is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale homerepair business,negative
his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his longtime waitress girlfriend joanne sybil,negative
the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman10b which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film you,negative
should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that dont make sense its constant brainless chatter between the buddies their uneventful growing pains and the despair of their lives make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them,negative
desperate to make his dream come through ray goes to a loanshark humorously and menacingly played by james e moriarty and borrows 10 grand to bet on a sure thing at freehold raceway,negative
the horse loses and now ray has big problems as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough,negative
there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray,negative
he is undependable meanspirited and stupid,negative
so when his best friend mike gallagher the narrator of the film gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriendwho cares,negative
the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do,negative
as for rays gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen,negative
his buddies the college student mike and the dependable butchie gillan and his old man who he has this relationship with rally to his aid,negative
and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together,negative
there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star,negative
because of his intensity and looks he reminds me of sean penn,negative
i have a confession,negative
even though i am a movie junkiei saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch moviesive never seen any of the original godzillas,negative
note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u s godzilla released in 1998 its the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira nisen mireniamu,negative
so part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000the latest entry in an almost 50year old franchise,negative
this was a longawaited treat,negative
i was expecting a goofy good time complete with bad dubbing science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line,negative
the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so boring,negative
i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt,negative
you do get all of the so bad theyre good traits so normally associated with the franchise,negative
but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot,negative
its a deal i wasnt willing to accept,negative
hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimuras script crams in way too many details and in many cases fails to follow up on them,negative
the maneuver is not only disconcerting but gives the movie a permanent logy weighty feel,negative
godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops,negative
was it a whim,negative
a bold political statement,negative
i dont know,negative
its foe an ancient meteor that looks like prudentials logo doesnt just fight the beast from the far east,negative
no its got to have lifesaving powers a plot to erase the data from japan a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature,negative
theres a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit takehiro murata and a slimy government official hiroshi abe over the handling of godzilla and personal issues,negative
and then theres the plucky news photographer and blah blah blah,negative
its like watching magnolia all over againexcept without the good writing keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs,negative
what a waste,negative
when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you godzilla 2000 does the jobits entertaining and goes down easy,negative
the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish,negative
the dubbing is nice and awful with murata sounding like hes in constant need of a cough drop,negative
as for the dialogue one line summarizes the goofiness factor did anyone see that flying rock go by,negative
this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that ive heard the word imbecile used in casual conversation,negative
though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments i wouldnt take kids to see it,negative
theyll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose,negative
american pie alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summers attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute coupleness and zany comedy,negative
its about an a student biggs as paul who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora suvari a ditzy heroinchic goth chick who has no ambition or selfrespect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like hickboy paul is,negative
so weve got a fishoutwater formula mixed with meetcute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie,negative
unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by clueless auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film,negative
these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable its as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver,negative
theres no background or details to anyone or anything its just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other,negative
not to mention the story itself which is virtually nonexistant and contains so many plotholes its like swiss cheese,negative
even the basic editing is bad,negative
if youre looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny,negative
i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all,negative
if youve seen the commericials youve seen all the funny parts which are all from the first five minutes,negative
the previews for the movie are pretty good,negative
they show a little plot all the characters and the emotional highlights all spliced together to give a general impression of the script,negative
unfortunately the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes,negative
the residents of mystery love hockey,negative
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football,negative
the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player whos guilty of shooting another man yes thats one of the movies jokes,negative
every saturday the best players pair off for a game and the whole town comes to watch,negative
the towns prodigal son charlie hank azaria wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated,negative
mysterys national fame has the town abuzz,negative
a week later charlie actually shows up in person and he brings with him an offer from the nhl,negative
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals,negative
the mysterians see this as both good and bad,negative
on the one hand theyd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition,negative
on the other hand they dont want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes,negative
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition,negative
biebe russell crowe has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys including his new replacement,negative
hes already resentful and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife,negative
crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film so hes just kind of stuck with constantly brooding,negative
charlie meanwhile is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a mans worth,negative
his gift of the feature story and of the new york rangers was his way of compensating for not being a better skater,negative
he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him,negative
burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans,negative
walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey but he actively tries to put it behind him,negative
he wants his son to take the game more seriously but he wants his community to just get over it,negative
reynolds could have been good but sloppy writing editing keep walter in the corner and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together,negative
one character actually was interesting,negative
biebes wife mary mccormack like the judge understood that there was more to life than hockey,negative
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community,negative
she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open,negative
her unique insight is verbalized once and it lasts only a scene before it is gone but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom,negative
mysterty alaska follows a handful of other characters but none are well developed or worth mentioning,negative
the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story no underlying thing that the movie is really about,negative
instead roach and screenwriters david e kelley and sean obyrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy,negative
they try to make you laugh and cry to feel outrage and pride,negative
they present the framing and cadence for jokes but theres nothing truly funny,negative
they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness but they give you nothing to be really sad about,negative
as columnist molly ivins would say its all hat no cattle,negative
the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about,negative
there is a funeral scene played with appropriate gravity and somber music,negative
it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide whats truly important,negative
russell crowe steps forward to speak about to spell out the movies metaphor for us,negative
he says that what really matters in life is community,negative
then adds and hockey,negative
i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear,negative
only mildly bad mystery alaska probably deserves 2 stars,negative
i even laughed out loud genuine laughs in places,negative
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers a friend of roach turned up in a role that didnt suit him,negative
myers is a comic character actor,negative
he puts on masks becomes an outrageous caricature and is funny,negative
hes great as austin powers dr evil or any of his scottish characters,negative
nobody else in mysterty alaska is a comic caricature,negative
all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semiserious roles,negative
for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast toward his audience and indeed toward the film itself,negative
its an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously,negative
dr dolittle 20th century fox running time 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor 1996 murphy returns in this abysmal comedy,negative
he plays doctor john dolittle who as a child had the ability to understand animals,negative
however after being exorcised he loses this ability and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people most notably dr mark weller played by oliver platt,negative
however with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns and comedy is ready and waiting to happen,negative
except comedy never does happen,negative
doctor dolittle even with the excellent premise rarely manages to raise a laugh,negative
poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie and his performance suffers,negative
the manic murphy we saw in the 80s is gone his more mature and more boring twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90s,negative
the voices of the animals which include albert brooks chris rock the new eddie murphy and norm mcdonald as lucky the dog are marginally better and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie,negative
sadly most of their lines are pretty dumb,negative
and theyre not funny dumb like dumb dumber 1994 but just boring dumb,negative
the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs,negative
there are a few good jokes in the script but they are few and far between,negative
if i had to choose a favourite performance it would probably be albert brooks tiger who has a certain charm about him,negative
sadly hes barely in the movie and rocks really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time,negative
joke wise we are thankfully spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor,negative
the director betty thomas has well done better films,negative
she bought us private parts 1997 and the brady bunch movie 1995 which were sadly much better than this,negative
the scenes lack any charm she just gets the job done,negative
the animals themselves are reasonable realistic although most of them are obviously puppets,negative
theres an impressive looking tiger however and the lip sync is pretty good,negative
youd have no problem guessing that most of the close ups are puppets however with their jilted movement,negative
i was hoping jim hensons workshop who created the furry friends would have done a better job,negative
doctor dolittle in the end is a disappointment for everyone involved,negative
murphy has done much better movies i e,negative
trading places the director has seen better days and even the creatures arent that good,negative
the target audience aged between 713 who are undemanding will probably like it however thanks to its dumbed down humour,negative
everyone else however should give doctor dolittle a miss,negative
for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues,negative
i would give it one half of a star for guts,negative
anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts,negative
i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show,negative
the script was the worst part,negative
they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh,negative
they had lots of great sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door,negative
turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show,negative
the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left,negative
buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies,negative
tell them the show is great and smile a lot,negative
one of the top few films of this or any year,negative
a must see film,negative
excellent show,negative
look for it,negative
average movie,negative
kind of enjoyable,negative
poor show,negative
dont waste your money,negative
0 one of the worst films of this or any year,negative
totally unbearable,negative
review written on september 29 1993,negative
opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employers,negative
the first image in final fantasy the spirits within is a computeranimated closeup of a human eye,negative
its a beautiful piece of work remarkably detailed and quite convincing,negative
when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye however things change,negative
the young woman has mesmerizing hair although it hangs too artfully even by movie standards to be believed,negative
the facial features are more detailed than any computeranimation seen to date but the result is more reminiscent of a very wellcrafted doll than anything human,negative
she is pretty but bland and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person,negative
all the characters in final fantasy are like that,negative
of the core group the younger white men and women are all athletic attractive and indistinct like applicants for a tv reality show,negative
the black man is taller and burlier and the aging scholar is bald with wrinkles and a beard,negative
none of them appear to be based on individuals they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist,negative
it gets worse when they talk and move,negative
why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll,negative
why for every fluid physical gesture do we also see herkyjerky puppetstyle motions,negative
more to the point who decided a fulllength computer animated movie featuring hyperreal their term not mine humanoids was a good idea,negative
final fantasy is based on a phenomenally popular video game ive never played with a story straight out of japanese anime which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed,negative
if youre a fan of either please spare me your letters as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials,negative
with an expressionchallenged cast final fantasy mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit,negative
the result is ugly confusing and boring,negative
note the following reveals the basic plot,negative
if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie i suggest you read it,negative
earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls,negative
most of our planet is devastated with humans living in a few protected cities,negative
while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies aki ross voiced by mingna and her mentor dr sid donald sutherland believe in a more organic approach,negative
they operate on the notion quoting straight from the press kit that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained,negative
aki and dr sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force,negative
the waves will in effect cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion,negative
they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave,negative
they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out,negative
are you still with me,negative
theres only a little more,negative
aki is infected with the alien force,negative
dr sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her but the defense wall wont hold much longer,negative
already the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams,negative
aiding aki and dr sid are the deep eyes a group of hardasnails types that would have felt at home with the troops in aliens,negative
capt gray edwards alec baldwin heads the task force that consists of a wise guy buscemi a tough woman peri gilpin and a gentle giant ving rhames,negative
throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass in this case general hein james woods who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age even if it destroys earth as well,negative
so there you have it,negative
like most of the anime ive seen the plot combines apocalyptic settings lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality all wrapped up in a savetheearth bow,negative
but im bored with apocalyptic settings,negative
i understand why so many liveaction films employ them theyre cheap but animated films can show anything so why wallow in an industrial trash heap,negative
the action scenes and shootemups dont satisfy either,negative
the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast cant bring them to life in fact their efforts merely emphasize what were missing,negative
aki is especially disappointing with her lack of expression and flat delivery she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena the eloi girl from 1960s the time machine,negative
drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jello molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces,negative
students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind final fantasy the spirits within but i found it subpar across the board,negative
futurama does more effective battle visuals the kids in south park are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of the outer limits does better doom and gloom scifi,negative
so who needs this,negative
not me,negative
i am a steven seagal fan,negative
i only say this now because mufti splenetik isnt my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things,negative
any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on,negative
seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones which well always hear when seagal does his limbtwisting thing rarely a female colead in sight unless its a reallife modelwife who hasnt worked since weird science and usually the worst possible titles you can imagine,negative
not to mention very straightforward plots generally allround bad dialogue and mr implacable leatherface himself in that same black outfit hes been in since nico doing his my hands are sharp nimble knives thing seagal the stoic sir petrified ponytail duke of dull,negative
in the glimmer man seagal breaks out of this formula he gets a sidekick attempts to banter and puts on a new vest,negative
hes also put on quite a lot of weight,negative
small potatoes you may say a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to but damnit if it aint broke why fix it,negative
more on this disappointed persons dashed expectations later,negative
as jack cole seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past,negative
while he and his partner played by keenen ivory wayans are investigating a series of ritual killings cole himself becomes a suspect especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole,negative
it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin you just cant trust these homicide detectives someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them and hence well you know that glimmer man thing,negative
an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman bob gunton coles former cia boss brian cox and deals involving chemical weapons,negative
the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff drawing as with his other films elements from the hotter films of the year eg se7en,negative
its the other changes that disappoint,negative
for example although theres a fair amount of violence in this movie theres also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans probably the best known of the wayans tribe how many are there exactly from televisions in living colour,negative
wayans plays whiney straightman to seagals beadadorned and brocadedraped cole keeping up his are you crazy part of the dialogue with wasted zest,negative
as campbell wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partners eccentric habits but the chemistry between the two is minimal and seagals wooden comebacks make for painful watching,negative
a cook in under seige 2 seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble,negative
he chants refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies,negative
again a benign if trite plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual,negative
heck he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film,negative
is that a lot to ask of the seague,negative
too much,negative
seagals best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages and to do it silently and alone,negative
not for seagal the snappy oneliners of arnold and stallone nor the attempts to show that he can act much less think,negative
no kindergarten cop no oscar just simple unadulterated deathblows,negative
thats really how it must have started likeminded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else,negative
we trusted him,negative
we got to know him,negative
now betrayal,negative
i dont know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that hes going to try to be funny again,negative
ill try but it wont be easy,negative
if you havent watched the glimmer man yet you might want to wait for the video to come out,negative
its easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences,negative
after all if we cant depend on our fantasies what can we depend on,negative
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,negative
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,negative
pretty good bring a friend,negative
amazing potent stuff,negative
perfection,negative
see it twice,negative
mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan,negative
everybody makes mistakes once in awhile,negative
carry on at your convenience is all about the goingson in the factory of a toilet manufacturer wc boggs kenneth williams,negative
once they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote charles hawtrey has designed a suitable model the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner kenneth cope and friend bernie hulke bernard bresslaw who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext,negative
meanwhile chief foreman sid plummer sid james is growing tired of his wife beattie hattie jacques and her budgie,negative
he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore joan sims but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races he is over the moon and flush with money,negative
his daughter myrtle plummer jacki piper is going out with wcs son lewis boggs richard ocallaghan and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions,negative
in the end if the strike does not cease boggs will have to close down his factory but the support of a group of women led by cootes wifetobe and spanners mother agatha spanner renee houston try to resolve the situation,negative
also sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners,negative
there are some good performances as usual from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles,negative
charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes,negative
his part is mildly amusing,negative
richard ocallaghan is appealing as boggs stuckup son patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering boggs assistant and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha,negative
however sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer,negative
although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character,negative
a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress,negative
the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope,negative
in his carry on debut cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny,negative
joan sims returns as the love interest instead of barbara windsor,negative
sims usual part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques,negative
additionally bill maynard as fred moore is very poor,negative
this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer the locations and wealth of characters are appealing,negative
however the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired,negative
this movie does not know where it is going,negative
it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for bluer jokes or to maintain the innocent jokes success of most of its predecessors,negative
that is why this film suffers,negative
a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques,negative
the new minorregulars such as ocallaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while,negative
i dont appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting when in fact its ludicrous,negative
in the case of the generals daughter the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point,negative
but at this juncture in the story the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie,negative
this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of its detailed flaws,negative
get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent and youre likely to survive this entire movie,negative
travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner whos working undercover at a military base when another situation arises the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer leslie stefanson,negative
it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell,negative
let the investigation begin,negative
with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill played rather onthesidelines by madeleine stowe brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case,negative
things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore james woods a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve,negative
woods submits another scenestealing performance here as he oozes authority surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar,negative
with echoes of his supporting role in true crime in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges he makes every moment believable,negative
here though the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta as the two send mindful knowing glares across the room,negative
there are many scenes such as this in the generals daughter in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb,negative
director simon west con air shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it,negative
the generals daughter is more often than not a predictable and unexciting mess,negative
it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless dragging its heels all the way at a mindnumbing snails pace,negative
a few brief action scenes marvelously handled in the editing department show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package,negative
from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts i suggest west should stick with mindless riproaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this,negative
still the movie is certainly not without its merits,negative
the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast,negative
the performances range from commanding travolta to electric woods to stiffasaboard cromwell who doesnt show off his real talents here,negative
madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while but as the female lead in an actionthriller she doesnt pull through sufficiently,negative
one of the problems with the execution is that its very predictable,negative
from minute one i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question,negative
the script even unwillingly points him out for us using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end,negative
in all fairness weve seen many of the devices used in the generals daughter put to greater effect in other films,negative
the secrets behind the girls mysterious death are explained gradually but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly,negative
the generals daughter is not a terrible movie and it is involving enough to sustain a viewers attention span for a certain period of time,negative
but it just could have been so much better,negative
various films seen at the seattle film festival,negative
its all men on a raft u s a 19421986 director orson welles,negative
a recently uncovered onefourth of orson welles planned docudrama of amazing stories around the world named its all true this short dealt with welles attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft,negative
while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welles attempts to film it despite studio problems a staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set,negative
impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians,negative
sadie thompson u s a 1928 director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on w somerset maughams story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent,negative
after the discussion of the newlyrestored version of frank capras lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills i was interested to see sadie thompson where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago,negative
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson,negative
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seenlittle awkwardness and a very clever script,negative
the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadies soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel,negative
swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie,negative
unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of liveaction film or the original script,negative
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on i cannot believe maughams short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion weve been waiting an hour and a half for,negative
still its entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymores incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds,negative
a c movie worth 2 50 if you can find it,negative
the pied piper czechoslovakia 1986 director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza,negative
this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids,negative
it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate and with a lot of political comment along with it,negative
perhaps economic content is a better wordit certainly doesnt show capitalism in a good light,negative
nor human nature nor anything else for that matter,negative
as you may have guessed this is not a tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over,negative
not that it wasnt interesting for technical reasons this is stopanimation that is very well done,negative
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnutsexcept for the animated stuffed rats,negative
boy sounds like a real comedy vehicle doesnt it,negative
add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night,negative
some gore,negative
dont bring children to this one,negative
dont bring adults to this one unless theyre fascinated by puppetry hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped,negative
blech,negative
no fun whatsoever,negative
meier west germany 1986 peter timm cast rainier grenkowitz nadja engelbrecht alexander hauff thomas besvater subtitled,negative
this film takes us back and forth over the east german border with meier an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money,negative
his uncle also in the west sneaks meier out of the country unknown to the east germans,negative
meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in east germany,negative
after a roundtheworld trip his boss thinks hes on leave in bulgaria meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crews workwhile everyone thinks hes still living in east germany,negative
of course something goes wrongand the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there,negative
the humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting,negative
still a good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny,negative
c 2 50,negative
the right hand man australia 1986 director di drew screenplay helen hodgman cast rupert everett hugo weaving arthur dignam jennifer claire catherine mcclements,negative
after a lifetime of moviegoing and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival ive learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to,negative
1 be wary of french comedies,negative
these people like jerry lewis,negative
2 ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait,negative
3 any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old poutylips is probably not worth watching,negative
4 when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out,negative
australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult not impossiblewitness malcolm last year task,negative
well i ignored rules 3 4 last night and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards,negative
its as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30s about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses,negative
lots and lots of horses,negative
the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir,negative
unfortunately said son a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident,negative
highlights include the amputation sequence the doctors daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for a diagnosis their tender kissing with a window between them while its rainingyoud think a woman studying medicine would know better,negative
the photography is good but i kept wishing for bweverything seems sepiacolored anyway,negative
actually i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead but thats life,negative
grade z avoid like the plague unless youre looking for inadvertent yuks,negative
topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devils advocate movies that have a brilliant beginning but dont know how to end,negative
it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other,negative
there is liz who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment prue who is getting married geoff lizs boyfriend neil her previous boyfriend ant who has written a screenplay,negative
for the first hour we get to know these people through everyday activities as they talk on the phone go out to dinner hang clothes on the line,negative
the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the filmmakers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them,negative
at times the events border on the ridiculous like the screening of the film but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives,negative
this doesnt sound like a brilliant premise for a film we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related but its the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing,negative
unfortunately this level of honesty isnt maintained,negative
with about half an hour to go a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama,negative
such a disappointment after such a brilliant start,negative
the actors are all quite good with ms danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive,negative
the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable,negative
a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film,negative
it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles,negative
that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock,negative
up till that point i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place,negative
while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility its unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film,negative
not just the events but also the tone of some of the end is wrong clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it,negative
this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film,negative
as stated above the first hour is superb and even the end is above average,negative
it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss,negative
an american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england,negative
the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects,negative
more specifically the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf and for the ghosts that haunt the main character,negative
even twenty years after its release that part of the movie is still impressive,negative
although i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive,negative
the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure,negative
if it werent for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980,negative
and with good reason the acting isnt great and neither is the writing,negative
well ok we dont actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film,negative
but one other important element is lacking here too it isnt scary,negative
with no exception you know what is going to happen before it happens,negative
you dont even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint,negative
i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen,negative
but john it just wasnt scary,negative
i didnt know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it but it didnt work for me,negative
actually it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films,negative
but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad the intended humor was lost on me,negative
its never a good sign that you dont realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material,negative
call me crazy but you shouldnt have to do research on a movie to enjoy it,negative
im not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up,negative
werewolf bites boy david naughton,negative
boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse jenny agutter and then strange things begin to happen to boy,negative
including and i must admit this is a very nice touch visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital,negative
the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse,negative
i know it sounds strange but it actually works,negative
the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy griffin dunne are really the best parts of the movie,negative
as i said probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects,negative
while they are still impressive today they arent impressive enough or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film,negative
and since they are more or less the highlight of the film there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch,negative
actually the 1998 sequel an american werewolf in paris is more entertaining since it doesnt take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way,negative
the kids in the hall are an acquired taste,negative
it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer,negative
maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies they would grow into the big screen,negative
my recommendation is that unless you are a big fan of the kids skip the film,negative
as it is their firstand most likely onlyattempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv,negative
a bigbudget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show,negative
the kids go through the motions but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so,negative
and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics,negative
brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression,negative
in typical sketchcomedy tradition each actor plays several roles,negative
doctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug,negative
then under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals dr cooper releases the drug into the marketplace,negative
the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film,negative
at about 90 minutes brain candy still seems long,negative
the best thing about sketch comedyand the kids are no exceptionis the ability to quickly deliver the laughs then go on to another quick skit,negative
but with the additional setup necessary in telling a longer coherent story the laughs just dont come fast enough,negative
strangely the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv,negative
the movie makes several attempts at risquenessmostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons charactersbut they seem almost forced as if they have to live up to a pg rating,negative
one of the best bits though does make use of thompsons naked buttocks we see him charging into battlegoing to have sex with some guys taking a shower,negative
in the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail,negative
the kids unfortunately are not up to the task,negative
there are some amusing moments to be sure but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one,negative
michael robbins hardball is quite the cinematic achievement,negative
in about two hours we get a glancing examination of ghetto life a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy speeches about never giving up a cache of cute kids including a fat one with asthma a hardluck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic big game where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined,negative
all thats needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich s,negative
i cant wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd,negative
obviously hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball,negative
it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam,negative
out of solutions he begs his successful corporate friend the always welcome mike mcglone to lend him 5 000,negative
instead mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend,negative
reeves who wants to keep his fingers accepts the offer but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely,negative
the drowsyvoiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs,negative
and maybe just maybe theyll play in the big championship game,negative
one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins summer catch adapted from daniel coyles nonfiction book is that there arent any,negative
the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie,negative
that wouldnt be so bad if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them,negative
most of the kids time is spent yelling at each other talking in slang and acting surprised,negative
theres little thats naturally amusing about them as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling,negative
the worst of the lot is a toughtalking younger player dewayne warren whose sole purpose as the movie unfolds is being an emotional pawn a tactic so utterly despicable i cant find the right words to express myself,negative
the adults also dont fare well,negative
reeves is impressively uninspiring as the downonhisluck loser,negative
the character is poorly written but reeves gives another charismafree performance,negative
every time he speaks he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up,negative
kids are supposed to rally around this guy,negative
diane lane who costars as reeves obligatory love interest remains a glowing screen presence see my dog skip for better proof,negative
its too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like these kids trust you and they dont trust anyone,negative
then theres d b,negative
sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters youve seen before and hope never to see again,negative
i wanted hardball to be good,negative
robbins varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved,negative
i havent seen robbins goofy ready to rumble in its entirety but i am intrigued that macho man randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions,negative
robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte making sports movies for guys and not cutesy cuddly pap such as hardball which also manages to annoy and insult the audience,negative
heres hoping that happens in the immediate future,negative
after 1993s falling down i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director,negative
since then he has offered us two soso adaptations of john grisham novels the client and a time to kill and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise,negative
although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumachers potential the publicity for his latest release 8mm raised new hope,negative
it promised to be something unusual,negative
it wasnt,negative
the plot goes like this tom welles nicolas cage is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman allegorically named mrs christian myra carter to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husbands belongings,negative
the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask who reminds me of bane in schumachers batman robin,negative
because murders can be realistically simulated in movies mrs christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead,negative
by combing through missing persons reports tom finds the girls name and tracks her to los angeles,negative
with the aid of max california joaquin phoenix a video store clerk and another symbolic name tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff,negative
the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schraders hardcore in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter,negative
both films are modeled on dantes the inferno of course 8mm makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil,negative
hardcore is a much more subtle and meaningful film,negative
8mm had a lot of promise,negative
in its better moments its an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom,negative
one moment of the first sort when we first meet max hes reading truman capotes in cold blood underneath the cover of a porn novel,negative
in cold blood was the father of the truecrime genre which is the literary equivalent of snuff films,negative
max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom dance with the devil and the devil dont change the devil changes you,negative
tom does changeill let you discover the specifics for yourselfbut not permanently,negative
schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didnt have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldnt come back,negative
walkers seven did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise,negative
cage tries hard to pull it off but the script doesnt give him enough to work with,negative
phoenix walks away with the moviehes smart charming and funny,negative
other cast members include fargo s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and the sopranos s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far,negative
in the last analysis since 8mm falls short of its pretensions and its promise its just another private eye story in the raymond macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege,negative
however unlike other predictable fare in the genrelast years twilight for example 8mm is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is,negative
my giant is two movies for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free,negative
as lamely directed by michael lehmann the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book,negative
without goliath david is just some punk throwing rocks,negative
languidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer the omen meanders toward its sad ending,negative
since its rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery,negative
other than a few nice visuals theres nothing to recommend the picture,negative
with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally to the original city slickers billy crystal has shown that hes more than the worlds best oscar host,negative
he does however have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last years fathers day and this years my giant,negative
one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project,negative
surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there,negative
perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success,negative
or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movies somber tone,negative
the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day,negative
this onejoke movies single idea is to place reallife basketball player gheorghe muresan who stands seven and a half feet tall into as many visually striking situations as possible,negative
sammy crystal an agent currently without clients is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max muresan,negative
after throwing out constant oneliners either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car,negative
sammy decides to get serious seeing max as his meal ticket,negative
and although he doesnt like it hes willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a halfdozen dwarfs,negative
the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever,negative
after a series of missed opportunities the comedic part of the movie is over and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie,negative
we learn that maxs condition is terminal and he will soon die,negative
to be fair the movie does contain a few good scenes all of which you can see in the trailers,negative
lets hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie,negative
my giant runs too long even at just 1 37,negative
it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up,negative
my son jeffrey and his friend matthew both 9 gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it,negative
matthew pointed out that it is not as good as it could have been or should have been,negative
amen,negative
he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle,negative
jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was,negative
