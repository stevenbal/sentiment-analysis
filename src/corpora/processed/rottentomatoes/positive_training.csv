with more and more television shows having gay characters and even the infamous ellen sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines,positive
the birdcage was critically acclaimed as was this years chasing amy,positive
then along came in out and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released,positive
its also noticeable that this alternative lifestyle becomes less and less taboo as the years go by and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort,positive
while its a very serious issue to many it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety,positive
but the way were using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically,positive
while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh at it is more and more becoming something we laugh with and when a movie like in out comes along it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy,positive
it doesnt poke fun at the lifestyle it simply uses it to all its comedic capacity just as love sex marriage birth death and anything else has been,positive
the idea for in out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aidsafflicted gay man in philadelphia,positive
if you remember during his acceptance speech hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life,positive
its a serious and touchy subject but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick,positive
its true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual it may have been more controversial but because it was written by an openly gay writer the prerogative was set,positive
kevin kline who only seems to become more and more acclaimed stars as howard brackett a high school english teacher in the small picturesque town of greenleaf indiana,positive
after a threeyear engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery joan cusack a wedding date has been set and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story greenleaf high graduate cameron drake matt dillon is up for a best actor oscar,positive
the small town eagerly awaits both events and both seem quite astronomical but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other,positive
when cameron drake is announced the winner the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher mr brackett,positive
everyone is cheering back in greenleaf that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words and hes gay,positive
the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop,positive
the thing is nobody including howard can understand how cameron came to that conclusion and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf,positive
naturally the questions pour from howards fiancee parents debbie reynolds wilford brimley students and the high schools principal tom halliwell bob newhart and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious howard is clean neat honest sincere a romantic and perhaps the most incriminating fact he loves barbara streisand,positive
the frenzy isnt helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and entertainment tonight wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning,positive
one particular reporter is peter malloy tom selleck of inside entertainment who unlike the collage of other reporters wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett including coverage of his wedding,positive
the intrusion is all but welcome by howard who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute,positive
it seems that no matter where he turns a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees,positive
the dominoes begin to tumble as howards closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay,positive
it all sounds very devastating and it would be if it werent presented with nearperfection by one of this years most delightful ensemble casts,positive
kline seems only to improve with age and he is downright perfect here,positive
the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine and they use it wonderfully,positive
every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever,positive
dillon has never been so likeable cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role and brimley reynolds and newhart all provide huge laughs when theyre up to bat,positive
rudnicks script is heavily laced with wit and humor and youll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes,positive
while in out doesnt carry enough to give it four stars it remains one of the best done films of the year allaround,positive
the script is exuberant the actors are absolutely top notch and were allowed just the perfect blend of hearttugging so as not to bog down the laughs,positive
it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety yet were still allowed a sappily touching ending,positive
despite its subject matter and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex this is a movie that everyone could and should enjoy,positive
frank oz best known as a voice talent for muppets directs this film quite delightfully using all the potential rudnicks script has to offer which turns out to be quite a bit,positive
check this one out,positive
youll have a gay old time,positive
the happy bastards 30second review,positive
notting hill,positive
a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott a very popular actress with a 15 million asking price for movies,positive
one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident played by hugh grant and sparks somehow begin to fly,positive
sure there are points of turmoil such as putting up with grants slightly disgusting but very hilarious roommate spike annas pesky exboyfriend alec baldwin in a humorous cameo and on top of all that those damn press,positive
its a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy very different from say a stubborn father or not the right time like as seen in usual flicks,positive
roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl,positive
in short a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs particularly provided by spike,positive
one teeshirt really says it all about him,positive
in an attempt to turn on a woman he shows the front of the shirt which says you are the most beautiful woman in the world,positive
on the back,positive
fancy a f k,positive
i like movies with albert brooks and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks,positive
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies,positive
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator,positive
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters,positive
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we cant brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh,positive
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably wont find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will,positive
put simply brooks comedy is intelligent,positive
mother is albert brooks latest film and it does not disappoint,positive
brooks plays john henderson a middleaged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce,positive
he makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably,positive
he then has dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life,positive
jeff has a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds,positive
after dinner john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunkydory the dialog is,positive
in comparison beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him and john gives it right back to her,positive
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart johns life she says i love you and john replies with i know you think you do,positive
the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nitpicking and guilt loading,positive
its the kind that goes something like yes dear i think you do that wonderfully but,positive
it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy,positive
theres always the big but,positive
john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed selfesteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner,positive
he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is,positive
a great experiment he calls it,positive
brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction john has with his mother,positive
theres a scene where john has just arrived at his mothers house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you dont want to stay at a hotel,positive
she still doesnt get it and it is absolutely hilarious,positive
in the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh,positive
she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over,positive
when john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze,positive
youve named the ice,positive
asks john,positive
hes also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as a twentypound block of cheese,positive
the freezer was a good invention says john but its not supposed to be used for everything,positive
thats why its smaller than the refrigerator,positive
its something most of us find strangely familiar,positive
brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur,positive
for example in defending your life his and meryl streeps characters are in a comedy club having a discussion,positive
when theyre finished and walk out brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside,positive
you dont know what the joke was because you couldnt hear him during the entire scene but i must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context,positive
in this film brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene,positive
i dont want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past,positive
johns purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him,positive
his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as john spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth,positive
watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way,positive
on screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world,positive
in a way hes very much like yosarian of catch22 expect with something of an attitude,positive
casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect,positive
she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable its hard to get mad at her character,positive
this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her,positive
as his first choice brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimers disease,positive
that may be just as well since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely,positive
rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mothers favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as a mamas boy,positive
the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes,positive
a solid connection is not really made between johns troubles and his reasons for living with his mother,positive
additionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this,positive
beatrice you must think im some kind of moron,positive
john no i think your someone who thinks im a moron,positive
beatrice well it takes one to know one,positive
its tough to really say something nice about a type of person whos so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god american history x does it and for that i commend it,positive
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neonazi skinhead a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone whos not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off,positive
the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack,positive
hes the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks,positive
hes so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process,positive
his name is derek vinyard and hes played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks hes almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as say malcom x when we first see him hes clean shaven with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast a devlish goatee and hes attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets at least when he doesnt need them,positive
he so believes in his convictions that hes willing to put his beliefs to the test even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison if only for a couple years,positive
american history x is about derek how he became a neonazi skinhead how he rose to power how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself and how he tried to save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake,positive
we see him at all of these stages as a smart teenager a vicious hate monger a man having an epiphany and the man who tries to correct what hes done before and in all of these we get a portrait of a man from all sides,positive
or at least thats the intention,positive
the films framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about 13 also now a skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brooks who i just found out was or is the captain on star treks deep space 9 is trying to correct him,positive
when the film opens danny has just written a book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble with sweeney which causes him to make him write a paper on dereks life and how it has gotten him nowhere,positive
coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him hes cleanedup not as buff and has a full head of hair,positive
hes just as intelligent but still very rough along the edges but hes wisened up,positive
hes no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews and tries to persuade danny whos becoming what derek was before to give up his lifestyle,positive
but danny wont,positive
he goes to a large skinhead beer bash meets with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neonazidom as he was for it a couple of years ago,positive
the film circles around this then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks all done in black and white,positive
we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasisadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white middleclass teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on,positive
to them the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he backs everything up with political reasons justifying their rage at least to them,positive
and frighteningly enough much of what he says sounds true,positive
american history x is a collection of really great scenes and moments rather than a cohesive great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next,positive
in it there are some of the best scenes ive seen all year,positive
one scene features a dinner between dereks family and his mothers newest boyfriend played with reserve by eliott gould a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with dereks rightist views launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience goulds reaction to dereks final summation is unnerrving,positive
another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black coworker guy torry while folding laundry in prison,positive
and another soontobeclassic is actually divided in two the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year,positive
theres much more to appreciate like the acting which is uniformly good with standouts coming from avery brooks beverly dangelo as the longsuffering mother and gould who has one horrible line but other than that comes off with the best performance hes given in what seems like a really long time,positive
norton walks off with the film though coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble,positive
in only the fifth movie of his career norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation and maybe the best,positive
theres nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando,positive
that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing,positive
sadly enough this isnt going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be,positive
its too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece,positive
the ending especially is pencilled in from other movies tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon,positive
some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more and even the dramatic arc isnt as well travelled,positive
furlongs danny never seems to really be learning a lesson since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view and when he decides to make a change by the end which was inevitable it doesnt seem like it has actually arrived there,positive
even dereks descent into skinheaddom doesnt seem justified,positive
though his fireman father william russ the dad from boy meets world and dont ask me how i know that is killed by a black junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs,positive
as such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted to have his name removed,positive
sorta,positive
american history x is a very good movie and i was very moved by it but it could be a lot better and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential,positive
somewhere he claims there lies a tony kaye cut and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus,positive
although he aimed for the directing credit to go to alan smithee the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director it wasnt allowed to him under the grounds that once you disown a film you can not badmouth it but really thats the macguffin no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval,positive
kayes right in that its not up to par even if hes not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par,positive
this will not be a do the right thing for the late 90s,positive
yet it still gets its point across intelligently and backs it up with its story its message that one cannot be so enwrapped in ones own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately,positive
and even if it isnt perfect at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything hes done has made his life any better it realy hits a nerve not only in derek but also in the audience,positive
i have a soft spot in my heart for pure amoral sleaze,positive
i liked showgirls there i said it,positive
i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz sexfilled cinematic tabloidish trash,positive
wild things is the best sleazy film ive ever seen,positive
its filled with great performances graphic sex threeway sex rape charges doublecrosses plot twists genitalia of all genders graphic violence death witty humor and best of all denise richards,positive
criticizing this film for being disgusting raucous and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing or titanic for being lofty and epic,positive
wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors but i dont just admire it for thisi admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies,positive
i must admit upfront however that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal,positive
i imagine that this shows,positive
its hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldnt be known,positive
i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer but i was wrong there are a lot of turns here,positive
ill just say that the film takes place in blue bay a rich little town in florida,positive
in blue bay lives sam lombardo matt dillon a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students kelly van ryan denise richards and suzie toller neve campbell,positive
kellys mother sandra theresa russell immediately presses charges,positive
all of this happens fairly early in the film,positive
and right up until this point i had the whole film predicted,positive
i was wrong though and every time i was proven wrong i was shocked,positive
wild things isnt even remotely plausible but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless and often invited just for kicks,positive
i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers,positive
id give the preview four stars,positive
it made me want to see the movie so much that ive been waiting for it anxiously ever since,positive
over the past few weeks though i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview see independence day thankfully i was proven wrong,positive
the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company not only does it make us want to see the film but it doesnt give away any of the secrets,positive
but im not here to talk about the preview,positive
im here to talk about denise richards,positive
now i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene shes in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can,positive
of course this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes and,positive
flawless body but,positive
i thought she did a great job acting too stop laughing,positive
no richards is truly a findshe is talented and always convincing in this film,positive
this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future,positive
the other actors are good too,positive
dillon is as suave as ever its nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in out,positive
bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer,positive
neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them though i wont pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex,positive
for a plot like this to work all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived,positive
thats okay because director john mcnaughton knows that hes making a selfconsciously wicked film,positive
each sceneeven the threeway sex sceneis observed with hilarity by mcnaughton and the result is a sleazefest thats too smart to resist,positive
there isnt an inconsistent moment in wild things every bit of it is alluring garbage so trashy its funny and so entertaining its painful,positive
i loved it,positive
when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space,positive
it really is too bad that comedies are so hit andmiss because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver,positive
but weep not dear readers because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet,positive
austin powers the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things ive had the pleasure to see in a long time a completely looney delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks,positive
if all comedies or even half or what am i saying,positive
even a fifth of them could be this consistently hysterical i would take up residence at my local multiplex,positive
even more to this movies credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 hit austin powers international man of mystery,positive
the original came out of nowhere it was a lowbudget eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody,positive
all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america,positive
ironically powers yeeeeah baby yeah,positive
has almost become an icon of the late 90s,positive
thus another installment was inevitable but its also undoubtedly welcome,positive
the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained over thetop comedies i have ever seen in my entire life,positive
it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor even if only briefly and adds new ones,positive
austin powers mike myers a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo oh youll figure it out which dr evil meyers again has stolen,positive
he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr evil yet again,positive
surprisingly the real star is dr evil rather than austin,positive
he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie,positive
perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately,positive
instead of being the scheming villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling often sweet mad scientist wannabe,positive
the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original but thats okay by me because the original left us wanting more,positive
by the time that one was over we havent had nearly our share of shag jokes crude puns and powers antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites,positive
even by its conclusions im still not sure ive had my fill of bits like do you smoke after sex,positive
i dont know baby i never looked,positive
this may seem awfully immature of me but understand that the austin powers series unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days is genuinely funny,positive
i dont know if ive ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious just the two of us rendition by dr evil and his new miniature clone named minime,positive
i dont have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort,positive
indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did,positive
but as far as im concerned that is enough,positive
1999 eugene novikov 137,positive
what if one of our cities became the target for terror,positive
what can we do,positive
what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism,positive
what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster,positive
so far america has been the leading nation opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world,positive
it is the land of opportunities,positive
it is the land of freedom,positive
but what if it became the new target,positive
this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality,positive
when a special branch of the united states military under the command of general william devereaux bruce willis takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice,positive
the only warning the fbi receives is a single cryptic message release him,positive
then all hell breaks loose in new york,positive
a bus is destroyed killing 25 civilians,positive
a broadway theater is bombed,positive
hostages are taken at a school,positive
as the wave of terrorist activity crests the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law,positive
devereaux argues against that eventuality but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 000 men into action on american soil,positive
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard denzel washington the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities,positive
his staff is comprised of smart energetic intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o,positive
f moronic feds were used to seeing in movies,positive
hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft annette bening whose department knows more about the situation than theyre willing to reveal,positive
but the attacks escalate,positive
the fbi are helpless chasing an invisible enemy,positive
the land is under siege,positive
they have lost control a,positive
terror is coming from within,positive
whats great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life,positive
it reflects reality,positive
and thats why it makes such an impact,positive
edward zwick has created a clever well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season,positive
the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously,positive
and so his film plays on several levels never loosing focus on its main objective,positive
he is exploring the abuse of power the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u s government the army the fbi and the cia,positive
he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved,positive
the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii,positive
there are concentration camps and unlawful interments all in the name of the greater good,positive
in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul freedom,positive
was that what the terror,positive
ists really wanted,positive
this film has evoked protests and objections from the arabamerican population in the u s and n y especially,positive
but to me these protests seem unnecessary,positive
zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys,positive
the script is therefore wonderfully balanced,positive
agent hubbards best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad tony shalhoub is lebaneseamerican,positive
and it is quite often you hear lines such as my first boyfriend was palestinian,positive
they seduce you with their suffering or they love this country as much as we do,positive
but no matter how you twist this matter you wont get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arabspeaking population who are in the great majority,positive
more to the point the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arabamericans by the u s military,positive
and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any,positive
way,positive
denzel washington is dashing as always,positive
in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual,positive
anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage a network of snitches and seduction to gather information,positive
bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist hungry for power that never looses his connection with the audience since his point of view is not too hard to understand,positive
the film is elegantly shaped,positive
the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong,positive
zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism,positive
he tightens the intensity as the events progress,positive
and when a plot twist comes it actually is surprising,positive
it is not a film drained in patriotism like the work of roland emerich,positive
nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values,positive
it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey,positive
it has courage enough to get involved in politics,positive
it questions our foreign policies mentality and defense,positive
i must admit that it ends rather disappointing as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down,positive
but despite of that it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts a virtue that few summer films can boast of,positive
this is the u s army,positive
its a broadsword not a scalpel,positive
believe me you do not want us in an american city gen william devereaux the siege,positive
usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug but not the big lebowski,positive
the new offering from the creators of 1996s critical hit fargo is to say the least wildly entertaining,positive
originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brothers movies and the big lebowski is insanely original,positive
it begins oddly enough when jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is mistaken for a millionaire jeff the big lebowski david huddleston whos wife bunny tara reid owes money all over town,positive
two goons out to collect on bunnys debt break into dudes house,positive
they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug,positive
the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team steve buscemi john goodman respectively,positive
he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug,positive
he does this and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper,positive
this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments,positive
the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly,positive
also several great supporting roles john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus,positive
the coens script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining,positive
i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998,positive
if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one if not they give this one a try its a little different,positive
steve soderberghs sex lies and videotape which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 arguably began the resurgence of independent films,positive
made on a shoestring budget of 1 2 million with then relatively unknown actors it is a provocative thoroughly original drama,positive
the film mostly focuses on the four central characters all in their late 20searly 30s,positive
ann andie macdowell an unfulfilled housewife is married to john peter gallagher an insensitive lawyer who unbeknownst to her is having an affair with her younger sister cynthia laura san giacomo,positive
complicating matters even worse is graham james spader who won best actor at cannes johns old college buddy who comes to stay at their house,positive
ann is absolutely won over by him even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex,positive
that is the setup for the last hour of the picture and since the film is entitled sex lies and videotape it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise,positive
director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker ranging from the independent to the mainstream 1998s out of sight to the downright kafkaesque 1997s schizopolis,positive
he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances and believes in the work that he does and sex lies and videotape is probably his most confident and maybe even best to date,positive
the performances are superb from all four leads but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character,positive
she is always a very winning actress but this is probably her most threedimensional role that she has had with a close second being altmans 1993 mosaic short cuts,positive
the other parts are perfectly cast as well from spaders ominous graham to gallaghers selfinvolved john to giacomos outspoken cynthia,positive
the final act of the film especially comes right out of left field and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching and it would be criminal to give away the films secrets,positive
suffice to say that through one powerful sequence ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty as well as deception,positive
the film has one fault however,positive
the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another and often unlikable,positive
if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher it probably would have helped since his relationship with macdowell isnt quite as explored as i would have liked,positive
sex lies and videotape although minorly flawed is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film,positive
soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it and the final product certainly proves this,positive
are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny,positive
brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film next stop wonderland,positive
the two main characters alan and erin spend the entire movie in each others orbit catching glimpses of one another yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion,positive
is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together,positive
does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life,positive
as the film starts erin castleton hope davis a melancholy 29 year old late shift nurse is ending her livein relationship with her boyfriend hoffman,positive
rather he is ending it with her,positive
arriving home from work erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment car packed with his belongings,positive
in a fumbling amusing and self deluding ramble he instructs erin to watch a videotape hes made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why hes leaving,positive
its obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship,positive
he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief,positive
erins mother holland taylor in a surprisingly effective small role fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life takes out a personal ad for erin,positive
to erins embarrassed horror the ad describes her as a frisky cultured carefree professional with a zest for life,positive
eventually erin responds to the tidal wave of responses which makes for some of the most humorous telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and poseurs,positive
alan a plumber and aspiring marine biologist first spots erin as hes cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium,positive
wearing a wet suit and goggles he follows erin from window to window separated by the glass as erin oblivious to his gaze enjoys the fish,positive
later we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside mere feet away,positive
the movie spends its entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing,positive
there are several subplots involving alan,positive
one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business,positive
another subplot involves his fathers desperate attempts to force fates hand by gambling away his life at the dog track,positive
a distracting focus is put on alans debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off,positive
the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy,positive
thankfully his dream guy persona is counterbalanced by erins distant yet fundamentally hopeful personality,positive
the film moves along at an unhurried pace albeit too much so in the latter third as we wait for the two to meet,positive
cowriters anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships,positive
the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over,positive
when alan and erin eventually do meet we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering almost subliminally knowing gaze,positive
its a sweet measured moment,positive
the disappointment comes in the fact that weve come to know the pair yet we dont get to view their impending romance,positive
the films inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to ones life makes next stop wonderland a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions shallow characters and overdone special effects,positive
i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate cubas oscar nominee for best foreign film directed by tomas gutierrez alea who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo memories of underdevelopment,positive
i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late 70s it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition,positive
i knew then that memorias was probably a statesanctioned political missive and now expect strawberry will follow suit,positive
fellow internetters primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba soc culture cuba have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs,positive
i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party lineit probably looks like political criticism but it aint so,positive
having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castros repressiveness i cant conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution and i cant imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement,positive
as kids say these days duh the revolutions current state needs no criticism its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident,positive
the proper questions to put relate to castros legitimacy,positive
i bet the film takes castros power for granted and that this or any other movie produced under cubas state control cannot question his right to run cubas political show ongoing now for more than 36 years,positive
thats why i just cant believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime,positive
lets see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up,positive
i saw the filmtwice,positive
i was right castro remained intact,positive
strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young dialectic materialist as he describes himself and a homosexual photographer diego in 1979 cuba,positive
the young man david is the son of peasants a symbol of the revolutions reason for being,positive
grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education he studies political science instead of literature his avocation because he perceives it is his duty,positive
therein lies a likely unintended irony since cuba has no need for political theoreticians,positive
cubas government is castro,positive
diegos lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life,positive
he enjoys the finer thingstea opera art,positive
he does not do voluntary work for the revolution,positive
his small apartment is a sensual oasis,positive
the moniker bourgeois figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie,positive
however he is a revolucionario in his own way,positive
the supporting roles are filled by an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche davids roommate who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme davids exgirlfriend who dumped him for another guy yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband german a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit and who strikes a faustian pact with the government,positive
gutierrez alea and codirector juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too,positive
heck towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor,positive
he really loves the revolution as supposedly does everybody else in cuba and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws,positive
real criticism is missing though,positive
this movie is political window dressing,positive
luis aguilar leons op,positive
ed,positive
piece on fresa in the miami herald 10 march 1995 at 21a did not color my judgment it presaged my intuition,positive
aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this films political angle best like many artistic manifestations in cuba strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment,positive
as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point,positive
although terrible propaganda this is otherwise a fine film,positive
labelling is sometimes everything,positive
in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own,positive
walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors,positive
producers werent thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones,positive
on the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america,positive
to make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written by xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago,positive
instead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city,positive
the gathering organised by gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx,positive
that is far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce,positive
on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city,positive
crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus,positive
police simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing and their leader gets killed by riffs,positive
the remaining eight led by cleons lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs,positive
upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status,positive
however despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year,positive
the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly,positive
if walter hills idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably,positive
the future was much worse than his vision,positive
the youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able to take over entire cities,positive
their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime,positive
in their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns,positive
they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own,positive
many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors,positive
some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour,positive
despite those objections the warriors have all the elements of a very good film,positive
the plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes,positive
the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isnt much bloodshed or gore in the movie,positive
editing is superb events happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his wouldbegirlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory,positive
the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable,positive
yet the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity,positive
best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains,positive
michael beck as cool almost statesmanlike leader of a gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hotshot contender for top spot,positive
all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies,positive
there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason,positive
good will hunting is about one of those people,positive
the will hunting of the horrible title lets face it this film would be a bitch to title played by cowriter matt damon is a mathematical genius,positive
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino,positive
and he works at mit as the janitor,positive
one day the professor of one of the most challenging courses proffessor lambeau breaking the waves s stellan skarsg rd puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete,positive
the next day its already done on the board but no one in his class claims to have done it,positive
so lambeau puts another problem on the board this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove,positive
and duh its done again,positive
of course they catch the guy who did it red handed will,positive
before lambeau can find will again he ran away when he caught him will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court and struck a police officer so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements a he work with him on math and b he get some therapy,positive
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another for a hypnotist he fakes being under his spell then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic afternoon delight,positive
finally lambeaus old college roomate sean mcguire robin williams a psych professor agrees to treat him and the two begin a rocky relationship as sean tries to get will to open up,positive
turns out will had a rough childhood being abandoned and placed in foster homes and what not,positive
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life he wants a challenge,positive
and that is to hang out with his buds including the other cowriter ben affleck and do honorable jobs like construction,positive
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky,positive
should this guy be forced to do something he doesnt want to do,positive
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film which is jampacked with greatness but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should,positive
im not saying good will hunting is a bad film at all,positive
its a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments and lots of great things about it,positive
the acting is amazing with two oscarnominationworthy performances from damon and williams who have amazing chemistry together,positive
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg rd great name ben affleck and from minnie driver who plays wills love interest skylar,positive
there are tons of individual moments that i adored,positive
i loved all the comedy in the film especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks his various attempts at therapy and of course my favorite scene in the entire film the one where he delivers a long exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them,positive
i liked the relationship between some of the people like will and skylar will and sean sean and lambeau and will and his friends,positive
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch,positive
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal that i felt rightfully uncomfortable,positive
like the breakup scene between will and skylar will and seans first meeting a bar scene between sean and lambeau and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesnt regret meeting his first wife who would later suffer a slow painful death and leave him lonely and slightly bitter,positive
however the main flaw of the film is theres too much of everything and not enough of it either,positive
the film tries for deeper relations between the characters but theyre sometimes either overwritten or underwritten,positive
take for example the relationship between sean and will the film gets an interesting as well as relationship going with out any problems but when it tries to show them as equals it falls on its face,positive
we hear how they went to the same town and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times,positive
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do,positive
also wills relationship with his best friend chuckie affleck has a nice climax but not enough rising action,positive
we see them joking around but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one,positive
their relationship never goes beyond just best friends and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more human,positive
maybe it was just me,positive
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau but that again is underwritten,positive
and of course as in most films like this the relationship is pretty underwritten,positive
we never understand what they see in each other so when skylar confesses that she loves him it seems more like its there for plot details that anything else,positive
minnie driver is interesting though and breathes life into her character,positive
the writing is a bit at fault here but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness,positive
sure it feels overstuffed but its extremely enjoyable,positive
the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh and seems extremely human,positive
i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue which is amazing,positive
while this is probably director gus van sants most conservative film youd hardly know its the same director of to die for the only van sant film ive seen really its still a pretty remarkable film albeit a tad overrated whats this best picture deal,positive
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
like its own opening shot from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent,positive
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking,positive
the film follows a softspoken young man eddie adams mark wahlberg from torrance through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom and later to a harrowingly precipitous drop,positive
as boogie nights opens hes toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity,positive
recruited by fatherly jack horner a rejuvenated burt reynolds a successful porn filmmaker eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler pornstar,positive
wholeheartedly embraced by jacks troupe including the maternal amber waves julianne moore reed rothchild john c reilly buck swope don cheadle rollergirl heather graham dirk and his one special thing are quickly propelled to the top of his field fulfilling his mantra of being a big bright shining star,positive
his lack of discipline however incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in,positive
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr anderson whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious,positive
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool mr andersons accomplished command of the camera is without question,positive
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating impertinent and selfcongratulatory case in point marc roccos unforgettable perpetualmotion helming of murder in the first in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr anderson be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp is purposeful and potent,positive
its a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmakers career boogie nights is only his second feature film following up his debut feature from earlier this year hard eight and although its somewhat derivative his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman while in terms of visuals hes clearly influenced by martin scorsese at least hes borrowing from some of the best and its entirely effective within the context of this film,positive
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective in terms of sheer entertainment value its also rollicking good fun with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour,positive
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music clothes hairstyles dance idioms and culture aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent preaidsscare period in american history where uninhibited freewheeling lifestyles abounded,positive
while much of the films humour pertains to the characters obliviousness of nowoutdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society a prime example is parttime salesman buck swopes demo of a stereo system with an eighttrack tape and inviting a prospective customer to get freaky deaky with the music its elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule but of wistful reminiscence and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous,positive
a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny to be sure but oddly magical and the sequence which lovingly explores s bedroom completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures farrah fawcett cheryl tiegs bruce lee is breathtaking,positive
ably supported by a wellselected collection of period music all of which purportedly came straight from mr andersons personal collection theres a clear affection for the era in boogie nights,positive
its the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline the films promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters,positive
after the debacle with 1996s milos forman film the people vs,positive
larry flynt another finelycrafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornographyrelated storyline the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public,positive
however while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago its hardly a lurid or seamy film given the subject matter theres very little nudity and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality but simply as a business,positive
the glimpses on the sets of jack horners shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate theres a candid matteroffactness in terms of sex his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job and its refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking such as coercion or debauchery are avoided,positive
if anything boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves,positive
jack horners dream is an honourable one he genuinely aspires to make a great film and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence,positive
in both films the world of quickie lowbudget filmmaking is explored and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton scott alexander and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets jacks retort of there are shadows in light baby to his cinematographers complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed woods its not about the little details its about the big picture,positive
rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false,positive
in boogie nights and ed wood the aspirations of the respective filmmakers prove to be bemusing not in their intentions theres nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an artistic erotic picture but in the degree that they miss the mark,positive
much like the humour lacing ed wood the laughs involving jack horner are doubleedged after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres when jack breathes this is the best work ive ever done its genuinely funny but given his utter sincerity also possesses a tinge of sadness,positive
mr anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter,positive
while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging there really isnt any clever dialogue in the film though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the films characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges when one considers that the films protagonist literally doesnt say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time its no wonder why the playfully inane how much can you bench,positive
banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the films finest exchanges,positive
and while mr anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters its problematic that some of the the threads given to the films characters are simply stale material julianne moores child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff better suited for a less risque and uninspired tvmovie version of her characters story and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions,positive
still even if he doesnt always know what to do with his characters mr anderson most definitely captures their essences and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious misguided even aimless hopelessly naive selfdestructive insufferable i loved them just the same,positive
in any case its hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired and ultimately bestexecuted scenes of the year a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loosecannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance even if its a small one in a suicidal drug deal scam only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night rangers sister christian on his stereo system is sheer brilliance flanked by an armed bodyguard,positive
if this scene already wasnt tense enough with these elements mr anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room pushing the scene to a new surreal level of delightful giddiness,positive
there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights,positive
mr anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight here it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect,positive
similarly a painful scene where crew member scotty j philip seymour hoffman breaks down in tears in the drivers seat sobbing im so stupid after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the drivers seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening,positive
boogie nights is exceedingly well cast and each of the actors rise to the occasion the ensemble cast is uniformly good,positive
while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr wahlberg fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films and mr reynolds terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film ringing true in every respect a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention,positive
mr reilly demonstrates here as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbards georgia a genuine aptitude for comedy many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film,positive
im not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee,positive
mr reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number and its wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation,positive
worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad and deadon period it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me demo track you got the touch in a vain attempt at a musical career,positive
mr reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective,positive
ms graham with her long dirty blonde hair innocent demeanour and huge hazel eyes looks like a disney animated heroine come to life or in this case a disney animated heroine who came to life made a wrong turn and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s early 80s adult film industry,positive
consequently its a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweetfaced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates but in a scene where shes lounging in a limousine prowling the streets garish red lipstick messily smeared on giving the camera a hilariously pouty comehither look all one can do is gulp,positive
her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out err in a figurative sense shes essentially a glorified extra but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity,positive
if only mr anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face though,positive
and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish as a teen ms grahams parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers since then her most notable roles have been as a junkie gus van sants drugstore cowboy and now a porn starlet,positive
draw your own conclusions,positive
perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr cheadle who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion,positive
his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st vincent an interesting melora walters is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible its no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry,positive
while the scenario is familiar the wounded look in cheadles eyes makes the scene unforgettable,positive
luis guzmans most famous work is possibly in brian de palmas carlitos way and here he plays a variation on the same character maurice t rodriguez is a hapless but goodnatured nightclub owner whos a hangeron to jacks group ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack with little disguise made of his desperation for a part in one of his erotic pictures,positive
jacks eventual acquiescence to maurices request leads to one of boogie nights biggest comic payoffs,positive
boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr anderson who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work,positive
striking a fine balance between humour and drama and exceptionally wellcrafted theres no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year,positive
wong karweis fallen angels is on a purely visceral level one of the most exciting films ive seen in a long while,positive
unfortunately wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for,positive
ordinarily that alone would be enough to sink a movie but in the case of fallen angels this is not so,positive
every shot in this film is exciting just to look at,positive
wong does really interesting things with the camera but he doesnt allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over as was the case with last years dismal knock off which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe,positive
ugh,positive
the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives,positive
i cant say much more than that as i didnt really know what was going on most of the time,positive
in fact it wasnt until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character,positive
the constantly moving camera doesnt really allow for the audience to associate with any one character,positive
were always kept at a distance from these people i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters,positive
fallen angels is a refreshing changeofpace from most hollywood films which never bother to try anything different at least on a visual level,positive
in fact id go so far as to say that fallen angels is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film ive ever seen,positive
sure theres directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating,positive
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images,positive
there were far too many instances during fallen angels in which i asked myself now who are these people again,positive
is this that first couple or the second couple,positive
it was impossible to keep track,positive
perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which by introducing them to us with name cards as in scorseses mean streets,positive
thats really besides the point though,positive
wong karwei has proven himself through very few films thats hes a moviemaker to watch,positive
lets just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies,positive
plot derek zoolander is a male model,positive
he is also very dumb and impressionable,positive
for that reason he is secretly hired and trained so secret that even he doesnt know about it by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia who wants to abolish child labor in his country,positive
will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed,positive
will zoolander ever grace the world his new look,positive
is this a funny movie,positive
find out below,positive
critique theres a place in our world for stupid comedies,positive
films which dont pretend to take themselves seriously are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes,positive
theres also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history might be an ideal circumstance during which to relax by watching something so completely frivolous,positive
well if youre in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time,positive
of course comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny while others will grant them the stupid but consider it funny instead,positive
i personally enjoyed it for the most part cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry,positive
snap,positive
it was also nice to see several reallife models with small roles in the movie not taking themselves too seriously,positive
and if youre the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films well dont look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn billy zane winona ryder christian slater david duchovny natalie portman and many many others,positive
i especially liked andy dicks complete makeover as the masseuse,positive
hilarious,positive
but with all films of this type there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesnt work,positive
a few particulars which didnt strike my fancy included the bulimia and orgy sequence with christine taylor the breakdance fighting and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this why not just make up a country instead of zeroing in on a certain people,positive
i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general since she wasnt all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then more zoolander dude,positive
but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me,positive
i almost pissed myself during the gas station disaster absolutely adored the walkoff contest with david bowie as the judge no less and appreciated many of zoolanders moronic oneliners i was a merman a,positive
merman,positive
and i dare you to get his monkey photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie youre a monkey derek a,positive
monkey,positive
i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film both of which zipped and zagged and established a nice rhythm to it all,positive
again its to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well,positive
if you thought the trailer was dumb skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something a film from which there is an obvious influence here,positive
blue steel baby yeah,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
austin powers 710 austin powers 2 710 deuce bigalow 710 dude wheres my car 710 freddy got fingered 510 jay silent bob strike back 810 joe dirt 510 meet the parents 810 say it isnt so 310,positive
one of the last entries in the longrunning carry on series carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a caravan site,positive
professors anna vrooshka elke sommer and roland crump kenneth williams and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep kenneth connor so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains,positive
anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick for instance when anna is asking for scrubbers for dirty caravan she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan,positive
arthur upmore bernard bresslaw and his wife linda patsy rowlands take her mother daphne barnes joan sims and her minah bird on holiday with them,positive
motherinlaw jokes prevail,positive
furthermore the trouble that joe and norma baxter ian lavender and adrienne posta have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families,positive
fred ramsden windsor davies and ernie bragg jack douglas leave their wives liz fraser and patricia franklin behind for a fishing holiday,positive
however they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls sandra carol hawkins and carol sherrie hewson,positive
the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the daytoday running of the camp the search for the minah bid and greyhound the major fred and ernies desperate need of a woman a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan parks pub and a shock in store for daphne,positive
the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing,positive
this is what binds the movie together,positive
joan sims stands out as the demanding motherinlaw bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast,positive
on the other hand there are lowkey performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen,positive
even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors,positive
although the regular cast is depleted the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film,positive
a relative flop at the cinema this movie deserves a lot more recognition,positive
the booming introduction music finishes and the camera sweeps over red mountains,positive
we see two figures looking over a barren and very red landscape,positive
they kiss then walk on,positive
one of the characters schwarzenegger slips and falls,positive
the glass on his mask cracks,positive
his face scruches up and his eyes begin to pop,positive
then doug quaid played by schwarzenegger wakes up,positive
its all been a dream,positive
he wakes up next to his beautiful wife played by stone and the film begins,positive
total recall is a typical scifi film wrapped around an intresting if far fetched plot,positive
quaid who has never been to mars keeps on having dreams of the planet which has now been colanised,positive
one day while riding on a train hes sees a ad for a company called rekall which implants memories of a holiday instead of you actually going there yourself,positive
quaid chooses the secret agent on mars memory and then the s really hits the fan,positive
the implant goes wrong and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes until he goes back to normal and cant remember a thing,positive
however everyone he knows his workmates his wife turn against him saying how blabbed about mars and blew his cover on the mission a strange man called richter played by ironside wants to kill him,positive
quaid now hopelessly confused follows the advice given to him by a friend,positive
he gets his ass to mars,positive
mars is ruled by cohagen played by cox who charges people for air,positive
against him are the rebels who are mainly mutants,positive
the rebels need quaid to defeat cohagen because quaid knows but cant remember yet about a reactor that produces air,positive
eventually quaid kills cohagen turns on the reactor saves the planet and goes away with a beautiful girl just like the guy at rekall promised him,positive
throughout this plot there is huge explosions thousands of deaths and i mean a lot of death swearing sex and everything else that makes a good verhoeven director of basic instinct and starship troopers movie,positive
naturally theres some pretty imaginative deaths with arms getting ripped off someone getting drilled and heads exploding,positive
as you can tell its violent stuff,positive
but its done so stylishly and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner thats it excusable,positive
the acting is variable,positive
arnie of course is useless but he goes has some good lines and in the first twenty minutes he even acts like a normal bloke not like some action hero,positive
stone of course is useless making a pretty poor wife and a pretty poor action hero,positive
but she does sex scenes alright,positive
ticoton most recently seen in con air again is ok doing some good action but getting her emotions all wrong,positive
one minute she hates quaid the next she loves him and she never gets this tranisition right,positive
so the good guys are awful,positive
but the bad guys are excellent,positive
cox is basically reprising robocop but hes still great in this and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end,positive
ironside is superbly evil with an utterly emotionless face,positive
the supporting cast are fine and not even the comedy sidekick this time in the form of a taxi driver is annoying,positive
one disappointing aspect though are the special effects,positive
ilm and dreamquest do some good work such as a subway station scene but the model work is not so good,positive
some of the model heads look appaling fake and quatto is a major disappointment,positive
another irritating thing is the product placement,positive
there are a lot of plugs and a good mars today gag however the sets look great and the special effects at the end of the film arent too bad either,positive
theres also a good soundtrack running through by jerry goldsmith the omen poltergeist star trek the motion picture,positive
overall then total recall is a hugely violent yet hugely enjoyable action fest with a reasonable plot thrown in there too some great bad guys and some imaganitive death,positive
for a schwarzenegger movie this is not bad at all,positive
in fact its very good,positive
a wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and in its theme,positive
the scene of second best is laid in wales,positive
james chris cleary miles is a 10yearold boy who must live in a home because his father keith allen is in prison and his mother committed suicide,positive
james is a mentally unbalanced child,positive
he cant forget what happened in the past and he dreams of living a happy life with his beloved father,positive
in the home he feels sadly and lonely,positive
one day a social worker alan cumming tells him of a person who wants to adopt him,positive
this person is graham holt william hurt,positive
graham manages a post office and shop in a village,positive
he is a single and hasnt any real friends,positive
his mother is dead and his father is ill and will die,positive
graham feels that he has been a disappointment to his parents,positive
there has never been real love between his parents and him,positive
grahams monotonous life would get a new sense if he could adopt james,positive
but graham has not only to convince the institutions but must also win the love of james,positive
james and graham have to open theirselves,positive
they must get to know each other and learn to understand and trust the other person,positive
james and graham aid each other to cope with their problems,positive
but will their relationship really have a future,positive
second best is based on a novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay,positive
the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good antiapartheid drama a world apart 198788,positive
and maybe second best is even a greater picture,positive
this precise richly detailed sensitively and convincingly directed study about a special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness,positive
the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and communication,positive
william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt,positive
and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of the boy,positive
the supporting cast is also fine especially jane horrocks as debbie a social worker who is charged to examine grahams living circumstances,positive
second best is an underestimated masterpiece,positive
its a pity that films like this one are made so seldom,positive
i eagerly await menges next directorial work the lost son which will star daniel auteuil,positive
modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the popbroadway musical rather than victor hugos original tome,positive
adapted several times for the cinema this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters story and heart of the novel to the screen,positive
liam neeson stars as jean valjean,positive
as a young man valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes,positive
prison hardened him and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor,positive
however an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life and he vows to become a better man,positive
however he runs up against one man who doesnt believe in reform,positive
inspector javert geoffrey rush is an obsessive law abider,positive
he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules even with benign intentions,positive
he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served and after valjean breaks his parole javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice,positive
two women also get caught up in the struggle,positive
fantine uma thurman is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society,positive
her daughter cosette mimi newman and later claire danes is her life yet she cannot afford to raise her,positive
instead cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave,positive
director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugos novel which though omitting some of the political undertones remains true to the overall story and tone of the book,positive
hopefully you wont as some clueless members of the audience did wonder where all the songs went,positive
the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes,positive
the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles,positive
neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good but continually haunted by his past,positive
the supporting cast is also extraordinary,positive
the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson playing the revolutionary marius,positive
the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair but it is transitory and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film,positive
the novel les misirables is by any account an epic both in its scope and in its length,positive
while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation,positive
it too is an epic and one worth seeing,positive
suffers from the damnedifyoudo damnedifyoudont syndrome,positive
after a spate of flighty cookiecutter teen films the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story,positive
but rather than applaud the production early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown afterschool special,positive
even worse in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people the studio got a case of the heebiejeebies and forced director john stockwell to reshoot scenes and cut footage to tone things down,positive
needless to say the filmmaker was frustrated,positive
we were trying to make a cautionary tale he told newsweek and we couldnt show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from,positive
regardless the film works thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes,positive
is quality fare good enough that i halfexpected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes,positive
set in pacific palisades calif the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens,positive
every morning and evening carlos nunez jay hernandez takes a twohour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school,positive
an honor student and star athlete carlos is responsible modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy,positive
all is well until he meets nicole oakley kirsten dunst the daughter of a rich congressman bruce davison,positive
nicole is a drunk apparently hellbent on selfdestruction,positive
carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her but he is only human and she has the greatest smile,positive
plus as her father notes she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral,positive
as with save the last dance god how i hate lowercase titles takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh,positive
while noting the racial and social differences between the kids the screenplay dances around most of the clich s there are still several mtv moments though,positive
the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there,positive
cuteasabutton dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicoles behavior,positive
she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down i hoped the boy would listen,positive
as carlos hernandez is a revelation,positive
hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team the young man can really act we will see a lot of this guy in the future,positive
aside from its title the biggest problem with is its ending which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy,positive
after carefully presenting credible characters and situations the conclusion feels rushed and lazy,positive
still this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots,positive
afterschool special my ass is the real deal,positive
as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on dday the weary seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat,positive
they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen,positive
one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck,positive
as the flap falls the battle begins,positive
they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire,positive
amid the chaos of this massacre stands a shot that at least for me hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindlers list,positive
a soldier clearly missing an arm wanders around the bodystrewn beach like a lost puppy,positive
we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself,positive
he bends over picks up his arm and starts to carry it probably not bothering to ask himself what now,positive
saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film,positive
the direction is out of this world surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar,positive
the cinematography by janusz kaminsky is also astounding,positive
but be forewarned this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen,positive
the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get,positive
the question is does the story and its realism justify the excessive use,positive
the answer from my point of view is no,positive
braveheart was a truly gritty and one would imagine realistic battle film,positive
ryan is ten times worse,positive
expect disembowelments sucked in skulls heads blown to bits arms and legs flying across the battlefield,positive
many in the theater could not bear to watch,positive
and it is a shame too because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year,positive
but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters and academy members,positive
saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on dday 1944 through into the films primary mission,positive
captain miller hanks assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider private ryan whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield,positive
the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs ryan doesnt recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons that no person should suffer such injustice,positive
millers crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan though they dont yet know him,positive
they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesnt have any more or less right to live than any of them,positive
this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and though there is a lot of set up between battles the story continues full speed to the end,positive
the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of its own,positive
spielberg though not a student of the quick cut school of filmmaking takes a stab at it here and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it,positive
bay should pay close attention take copious notes,positive
if you want to jump cut every two seconds do it the way spielberg does it in ryan,positive
in the end the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the importance of the film,positive
schindlers list taught many people the truth about the holocaust,positive
it opened eyes sparked debate and study,positive
though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before they dont amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindlers list,positive
overall this is just the truest depiction of the old adage war is hell,positive
but braveheartdosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again,positive
masterful work marred only by excessive gore,positive
good films are hard to find these days,positive
great films are beyond rare,positive
proof of life russell crowes onetwo punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller is one of those rare gems,positive
a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting an intelligent script and masterful directing together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days genuine motivation in a story that rings true,positive
consider the strange coincidence of russell crowes character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryans character in the film all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world,positive
i havent seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpahs masterpiece the getaway,positive
but enough with the gossip lets get to the review,positive
the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman david morse an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by antigovernment soldiers,positive
upon discovering his identity the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for 6 million,positive
the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off and no one will step forward with the money,positive
with no choice available to her bowmans wife alice ryan hires terry thorne crowe a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative to arrange the return of her husband,positive
but when things go wrong as they always do in these situations terry and his team which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year david caruso take matters into their own hands,positive
the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent characterdriven vehicle filled with wellwritten dialogue shades of motivation and convincing acting by all the actors,positive
the script is based on both a book the long march to freedom and a magazine article pertaining to situations and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy screenwriter of the devils advocate and dolores claiborne,positive
the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan but that between crowe and david caruso,positive
dug out from bmovie hell caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowes right hand gun while providing most of the films humor,positive
ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic gunslinger character of terry thorne,positive
the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes,positive
the bulk of those scenes which bookend the movie work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the storys characters,positive
the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise,positive
director taylor hackford mixes both his oldschool style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film,positive
proof of life is a thinking mans action movie,positive
it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war and the sacrifices one makes for those choices the sacrifices that help you sleep at night,positive
the premise of wag the dog is so simple that its adequately explained by the commercials,positive
with 11 days to go until the election the president who we never see calls in political dirtytricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal,positive
deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a pageant a phony war against albania fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville with woody harrelson as the reluctant psychotic hero,positive
and if there wasnt anything more to the movie than this it would be a secondrate heist comedy at best enlivened by great actors like sneakers goes to washington,positive
a heist comedy,positive
yup,positive
deniro and hoffman are stealing the election so to speak and the movie is more about how they do it and the fun they have doing it than anything else,positive
wag the dog succeeds because its based one great truth the american people are stupid,positive
ok maybe its not love thy neighbor as thyself or even two plus two makes four but a truth nonetheless,positive
any average person who thinks that theyre really smart about the two things this movie satirizes moviemaking and the political process is invited nay challenged to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching cspan when the house is in session,positive
and because were so utterly predictably stupid hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo washington knows that we wont notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies and deniros character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we wont be able to locate albania on the map,positive
the beauty of wag the dog is that it isnt a light meaningless comedy about politics like speechless the michael keaton geena davis picture or from the level of lighthearted politcal satire to neargreatness,positive
nor is it a hardedged cynical look at the manner in which a morallydeprived ethically challenged babyboomer connives his sleazy way into the white house like primary colors and yes i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out thanks for asking,positive
instead david mamets script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire,positive
it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers schemes come off beautifully and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion,positive
deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables without any of the violent rages,positive
its all what do i love,positive
what is it that brings me joy,positive
baseball minus the savage bloody beating with the bat,positive
he threatens a lot of people mind you but hes doing it in a very nice polite way,positive
its a very mellow restrained performance which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script,positive
hoffman on the other hand is giddy exuberant and joyous,positive
this kind of thing is what his character lives for and hes so excited that he cant even shut up,positive
even on the edge of disaster hes brighteyed behind oddly tinted sunglasses and positive,positive
insiders note that hes basing his character on some powerfulbutanonymous producer which may or may not be true but hoffman still exudes the kind of letsputonashow electricity that you figure a producer needs to have,positive
the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast,positive
the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them listen to them talk in that wisedup mamet dialogue get to know them better which we dont,positive
anne heche is deadbangon in her portrayal of a political press aide cool and composed on the outside panicked and frenzied on the outside,positive
denis leary one of my favorite actors see the ref is the fad king who handles the profitable backend tshirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative innovative ways to separate a fool from his money,positive
they could make a whole movie just about the fad king and id go see it,positive
willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song to the weepy country waltz to the hilarious ballad of the green berets parody,positive
woody harrelson has a brief but memorable part as the overmedicated hero of the albanian conflict,positive
craig t nelson as the opposition candidate and the everreliable william h macy as a wacky cia agent are given surprisingly short shrift,positive
one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing,positive
wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems the trivialization of american politics the role of the press in dumbing down the issues the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars the list goes on,positive
we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens,positive
wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we dont,positive
it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child whether that may be in life or in death,positive
after having said that i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well,positive
one gets that choking sensation in the throat because of grief when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement,positive
there is no ocean no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ordinary people,positive
in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing not that this literally happened in the movie,positive
so what are the lessons learnt 1,positive
dont take your children to class reunions,positive
2 dont leave them alone in the lobby not even for a second,positive
michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highlystrung wife and mother a trend that started with a thousand acres and one fine day,positive
my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie so much so that when she has a nervous break down the veins on her temples bulge impressively,positive
whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance playing a lesbian cop with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop,positive
lastly who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie my grandmother comes to mind,positive
that thing you do,positive
r tom hankss screenwriting and directorial debut that thing you do has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment fun lively and ohsonice,positive
it is the latter quality however that becomes a hindrance for this 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast,positive
that thing focuses on the wonders a teen rock band from erie pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called of course that thing you do,positive
the groups members are naturally a diverse group theres brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy johnathon schaech girlcrazy lenny steve zahn the lead guitarist a goofy geeky type known only as the bass player ethan embry and the films center guy tom everett scott the drummer who has aspirations in jazz,positive
along for the wonders ride to success is jimmys perpetually neglected galpal faye liv tyler,positive
hanks proves to be a capable writerdirector deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 which hanks calls the last innocent year,positive
the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music which like the other recent period music film grace of my heart was expressly written for the film hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunesbut not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled its still playing in my mind as i write this,positive
it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors eliciting charming likable work from the entire cast most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler who is remarkable in delivering the films biggest and best dramatic moment,positive
the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early 60s they do not appear to be 90s grungers playacting retro,positive
yet for all the light frothy charms of that thing you do its nearly nice to a fault,positive
while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting,positive
everyone is so happy basking in the glow of overnight success marvelling at it allexcept toward the end but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness ending on an appropriately feelgood note,positive
there isnt much of an edge throughout that thingthe only thing that is remotely edgy is hankss turn as the wonders managerand thus becomes in danger of being so nice its bland,positive
but a little niceness goes a long way these days and theres no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do its just about impossible to hate,positive
its an inoffensive enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming if not singing that thing you do quite,positive
possibly for days,positive
to paraphrase a passage from the song though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play that thing you do,positive
in 1987 the stock market crashed and oliver stones wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses,positive
wall street lucked out in its timing the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had and though its killorbekilled approach to business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reaganera businessman,positive
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs evil tale relayed in the fastpaced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange,positive
critics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic,positive
im proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them,positive
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stones output with its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen,positive
stone goes for broke in every scene the same could be said for nearly all of his works,positive
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions,positive
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane,positive
its all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like,positive
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative as they are presented in boiler room rather than laughably over the top,positive
these guys are salesmen after all not televised judges,positive
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street,positive
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date,positive
and not just the timeliness of the greed is good subject matter the film was plumped down in the eighties a decade in which the onejoke comedy rose to an art form and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies,positive
in my mind the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes,positive
maybe stones after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace,positive
boiler room is an equally welltimed film with some similarities to stones piece of crap,positive
they both feature a consequential fatherson relationship though boiler rooms is much more subtle and touching,positive
and they are both concerned with the power of greed yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slipperysmooth heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street,positive
boiler room is a message movie as well though at least until the end doesnt shove it in our faces,positive
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash,positive
as i said this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasnt been seen in quite a while not only do we want to be millionaires we want to watch other people become millionaires,positive
in our superjudgmental poweroriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have it all,positive
and seth giovanni ribisi wants it all the easy way,positive
hes a wellintentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon he meets others just like him,positive
ben affleck is cast as jim the company headhunter who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko,positive
his job is to influence trainees into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood,positive
its ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b s that theyre told to dish out to prospective buyers,positive
afflecks character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwins similar character in glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental to the actors performance,positive
affleck shouts curses and belittles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge,positive
when alec played the scene he became the part spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own,positive
by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading,positive
the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game,positive
rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters,positive
they arent above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes,positive
we drink up this world along with seth and watch him become seduced by it just like we might be,positive
as in all cautionary tales boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness,positive
i know this story,positive
we all do,positive
but it can work if its told with intelligence and energy and that is how writer director ben younger tells it,positive
as a director of please excuse my french miseenscene younger has much to learn,positive
his style is sitcom bland,positive
but his writing isnt,positive
youngers script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch his dialogue is like a junior david mamet,positive
despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script,positive
the brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock,positive
these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isnt aware that he is one,positive
with the exception of afflecks brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional,positive
ribisi who has the edgy looks of a character actor is extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth,positive
he conveys childlike vulnerability his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things arent going his way in some scenes and in others hes ferociously cut throat,positive
the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie ribisi is confident when its just him and the phone but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played by ron rifkin,positive
boiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics in the salespitch sequences the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys,positive
those ploys are taught to seth by chris vin diesel a kind broker who alternates between seths friend and his mentor,positive
diesl shines in his minor role,positive
this week i saw the scifi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner,positive
in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80s and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70s,positive
nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he cant have,positive
nia long as the firms secretary a lone black women amongst many white men is ribisis love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting,positive
the two make an oddly likeable couple,positive
long is smart and brash and ribisi is charmingly aloof,positive
at one point he says to her im just lookin for some chocolate love,positive
its a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous childlike way it becomes sweetly endearing,positive
unfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy,positive
there is much crying hugging and sorrowful stares,positive
this is okay when taken in small doses but youngers conclusion is constructed as a series of these boohoo moments one following the other,positive
a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seths manipulations have on one of his poor victims,positive
its not a bad idea but the execution is lacking with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message,positive
that message being greed is bad,positive
yes its patently obvious but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i havent seen much of in the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur,positive
and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners,positive
boiler room offers neither extreme,positive
it gives us what is in between and for that i am thankful,positive
the coen brothers are back again this time with homers odyssey as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in o brother where art thou,positive
right for the beginning of o brother the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song,positive
the camera flows around the hard toiling men giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes ulysses everett mcgill george clooney delmar tim blake nelson and pete john turturro escaping across a cotton field,positive
it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio,positive
a strong suite as always with the coen brothers is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films,positive
their characters are goofy and comical like nicolas cage in raising arizona or dramatic as albert finney and john turturro in millers crossing and even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in fargo,positive
in all cases and in o brother too the characters populating their films are threedimensional people,positive
ulysses everett is a handsome hairobsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department,positive
but he seems like a genius when compared to the simple sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of 1 2 million,positive
their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homers original material as they meet all manner of people along the way including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money,positive
there is magic too when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens,positive
the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys adventures giving the flick a choppy episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow,positive
some of the interludes are an epiphany though,positive
the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitarplaying tommy johnson chris thomas king and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere run by its blind owner stephen root,positive
they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and without their knowledge are recorded as they sing the traditional tune i am a man of constant sorrow,positive
it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us in my mind the best movie song of the year,positive
contrasting this and other wonderful moments the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of o brother,positive
in particular near the end is a scene where ulysses delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched,positive
the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of the wizard of oz,positive
they dont say lions and tigers and bears oh my,positive
and theres no dorothy but it is the land of oz were seeing here,positive
the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels,positive
george clooney is funny charming a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today,positive
he has the charm of a 30s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity,positive
ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets,positive
his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical herowanderer,positive
while clooney is the name draw for o brother the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar,positive
the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who at one point hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism,positive
delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine,positive
the taciturn pete as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst,positive
all together the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons albeit brave ones,positive
the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys odyssey,positive
charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy odaniel who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for reelection,positive
john goodman is wicked as the oneeyed bible salesman and con artist big dan teague,positive
michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary george babyface nelson,positive
stephen root is amusing as the blind dj reping one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways,positive
holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses estranged wife penny and the real reason for this adventure not secret treasure,positive
techs are as expected in a coen brothers venture first class,positive
cinematographer roger deakins who has worked on five previous coen films captures the sultry atmosphere of the south,positive
the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres respectively,positive
once again roderick jaynes the alter ego of ethan and joel coen is on board as editor,positive
the high points outweigh the low through most of o brother where art thou,positive
with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music,positive
i give it a b,positive
titanic is without a doubt the best movie ive seen all year,positive
and believe me im not an easy critic to impress the english patient was too long men in black was overhyped and several of the big summer releases were dead in the water,positive
thank god this film got delayed until december,positive
its my christmas present,positive
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of yearsgoneby and it is truly a stunning film,positive
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized never taking your eyes off the screen nor checking your watch to see how much longer its gonna last despite its 3 hour plus running time,positive
as a friend of mine whos a true titanicbuff said if someone doesnt like this film its because they didnt want to,positive
truer words are hard to come by,positive
of course it doesnt hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors james cameron who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time,positive
if you wish to argue that point with me look at his list of credits the terminator aliens the abyss terminator 2 true lies etc still care to disagree,positive
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film he also wrote produced and edited it,positive
and to show his true faith for the project he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs,positive
its obvious he truly loves titanic,positive
the film opens with footage both real and fake of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the heart of the ocean which according to bill paxtons character would be worth more than the hope diamond today,positive
their search turns up dissapointly no diamond but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond,positive
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose who claims to be the girl in the picture,positive
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond,positive
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past,positive
roses narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl engaged to a rich man named cal hockley billy zane that she didnt want to marry,positive
her mother is pushy and obnoxious and cal hockley is arrogant,positive
they are boarding the titanic which is sailing to america and this is where she is to marry cal,positive
meanwhile a young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his italian friend danny nucci win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game,positive
they are overjoyed and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving,positive
for them this is their ticket to america to a better life,positive
for rose she is sailing to her doom,positive
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt kate winslet and jack dawson fall in love,positive
its the classic wrongsideofthetracks story and does sometimes resort to a few cliches,positive
but as i said above the love portion isnt sappy and doesnt weigh the film down as some critics have said,positive
its sweet and it didnt make me restless at all despite the fact that i usually hate love stories,positive
of course it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen,positive
most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 including the enigmatic molly brown played by the talented kathy bates the captain of titanic bernard hill and so on,positive
all of these characters add an extra depth to the film and make it that easier to watch,positive
of course things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom,positive
the sinking is depicted realisticly and the effects are truly amazing,positive
it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either as people are portrayed as panicking pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats and drowning and dying horrible deaths,positive
the best part of the movie in my opinion comes at the very end when we flash back to the future,positive
the crew who at first had been skeptical of roses story now are totally aborbed by her,positive
rose goes out onto the ships ledge and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard,positive
we then see a dream of roses in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson,positive
most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream,positive
however i think it symbolized more i think it meant that rose had died and is going to a sort of heaven which would be the happiest part of her life her and her one true love jack,positive
if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this email me at venom8 com,positive
bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one,positive
the screenplay written by costar steve martin skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy sciencefiction movies to chopsocky fight sequences and all in a crafty and accomplished manner,positive
anyone who knows of or has had any association with moviemaking should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for its entire duration,positive
the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one,positive
bobby bowfinger martin a cheapskate and smalltime hollywood producer has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so,positive
a new script an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain has caught bowfingers eye,positive
after confronting a bigname producer named jerry renfro robert downey jr in a restaurant an agreement is made to finance the movie,positive
but first bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey eddie murphy to sign in on the project,positive
kit turns the offer down immediately but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film,positive
after emptying out his life savings the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved and then prepares to film the movie without the stars knowledge,positive
the actors confront ramsey on the street saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage,positive
the unknowing star who is terrified of aliens and being abducted is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him,positive
when the conditions become even more treacherous bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey lookalike named jiff also murphy a sweetnatured dork who runs for coffee inbetween shooting vital scenes,positive
these include attempting a suicide run across an 8lane freeway and one of the hot scenes involving supporting actress daisy heather graham removing her blouse,positive
bowfinger takes its sweet time getting started but when the plot switches into high gear great things happen,positive
certain scenes are so precisely executed perfectly framing moments that are absolutely falldown funny,positive
no hilarious,positive
standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey whos supposed to be being followed keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise its actually bowfingers dog in high heels,positive
and just try not to laugh in the climactic kungfu sequence featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas,positive
while the entire 97minutes of bowfinger isnt always on target individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles,positive
masterful comedy director frank oz dirty rotten scoundrels in and out who has never made a bad movie ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martins sharpedged script,positive
however the real onscreen star is eddie murphy,positive
this is the actors finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80s,positive
murphy excels at every corner not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well,positive
these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs,positive
steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger but murphy fuels it,positive
this is a summertime comedy that unlike something such as american pie and south park doesnt break any rules,positive
but its still just as uproarious or perhaps even more sidesplitting than anything weve seen this season,positive
the supporting cast including christine baranski as a workloving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman all perform well within their limits,positive
the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top,positive
graham attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers girl in ap2 displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay,positive
i wouldnt be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough,positive
while watching shallow grave i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens blood simple,positive
both are good films in which several characters none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes,positive
the body count rises and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands,positive
both films are also flawed but for different reasons,positive
blood simple is unrelentingly dark and moody but its characterizations were a little hollow,positive
shallow grave on the other hand is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes and then the filmmakers throw away much of what theyd accomplished for a more standard audiencepleasing ending,positive
the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end,positive
as the film begins we are introduced to alex ewan mcgregor juliet kerry fox and david christopher eccleston a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow,positive
they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch,positive
a man named hugo moves into the apartments remaining vacancy and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose,positive
juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash presumably from criminal activities,positive
the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death after a drawing of straws the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning,positive
all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film and part of what makes shallow grave so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next,positive
other than the obvious question of why they dont report the death and simply hide the cash which is not addressed the plotting and characterization while sometimes predictable worked in a way that kept my attention and on more than one occasion gave me chills,positive
i will therefore attempt to continue this review in a way that doesnt give away too much of the plot,positive
broadly the trio are in danger due to hugos underworld connections as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process,positive
a police inspector ken stott is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective,positive
david meanwhile becomes increasingly paranoid moves into the attic and develops an affinity for sharp objects,positive
director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other,positive
while i do not consider myself the happy endings are automatically stupid type i thought that shallow grave really should have ended in tragedy a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison in the mental hospital or in the morgue,positive
this could have been accomplished quite credibly but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional caper ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom and nothing more,positive
granted this isnt really a happy ending but its still pretty lighthearted compared to what preceded it,positive
i really shouldnt say anything more about the ending as far as details go but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable,positive
yes this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes but ultimately it left me feeling as if id been cheated,positive
still shallow grave was brilliant most of the way through and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller and i am therefore awarding it three stars,positive
i guess i just cant help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away,positive
elmore leonard has quickly become one of hollywoods favorite authors,positive
out of four film adaptations in as many years the witty and inventive out of sight gives get shorty a run for its money as the best leonard adaptation around,positive
george clooney stars as jack foley a nice bank robber you,positive
know the type he uses his charm and his wits rather than a gun,positive
but even charming guys end up unlucky and jack ends up in jail,positive
but not for long,positive
he plots an escape with the help of his best friend and fellow robber buddy bragg ving rhames and their slowwitted pothead associate glenn michaels steve zahn,positive
but jack didnt count on u s marshal karen sisco jennifer lopez,positive
appearing at the right place at the wrong time karen gets involved in foleys escape attempt and the subsequent manhunt to bring him in,positive
however karen develops a rapport with jack foley and finds that she begrudgingly likes the guy,positive
but can love prosper on opposite sides of the law,positive
or can karen straighten out jack before he goes too far in pursuit of just one last crime,positive
clooney who has had a string of solid but never stellar film roles delivers his best performance to date,positive
he blends into his role here perfectly as the risk taking jack foley whos willing to gamble everything on the chance that karen sisco might be his true love,positive
jennifer lopez does an excellent job as well,positive
she actually has a trickier role than clooney as a woman who has to balance her emotions with her sense of duty,positive
she and clooney develop good chemistry together,positive
the film boasts a superb ensemble,positive
steve zahn gives a hilarious performance and steals nearly every scene hes in,positive
don cheadle is appropriately sinister as a violent excon who may or may not be teaming up with foley,positive
albert brooks is enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much for his own good,positive
out of the cast only dennis farina seems underused as karens exlawman father,positive
steven soderbergh gives the film sharp and stylistic direction,positive
with an affectation for freeze frames he delivers a unique take on the films action and love scenes that places out of sight a notch above routine crime films,positive
a recurring series of flashbacks makes the film seem more complex than it actually is,positive
devoid of its bells and whistles out of sight is actually a fairly straightforward crime story,positive
however there are only a few spots in the film that seem bare and they pass quickly,positive
with smart dialogue good characters and an excellent cast out of sight easily smoothes over the rough spots in the plot and delivers on both the action and romantic fronts,positive
lean mean escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by,positive
most are unnecessarily complicated and others have no sense of expediency the thrillride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot,positive
perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive which featured none of the flashbang effects of todays market but rather a breadandbutter textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about,positive
the latest tony scott movie enemy of the state doesnt make it to that level,positive
its a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers without looking back,positive
although director scott has made missteps in the past such as the lame thriller the fan hes generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun,positive
that vibrant spirit is present here shown in welltimed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed,positive
enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views angles lenses and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie,positive
enemy is truly a visual experience and thats only one of the reasons its such a fun watch,positive
the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds jon voight,positive
reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee,positive
reynolds has the senator offed but not before the murder is caught on a naturalists camera,positive
by an extremist chain of events the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean will smith s posession and its not long before hes running from reynolds cronies,positive
its only with the help of an exspook named brill gene hackman that dean is able to get to the bottom of things,positive
the acting is top notch and the three principles smith hackman and voight are generally more mature and excellent all around,positive
smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role,positive
smiths regular joe comes off particularly well as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not,positive
the supports are also in fine form lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas,positive
this is for the holiday crowd the hot ticket as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking,positive
the reunion film is not an original idea in any way shape or form,positive
its been done throughout film history over and over again and has become one of the many subgenres like the prep school subgenre the angstfilled teen subgenre and the slasher subgenre,positive
what makes peters friends so remarkable is not how it doesnt follow the rules of this subgenre but how it follows it so well and creates characters that i wouldnt mind hanging with,positive
what are the rules of the reunion subgenre,positive
well,positive
1 you need a group of friends most of them married or at least dating and sometimes even married or dating eachother,positive
2 you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis,positive
3 they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart,positive
4 the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10,positive
5 they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic,positive
6 the reunion has to bring them together seperate them with little crises then bring them back together because after all theyre friends,positive
7 there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited,positive
8 eightly theyre all unhappy or marginally so,positive
9 theres some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them thats built up over the years,positive
10 the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts sometimes internationally so,positive
11 the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends sometimes causing them to get together in,positive
since it follows these rules so closely it will probably be and has been coined off as just a british big chill,positive
and in some ways it is,positive
both follow the rules as i said and both feature lots of bitching big confessionals and broken relationships,positive
but while the big chill was at least to me a tad too whiny and unsatisfying peters friends hits its mark making this film funny dramatic and poignant,positive
the friends of peters were all in the same theatre group back in 82 performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus,positive
after peters stephen fry wealthy father richard briers hardly on screen enough to register but oh well dies leaving a giant mansion to him he has to decide whether or not to keep it,positive
not sure what to do with it immeadiately he decides to throw a giant reunion party inviting back all his old chums,positive
of course all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule,positive
andrew kenneth branagh also directing here is an actor whos unhappily married to a tv star carol cowriter rita rudner,positive
maggie emma thompson is a successfuly publisher of selfhelp books but looks like she needs them more than her customers as she is lonely and unhappy,positive
roger and mary hugh laurie and imelda staunton who were also married in sense and sensibility are married and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died,positive
and sarah alphonsia emmanuel is as promiscuous as ever having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian tony slattery whos married and wants a divorce because of her giving her doubts,positive
as for peter things seem okay,positive
the film features lots of innerfriend jokes and even some old theatre anecdotes which i at least find a lot of fun in as ive done lots of theatre myself,positive
and there are big confessions brawls between the friends and by the end almost everyone is unhappy even though some have resolved their problems long before the end which i kinda dug,positive
the final twist would seem forced an anticlimactic but for some reason i felt the same way the rest of the friends did,positive
maybe its because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique,positive
thats really what makes peters friends so lovable the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes but when someones in crisis can come together wonderfully for one another,positive
its when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends and these people are true friends,positive
not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s a decade i grew up in unfortunately without taking us outside of the 90s,positive
there are some 80s classics and anticlassics like tears for fears everybody wants to rule the world but unfortunately no 80s songs i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film id put some crap go gos song on or at least some good old come on eileen but this is the british 80s were talking about,positive
oh well,positive
but anyway the direction is pretty good although nothing amazing,positive
branaghs forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical but at least hes very good with making a less ambiguous film like this,positive
the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman with lots of good oneliners and even some really bad but good puns to mock the fact that andrew lives in l a peter while cutting some logs asks him is he has wood in l a and andrew says no but we have hollywood punishment like that,positive
the actors as in most speaking movies are better than their material though with some standout performances to the six friends as well as the outsiders like slattery rudner and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peters mansion,positive
a little note should be made about hugh lauries performance as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this i mean ive never seen him actually act this dramatically,positive
peters friends is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion although i dont know what kind ill have like most people i dont look forward to my high school reunion,positive
because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that,positive
mars attacks,positive

many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day but even though the stories are similar they really are two distinctly different films,positive
however as a whole mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 and i loved id4,positive
you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film,positive
it is completely wackedout and unlike anything youve ever seen,positive
once the silly tone of the film is set its easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just dont mix,positive
the plot is simple martians invade the earth,positive
but its different than any other invasion film,positive
usually its the evil aliens versus the heroic humans,positive
this time however its the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans,positive
the martians who are all computer generated are just about the funniest things ive seen in a long time,positive
they look funny they move funny and their language is hilarious,positive
and about the special effects,positive
the effects in mars attacks,positive
are just about the most flawless ones ive seen to date,positive
the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100 real,positive
there are just a couple of scenes that dont work mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship,positive
also glenn close overacts tremendously in her thankfully very limited screen time so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise,positive
but there are many big laughs in the film as i said if you are in the right mood,positive
could it have been funnier,positive
certainly,positive
was it funny enough,positive
yes,positive
was i entertained,positive
absolutely,positive
on a personal note id like to thank whomever cast rod steiger my favorite actor in the film as warcrazy general decker,positive
finally after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see,positive
while hes not given the type of role that you can give a real performance in he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue,positive
the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him,positive
in recent years harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence scowling through the likes of tom clancys jack ryan series thefugitive and last years smash airforceone that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system,positive
apparently it was just lying dormant,positive
with ivan reitmans enjoyable romantic sixdays sevennights the lovable scoundrel is back giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons,positive
ford plays quinn harris a carefree and slightly slobby endearingly so pilot in the tropics whose brokendown plane crashes in a storm stranding him and his charter new york magazine editor robin monroe anne heche on a deserted island,positive
of course the sophisticated robin and the saltoftheearth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting,positive
while some of the lines fall flat the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche,positive
both actors who have largely done serious works as of late seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders and they deliver their zingers as weak as they sometimes are with beguiling abandon,positive
naturally theres nothing like a lifethreatening crisis to bring two people together and quinn and robins warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates,positive
granted some conflict needed to be introduced on the island but this tackedon development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes,positive
but the point is to get the two together and their newfound affection causes complications for both but mostly robin who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank david schwimmer who frantically awaits her return on the home island,positive
reitman and old reliable hand at breezy comedies keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more actionoriented sequences,positive
his big accomplishment however is bringing the old smiling ford back,positive
as appealing and charismatic as he always is ford hasnt been quite this charming and affable in years hes obviously having a blast and the audience cannot help but have one along with him,positive
holding her own is heche whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be as the plane goes down she frantically pops stress pills,positive
she can take her lumps physical and otherwise just as well as quinn making her a formidable foil and ideal match,positive
formulaic and light as a feather sixdays sevennights could be cited as a classic example of the summer popcorn movie seasons lack of substance,positive
its certainly fluff but its unpretentious undemanding andmost importantlyfun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach,positive
pass the popcorn,positive
richard gere is not one of my favorite actors,positive
however i like courtroom dramas and this film looked good enough to take a chance on,positive
i wasnt disappointed,positive
it wasnt a great film but it was interesting and took several unexpected turns,positive
one thing whats with the title,positive
not only is it extremely forgettable it doesnt really have much to do with the film as far as i could determine,positive
in the long run it will probably hurt the film as people wont be able to think of or remember it,positive
martin vail richard gere is a grandiose defense attorney,positive
he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending successfully rich scum such as mafia men and drugdealers,positive
once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a babyfaced alter boy he wants in on the case presumably for the press hell get,positive
we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover janet venable laura linney,positive
vail himself is a former prosecutor and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney played very well by john mahoney frasiers father on the tv series,positive
there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie people have public faces and private faces,positive
we see this in the murdered archbishop in the accused and most strongly defense attorney martin vail,positive
richard gere does a fairly good job,positive
at first he appears to be a money and attentiongrabbing lawyer with no consideration of the truth,positive
but we see another side as he becomes a seeker of justice and comes to believe in his client,positive
alfre woodard as the judge is capable though somewhat wasted in a standard role,positive
laura linney also does journeyman work nothing spectacular but acceptable,positive
her relationship with vail is believable their verbal fencing adds to the film,positive
the actor who playes vails investigator unfortunately i dont remember his name is quite good,positive
his female assistant she looked very familiar but i cant remember where ive seen her was also capable but unspectacular,positive
the best performance in the film was by edward norton,positive
he was excellent as the timid altarboy turned alleged butcher boy of st mikes,positive
i was impressed by the depth of the plot there are redherrings and deadends that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending,positive
i liked the plot twists the film took and most of the supporting characters thus i give primal fear a respectable b rating,positive
recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantvilleone from entertainment weekly one from a newsgroup and two from different online resources,positive
each review compared this film to the truman show,positive
why,positive
the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television,positive
other than that the two movies are completely different from each other,positive
reviewers seem to love to pick one movie i e,positive
the truman show obsess over it and make it a guideline for other movies,positive
when pleasantville and edtv opened all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman,positive
the same goes for the thin red line as well,positive
when it opened in decemeber probably 98 of reviews compared it to stephen spielbergs saving private ryan giving thin line no chance whatsoever,positive
critics loved private ryan so much that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards,positive
this is why i think pleasantville was underrated,positive
if the truman show had never been made pleasantville probably would have received better reviews done better at the box office and would be remembered after its long been on the video store shelves,positive
sure it wasnt perfect and it wasnt very believeable but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history,positive
with the exception of don knotts as the annoying tv repairman the film is cast perfectly the ice storms tobey maguire is david in real life he watches the old 50s sitcom pleasantville to escape from his feuding parents,positive
his twin sister jen reese witherspoon is a popular slut who steriotypically smokes and wears revealing clothes,positive
but what makes her character believeable is the dialoguethose excessive 90s terms such as like whatever and cool make her sound like the total dimwit shes supposed to be,positive
the twins with a little help from a tv repairman casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameoesque cast rather than a true acting one are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote,positive
their new parents played by william h macy and joan allen are perfect in every way,positive
their new names are bud and mary sue and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville,positive
after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles the movie begins to take form,positive
its just like watching a sitcom in itself you dont want it to end,positive
mary sue has sex with her date the school basketball champion when he tells all his friends about it they stop preforming perfectly at basketball and things start to take color,positive
soon we learn that these people dont know how to express true emotions and when they learn to do so they eventually turn into color,positive
this eventually sparks a racial war between the coloreds and the black whites,positive
entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has none of the depth poignance and brilliance of the truman show,positive
yes the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent,positive
but the racial settingintensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroomcertainly classifies as deep considering its what i least expected,positive
gary ross did not try to create an intelligent award masterpiecehe just tries to convey moral messages within his work,positive
take for example big and dave his past films,positive
bigbe careful what you wish for,positive
davegood or bad lying is still lying,positive
did these movies win big awards,positive
no but they won the heart of millions,positive
pleasantville could have done that too if it wasnt for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films,positive
pleasantville a ad2am i almost lost my nose and,positive
i like it,positive
i like breathing through it,positive
jack nicholson chinatown,positive
billy bob thornton who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer is becoming one of the most versatile and most accomplished american actors around at the moment,positive
as jacob the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxtons hank thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers,positive
three men hank paxton jacob thornton and their friend lou brent briscoe stumble upon a plane wreck which upon closer inspection yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money,positive
jacob and lou want to pocket the cash,positive
hank the smarter and perhaps more naive of the three insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find,positive
eventually they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found and then split the money three ways,positive
things start going wrong though with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan,positive
disaster is sure to strike,positive
director sam raimi of the evil dead and darkman fame has made an excellent and thoughtprovoking film worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name,positive
while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come,positive
scott b smiths screenplay based on his novel which i havent read is a fine example of escalating tension,positive
while it does remind one of danny boyles shallow grave without the abundance of black humour it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality or the lack thereof found in a film with this subject matter,positive
alar kivilos cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coens fargo with the bleak snowy landscape almost becoming another character,positive
danny elfman also does well with his moody finelywritten score,positive
if theres a flaw in the film its that it goes on for just a little too long,positive
just when we think that they are about to wrap things up raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further,positive
while this isnt really a bad thing it did become a little frustrating at times this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand,positive
the performances are excellent with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scenestealing turn as hanks scheming wife,positive
this is an excellent showcase for thorntons fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films,positive
fingers crossed though that this doesnt stop him from making another evil dead sequel,positive
set in the late 80s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie less than zero american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie genre that ellis helped to create,positive
christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc e and his colleagues,positive
it seems that bateman is a serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporaries his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip,positive
as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering coworkers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel,positive
i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school,positive
i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it,positive
as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out but i soon forgot about the novel and didnt end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore,positive
i picked it up and read it but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers,positive
the movie has a similar effect but at least its less cryptic than ellis novel,positive
for once a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on,positive
both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout,positive
the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in batemans impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does,positive
as a result the film is immensely more entertaining,positive
lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films having picked up kevin smiths catholicrattling dogma and here with american psycho there is no difference,positive
screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it,positive
some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc17 mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women and initial reports said the film was unwatchable,positive
thankfully it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park bigger longer uncut,positive
side note 1 cowriter guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an illfated acquaintance of batemans who after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute proclaims that shes not a lesbian nor has any interest in it,positive
the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner the of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy is a lesbian,positive
its a subtle injoke and its one i found to be pretty humorous,positive
despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young upandcomers including reese witherspoon most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos,positive
the real draw here is christian bale and his overthetop performance as patrick bateman,positive
whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters,positive
i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being,positive
to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that hes as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger,positive
one sequence in particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip to be square right before burying an axe in a coworkers head features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film,positive
side note 2 despite the fact that huey lewis hip to be square and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film dont expect to see them on the soundtrack release,positive
huey lewis expressly requested that his song featured in a rather large set piece in the film much akin to the use of stuck in the middle with you in reservoir dogs not be included on any soundtrack release,positive
im assuming that collins requested the same,positive
on a similar note whitney houstons cover of the greatest love of all is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isnt the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source,positive
apparently houston wasnt as open about the use of her song as the others were,positive
a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the films release that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film,positive
dont look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more,positive
several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but im still undecided,positive
there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops old ladies and cleaning staff with equal gusto,positive
the scene seemed very dreamlike and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying as an example bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car,positive
i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence though comic throws the film offbalance which i suppose was the intention,positive
other than the few flaws i have mentioned american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in batemans reality,positive
i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such,positive
it may not change anyones life but it will certainly have an effect,positive
i know i will certainly hear hip to be square in a different context the next time i hear it,positive
r,positive
when casting the key part of the voice of moses most peoples first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer the saint and the island of dr,positive
moreau but he was dreamworkss choice in their first traditionally animated movie the prince of egypt,positive
the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasnt in the casting department,positive
the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic a la cecil b demille to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones,positive
in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children,positive
animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies now that is something fresh,positive
let me admit upfront that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off,positive
dreamworkss antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group,positive
the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz but it is much more satisfying,positive
like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixars a bugs life the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices,positive
danny glover is the voice of jethro jeff goldblum of aaron steve martin of hotep helen mirren of the queen michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti,positive
you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god,positive
the movie which is weakest in the story department is a cliffs notes version of demilles the ten commandments,positive
the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in mosess life,positive
demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice,positive
at less than half of that the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesnt establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters,positive
we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket,positive
we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ralph fiennes the future pharaoh,positive
moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew,positive
all ive ever known to be true is a lie moses complains,positive
after finding out his real identity he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him,positive
after leaving egypt moses comes back to ask ramses to let mosess people go,positive
this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally handdrawn animation of the most of the production,positive
it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling,positive
drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses blues and golds the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last,positive
the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun,positive
the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has,positive
done with an explicit twodimensional look the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story,positive
even though it has its weaknesses the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family,positive
this aweinspiring movie deserves to be seen,positive
the prince of egypt runs about 1 30,positive
it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family,positive
how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child but those over 8 will probably like it,positive
vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents,positive
and unlike any of the more outlandish myths the vampire holds some realworld probability one study claims 1 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide and places 50 in los angeles,positive
but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys john carpenter would like to remind us that they are and always have been a truly frightening element of the thriller genre,positive
and remind us he does in his latest film vampires,positive
there was some question as halloween weekend approached of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinemas immensely successful blade released in august,positive
the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue and dont even agree on some basic points of the slaying method,positive
for instance blades main weapons are silver and garlic whereas main character jack crows technique is a wooden stake to the heart,positive
blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate,positive
both have their advantages and here carpenters style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered,positive
when its all said and done though the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish the level for gore is indeed set to maximum,positive
this time our hero is vaticansponsored slayer jack crow james woods,positive
hes a cynical battleworn veteran and the best of his bunch,positive
he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest and after exterminating a nest one night they run up against a supervampire termed a master named valek thomas ian griffith,positive
valek kills all of jacks team except for his partner tony montoya daniel baldwin and as the two regroup they learn that valek is the original vampire now over six hundred years old,positive
apparently valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime,positive
so with the aid of a priest named adam tim guinee and a bitten hooker sheryl lee as bait they track valek down for the final confrontation,positive
the script for vampires written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year,positive
crow in particular is a fun source of oneliners and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism,positive
baldwin lee and guinee are all fine supports adding to the character pool but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffiths bad guy,positive
griffiths intense expression is perfect for the role and the only downside is that hes got to talk sometime,positive
luckily hes got few lines and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance,positive
all said fans will surely be impressed by this picture and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one,positive
certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters,positive
the truman show paramount pictures running time 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait jim carreys dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen,positive
in case youve been asleep for the last few months the plot centres on truman burbank carrey who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven,positive
his life seems so perfect however because its controlled by christoff harris creator of the truman show the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of,positive
thats right burbanks life is being broadcast live to the american public and seahaven and all its inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage,positive
the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far,positive
with an idea so different it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator,positive
luckily the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie,positive
talking of carrey hes perfect in this movie enjoying the best role in his career,positive
his character is a reinforced stanley ipkiss from the mask 1994 and is completely suited to carreys persona,positive
he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode shrieking and being silly but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey,positive
hes not completely dramatic like the film promises however,positive
ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff the megalomaniac creator of the show,positive
quiet and well spoken he burns an image into the viewer,positive
unfortunately hes barely in the film and for the first hour dosent appear at all,positive
also disappointing is natascha mcelhones character sylvia,positive
she plays the role well but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her,positive
the supporting cast is excellent and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect so perfect its creepy,positive
the philip glass soundtrack is also superb and is used to great effect during the film,positive
peter weir keeps the film going clearly having fun,positive
the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card,positive
although it is slightly slow to begin with about half an hour into film the pace really picks up and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll,positive
sadly though the film is practically over when the film is in full steam,positive
also concerning the ending it is slightly too ambiguous which was disappointing,positive
the screenwriter andrew niccol who bought us gattaca 1997 delivers an entertaining script and manages to keep the plot in trim,positive
while christoffs plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly they never go over the line which would have been easy for niccol to do,positive
also theres some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show,positive
overall the truman show is excellent entertainment,positive
certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces it should be viewed by everyone,positive
it offers something to every member of the audience and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed,positive
overall rating,positive
review by david wilcock 1998,positive
you know for kids norville barnes,positive
there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original,positive
one of such masterpieces is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one,positive
its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day,positive
casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience,positive
one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail at least judging by conventional moviemaking wisdom of its time,positive
it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadnt been produced on stage screenplay by three writers julius g epstein philip j epstein and howard koch was beeing written as shooting went along the main actors were producers second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz was considered to be capable but not great director,positive
however the movie was commercially successful and earned three oscars including the one for the best film,positive
until this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in its own golden age,positive
the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story,positive
in december 1941 casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazicollaborating french vichy government,positive
thousands of refugees from wartorn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas,positive
many shady characters thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rains,positive
his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic antifascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody,positive
however everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas,positive
this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca,positive
one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe,positive
he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris,positive
the couple needs visas especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail,positive
rick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride selfpreserving interest and his own hatred of fascism,positive
the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status,positive
bogarts portrayal of rick as complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present was so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character,positive
another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime,positive
the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking some happier times when the romance on the screen didnt look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works,positive
for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made,positive
but the reason for that isnt the romance itself its the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choices in their life,positive
the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads,positive
the supporting actors also did a marvellous job,positive
sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic john hustons maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters,positive
another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny,positive
unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaves little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by coupling,positive
however rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca,positive
captain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime was embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm,positive
despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rains managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary,positive
rains also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renaults relationship towards rick and ricks final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations,positive
together with welldrawn characters and exciting story the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere,positive
professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable if not realistic,positive
any way even if we dont see it as a historical document casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration,positive
thats the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into the wedding singer the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus,positive
does he draw laughs from his sad puppy dog expression and donthatemeforbeingasimpleton observations,positive
or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people,positive
or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over,positive
well theres a little bit of all of that in the wedding singer and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr sandlers thing i did have a surprisingly good time,positive
thats because in a nutshell the wedding singer is one of the sweetest movies youre ever likely to come across,positive
thats right,positive
sweet,positive
the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laughoutloud hysterical but the tone,positive
well its just lovely,positive
i have to admit i was halfexpecting farting armpit humor gratuitous nudity superfluous cloying subplots and some nasty unnecessary violence,positive
instead,positive
well ive said it before,positive
sweet,positive
the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart the eponymous wedding singer a job aspiring rock stars often settle for,positive
when robbies fianc e dumps him at his own altar robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia drew barrymore who has some problems of her own shes marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who unbeknownst to her isnt that big on monogamy,positive
it isnt giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love,positive
aww,positive
sandler and barrymore are a good match and theyre assisted by some terrific cameo appearances including steve buscemi and jon lovitz whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film,positive
writer tim herlihy with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion,positive
it doesnt all work but its handled with such lightheartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans,positive
herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights sounds and affectations of the 1980s,positive
the soundtrackan everpresent force in the filmis packed with walltowall hits of the period new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idols white wedding to the smiths how soon is now,positive
to culture clubs do you really want to hurt me,positive
the mix of music and fashion would make the wedding singer a great double feature with boogie nights,positive
if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs then the wedding singer is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride,positive
if youre a fan of the lovable laughable adam sandler well,positive
lets just say that the wedding singer might well be the only film in recent memory to make me want to rent happy gilmore,positive
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer professor with such livedin naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance,positive
ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid80s,positive
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world,positive
youd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a goodnatured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open,positive
in wonder boys his performance isnt showy or a tour de force its simple yet truthful,positive
he embodies grady a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes,positive
grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map,positive
when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms,positive
grady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy,positive
their target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for,positive
leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions,positive
he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges,positive
hes portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is a little too calculated,positive
he reminds me of the selfimposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog,positive
whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white,positive
leer is similar a guy who equates quirks with depth,positive
tobey maguire fits well in the role,positive
with his round sweeteerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude,positive
but unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to hes a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility,positive
katie holmes plays hannah a beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in gradys pants,positive
this is a plot line i had trouble with,positive
douglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions,positive
at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe its because im jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth then i think of douglass real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones,positive
seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping,positive
suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and im pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas,positive
there is a movie in there somewhere,positive
grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell a droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor,positive
okay maybe not so chivalrous,positive
there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says she was a junkie for the printed word,positive
lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice,positive
robert downy j r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm,positive
downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual,positive
hes arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance,positive
the actor is perfectly cast here and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor,positive
i wish wonder boys had more of him,positive
searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but thats part of its charm,positive
and maybe im a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia a place im greatly fond of and a place rarely explored in american cinema,positive
everyone has a subgenre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen to be privy to,positive
im privy to films about literary types i e,positive
those individuals enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch,positive
the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points,positive
sometimes the dialogue is too clever but thats a problem i wish i found with films more often,positive
another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins to open up,positive
for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as a lowkey comedy for its chuckleworthy throwaway gags,positive
the gags are like those in the great robert altman m a s h the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do,positive
the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isnt ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things,positive
curtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated to more meaningful films,positive
he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up,positive
the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in a wonder boys party it fits,positive
the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen,positive
its the cinematic equivalent to a good read novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies,positive
many will find it slight but i found much to savor among its subtleties,positive
theres an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last,positive
george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy,positive
return of the jedi the final installment of the series is easily the most innovative actionpacked and entertaining of the three films,positive
the dark eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone,positive
instead for return of the jedi we have good triumphing decisively over evil a resolution to a love triangle and walking teddy bears,positive
even darth vader doesnt seem very intimidating this time around,positive
with the arrival of the emperor an apparitionlike creature played by ian mcdiarmid vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman,positive
return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back,positive
luke skywalker mark hamill princess leia carrie fisher lando calrissian billy dee williams chewbacca peter mayhew c3p0 anthony daniels and r2d2 kenny baker are on a rescue mission to lukes home planet of tatooine,positive
their goal to save han solo harrison ford from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt,positive
it is at jabbas home a creepylooking stone fortress guarded by hognosed beasts that most of the added special effects come into play,positive
from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabbas sand barge the effects are top notch,positive
as soon as han is freed from his cryofreeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt its back to outer space where the rebel alliance is about to face the empires newest threat a second more powerful death star that if activated could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor,positive
so while the fleet prepares for the final battle luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks,positive
there they are befriended by the ewoks the teddy bearlike native race and luke fearing that his presence is endangering the group turns himself over to vader,positive
return of the jedi has some interesting elements,positive
the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and wellacted,positive
from a technical pointofview the space battles are amazing easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films,positive
not only are there many many more ships but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved,positive
on one level return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects,positive
in the special edition even more ships are added making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch,positive
the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films,positive
by now or then 1983 mark hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher have all matured in their onscreen personas,positive
the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific,positive
as in empire billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for,positive
newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy cunning and evil creature although hes not as imposing as vader was in star wars,positive
although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment,positive
with the spectacular new special effects the adorable ewoks the sinister jabba the hutt the evil emperor the same old millenium falcon darth vaders incredible betrayal the destruction of the new death star and the always lovable yoda return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang,positive
congratulations to george lucas whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come,positive
so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton but they just dont get the good grades,positive
so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools,positive
legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide the remaining roommates will get an automatic 4 0,positive
chris michael vartan and tim matthew lillard are two guys who really want the 4 0 to get into harvard,positive
how far will they go to get their 4 0,positive
chris and tim are also roommates with rand played by randall batinkoff,positive
the two scheme to murder rand make it look like a suicide so they can supposedly get their 4 0,positive
they have heard this rumor many places and they are willing to take the chance to find out,positive
rand is a very very mean person,positive
he treats his girlfriend natalie played by tamara craig thomas like she doesnt matter at all,positive
she is very afraid of him and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant,positive
she does tell him and he becomes enraged,positive
that night would be the last night of rands life,positive
tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison making him think that it is beer,positive
rand drinks down the poison and then dies,positive
now tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself,positive
it does not take long until the suicide note is found but the body isnt found,positive
the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information,positive
feeling extreme guilt chris is having a very hard time especially with his girlfriend emma played by keri russell,positive
she wants to know more but he will not even speak with her,positive
will he give in,positive
will tim turn chris in,positive
will chris turn tim in,positive
will they turn themselves in,positive
all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film,positive
the events in the curve are very surprising original and fun,positive
the plot sounds much like dead man on campus but that is not the deal with this film,positive
this film is a very serious one with not many laughs,positive
there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films,positive
the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying,positive
it is a terrific suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen,positive
hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride,positive
the sound really stood out in the film,positive
it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film,positive
the way the movie is filmed is also great,positive
all of the technical aspects as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done,positive
the performances in the curve are very good,positive
matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role just like in 1996s scream,positive
a he is very strange in this film as well,positive
i like him in this sort of role rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and shes all that,positive
michael vartan is fantastic as chris who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the 4 0,positive
michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed where he costarred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student,positive
keri russell also gives a great performance,positive
she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film,positive
tamara craig thomas is also realistic especially coping with the death of her boyfriend,positive
some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case,positive
the bottom line i might just have to curve that a into an a,positive
note the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998,positive
it was decided the film would not be released widely,positive
it is now available at blockbuster video only and for rent only,positive
see you at the video store,positive
this has been an extraordinary year for australian films,positive
shine has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards picking up best film best actor best director etc to that we can add the gritty life the anguish courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hivpositive section of a jail and love and other catastrophes a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus,positive
i cant recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia,positive
shine was one bookend,positive
stand by for the other one dead heart,positive
from the opening credits the theme of division is established,positive
the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names,positive
bryan brown,positive
in a desert settlement hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby,positive
the local police officer has the task of enforcing white mans justice to the aboriginals,positive
these are people with a proud 40 000 year heritage behind them,positive
naturally this includes their own system of justice key to which is payback,positive
an eye for an eye,positive
revenge,positive
usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipients thigh,positive
brown as the officer manages quite well to keep the balance,positive
he admits that he has to bend the rules a bit including actively encouraging at least one brutal payback,positive
be warned that this scene near the start is not for the squeamish,positive
the local priest an aboriginal but in the white fellas church has a foot on either side of the line,positive
he is figuratively and literally in both camps,positive
ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle,positive
he is part churchman and part politician,positive
however the tension like the heat flies and dust is always there,positive
whilst her husband the local teacher is in church white lady kate milliken and her aborginal friend tony pedersen have gone off into the hills,positive
he takes her to a sacred site even today strictly menonly,positive
she appears to not know this,positive
tony tells her that this is a special place an initiation place,positive
he then makes love to her surrounded by ancient rock art,positive
the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and its payback time,positive
the fuse is lit and the brittle interracial peace is shattered,positive
everyone is affected in the fall out,positive
to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film,positive
suffice to say its a rewarding experience,positive
bryan brown acting and coproducing is the pivotal character,positive
his officer is real human and therefore flawed,positive
brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man then suddenly feel angry about him,positive
it wasnt long ago that i visited central australia ayers rock uluru and alice springs for the first time,positive
the widescreen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures its vicious beauty but never deteriorates into a moving slide show in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground,positive
the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film from the western to the birdcage,positive
at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglosaxon invaders jedda the chant of jimmie blacksmith and the last wave,positive
in a year when the race debate has reared up in australia it is nourishing to see such an intelligent nonjudgemental film as dead heart,positive
the aboriginal priest best sums this up,positive
he is asked to say if he is a black fella or white fella,positive
no it is not a bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly,positive
event horizon is not your runofthemill scifi film im sure many who have watched this will agree with me,positive
it is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner,positive
the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical buildup that makes it wonderfully horrifying,positive
the story brings us to the year 2050 where space travel have since enormously progressed,positive
the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a mans lifetime,positive
the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune,positive
a search and rescue team led by miller fishburne is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon,positive
the designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship,positive
event horizon is a scifi horror film much truer to the word than say alien would ever be,positive
while in alien the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying,positive
the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud enough,positive
i cant stand this anymore,positive
there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime,positive
the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average by most commercial standards,positive
even so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film thanks to its wellpaced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences which incidentally has been quite generously removed by our censorship board 20,positive
director paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term horror,positive
this picture did not do very well in the us boxoffice most probably for the dreadfactor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this,positive
although on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for massentertainment many thrills spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus,positive
however the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing,positive
my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the experience of event horizon,positive
i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us,positive
be forewarned this film is not for the fainthearted nor for pure entertainment,positive
be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film,positive
event horizon is highly recommended8585but at your own risk,positive
it has been a long time since goodhorror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one,positive
jaws is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen,positive
the movie opens with blackness and only distant alienlike underwater sounds,positive
then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score,positive
dahdum,positive
from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly,positive
right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip,positive
perhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie,positive
he works it like a theatrical production with a first act and a second act,positive
unlike so many modern filmmakers he has a great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act,positive
until then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music,positive
hes building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the sharks arrival is truly terrifying,positive
he doesnt let us get bored with the imagery,positive
the first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider a new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years,positive
the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money,positive
brody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss a young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute,positive
hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark its a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying,positive
when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark,positive
the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it,positive
jaws is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror,positive
it is like ten movies all rolled into one and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by star wars,positive
even today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks psycho and it never seems to age,positive
although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill,positive
the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects,positive
scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman,positive
nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark,positive
scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town,positive
its your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him,positive
dreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti 1973 and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz 1974 gives a surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers,positive
however most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards,positive
bordering of parody shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism,positive
hes slightly deranged and shaws performance is almost a caricature,positive
however there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars,positive
quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u s s,positive
indianapolis a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese,positive
his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen,positive
shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film,positive
of course we cant leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature,positive
a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are a threat,positive
every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark a bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into,positive
the shark in jaws was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles,positive
many have forgotten but jaws was a sort of precursor to waterworld 1995 a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb,positive
but as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scarethrillers ever to come out of hollywood,positive
this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989,positive
whether it was the meddling of studio executives or the work of james cameron himself the original cut of this underwater scifi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed,positive
the main problem was fairly simple the films climax was unworthy of its buildup,positive
someone at 20th century fox and no doubt cameron himself must have agreed because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss special edition,positive
now available on video it seems timely to reevaluate what in its newly revamped state is now a nearmasterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 odyssey two alien and close encounters of third kind,positive
the plot is thus,positive
we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hardnosed lindsay mastrantonio and captained by her soontobedivorced husband bud ed harris,positive
the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u s nuclear submarine,positive
requiring a dive partway down a three mile deep trench three navy divers arrive to command the operation led by the edgy lieutenant coffey biehn,positive
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever theyre dealing with as she memorably puts it arent speaking russian,positive
meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and even worse a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u s navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions,positive
this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig with the triggerhappy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goingson around them,positive
the human drama is often riveting with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in camerons aliens,positive
the stunts hardware special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding,positive
and so they should be camerons technical credentials are well established,positive
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands 1 the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and exhubby bud 2 the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis befall them and 3 the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss,positive
the abyss special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects,positive
one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay a relationship at times touching at others incredibly intense and volatile,positive
the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the films end when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war,positive
with the inclusion of these startling scenes the storys climax is now given real weight,positive
why on earth were they left out of the original,positive
this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible,positive
so then we have 25 minutes of additional footage thats turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent,positive
i say quite because some flaws do remain,positive
the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz some new some old that may well have you reaching for the barf bag,positive
nonetheless the abyss special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james camerons greatest achievements alongside aliens and terminator 2 see it and be moved gripped and spellbound,positive
today war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan,positive
steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production,positive
the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war,positive
please keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality,positive
tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier private ryan matt damon who lost three brothers in the war,positive
spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes,positive
private ryan is not for everyone but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made,positive
the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women,positive
we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice their lives so that we may live in freedom today,positive
for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget,positive
the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 as another well deserved oscar with be in toms posession,positive
director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days terry gilliam comes to mind as another one,positive
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something,positive
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story,positive
so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential the film almost automatically deserves a good review,positive
and when they add a fascinating story to it you have nearly perfect entertainment,positive
finchers the game is no exception to this,positive
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time,positive
fincher hasnt made a film since seven his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever,positive
so it is about time he made another film,positive
and what a ride it is,positive
the game isnt quite as powerful as seven but in some ways it is better,positive
overall the game could have used a little more clarity or a little more uncertainty,positive
it walks a line of insanity and reality but it never goes either way until the very end,positive
the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight,positive
unfortunately unlike the usual suspects we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening whether it be true or false,positive
however this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent,positive
the game is told completely from its main characters point of view,positive
nicholas van orton michael douglas is a highstrung and isolated businessman,positive
he lives alone in his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and is celebrating his 48th birthday the same age at which his father committed suicide at in the same mansion,positive
for his 48th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel of the family gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs consumer recreation services,positive
it will make your life fun again his brother promises,positive
as skeptical as nicholas is he is somewhat intrigued and annoyed by the lack of informationsomething this businessman hates,positive
seeing a billboard in an office he decides to visit the mysterious company,positive
jim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas and guides him through the signup process which consists of psychtests physicals emotional responses and other mind games,positive
each game is suited to each persons emotional and psychological needs explains feingold,positive
one day nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests,positive
even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company,positive
what he doesnt realize is that the game has already begun,positive
the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas way,positive
how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive,positive
the detail involved in finchers shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them,positive
with seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something,positive
he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to,positive
compared to seven though the game is light and comical,positive
because of this films sense of humor and selfawareness nothing can be taken quite seriously,positive
so dont try to make much sense of what goes on in the game because it doesnt want you to,positive
what does make sense is the final revelationwhen everything becomes apparent and clear,positive
if taken as it is the games ending makes complete sense,positive
but if you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility,positive
perhaps that is the reason i docked the film,positive
while trying to remain realistic and plausible the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen,positive
we dont really care if douglas character lives or not because it isnt believable,positive
the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller,positive
michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas,positive
douglas has played lonely businessmen before but here he adds another level to his performance,positive
his character who is normally levelheaded and relies on facts is forced to trust nobody,positive
can he believe the waitress he bumped into,positive
what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place,positive
douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well and gives one of his best performances even better than his falling down persona,positive
the supporting cast is essential in this film and casting was critical,positive
sean penn is always good and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother,positive
deborah kara unger from crash is the waitress he bumps into and her performance is extremely good,positive
in fact she almost steals the film from douglas,positive
james rebhorn portrays his character very well and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament,positive
another good performance comes from armin muellerstahl from shine as the book editor,positive
but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game he not only commands this cast but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life,positive
the game is rated r for language violence some gore and some nudity and drugs,positive
what is essential for this film to work is the writing,positive
john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue and some very funny moments,positive
this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did,positive
however the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot,positive
and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this years best films,positive
pulp fiction quentin tarantinos anxiously awaited and superb followup to reservoir dogs is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about loved and hated films of alltime,positive
in all fairness it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it,positive
as if reservoir dogs wasnt perfect tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction a fastpaced hard talking roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way,positive
every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor,positive
to begin with the two hit men vincent vega john travolta and jules winnfield samuel l jackson,positive
these two characters work together perfectly and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect,positive
travolta in fact is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role,positive
if these two characters were not enough theres the struggling boxer butch coolidge bruce willis the two smalltime criminals pumpkin tim roth and honey bunny amanda plummer the big man in charge marsellus wallace ving rhames and his attractive young wife mia uma thurman and the problem solver himself the wolf harvey keitel,positive
these are just the major characters,positive
smaller roles but equally terrific are handed to jimmie quentin tarantino a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business lance eric stoltz the farout drug dealer as well as maynard duane whitaker and zed peter greene two hillbillies who are the men behind no pun intended for those of you who have seen this a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film,positive
the film interweaves three stories that at first seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other,positive
the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and holdups,positive
the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop unknowing of what lies ahead,positive
after this the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle,positive
utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants,positive
the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss marsellus wallace,positive
after basically toying with the men especially the unfortunate brett frank whaley vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase,positive
this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a 357,positive
hand cannon shooting at the two gangsters,positive
he somehow completely misses them leading jules to cite divine intervention,positive
this is also the basis for more of the nowfamous tarantino dialogue,positive
the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades,positive
butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight but when he does not marsellus vows to find him wherever he is and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune,positive
vincent meanwhile has the honor of taking marsellus wife mia out on a date while the big man is out of town,positive
vincent obviously is rather nervous about this especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage,positive
after their date which seems to rather smoothly things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincents highpriced heroin dubbed a monster by lance,positive
each story continually progresses and new and amazing events occur,positive
eventually the stories all meet each other in the end with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant which happens to contain both vincent and jules,positive
pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade and possibly of alltime,positive
along with its superb dialogue action writing directing and acting this film will not only latch onto you but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you,positive
and with most fans of this movie this is proved to be a rather easy task although at times the graphic images violence and language may seem a bit overpowering,positive
surely quentin tarantinos fame was greatly escalated by this film and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon,positive
making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece,positive
when it comes to living up to expectations a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure,positive
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the originals greatness is very rare indeed,positive
and whereas babe pig in the city misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe it is a worthy companion piece,positive
more than that it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right,positive
babe pig in the city warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like the godfather part ii and the empire strikes back as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced,positive
babe pig in the city picks up precisely where babe left off,positive
having won the sheep herding competition farmer hoggett james cromwell and his pig are elevated to fame status,positive
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city,positive
in doing so the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original,positive
babe pig in the city flourishes where so many sequels fail,positive
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film,positive
not babe pig in the city,positive
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first,positive
also by not being content to utilize most of the old characters this film gives us many new ones to enjoy,positive
in essence it doesnt attempt to copy itself,positive
instead it strives to achieve an originality of its own,positive
and it succeeds,positive
thats not to say the familiar is absent,positive
babe pig in the city retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film,positive
along with babe himself ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride as does mrs hoggett one of this decades best and most underappreciated comic characterizations hilariously performed by magda szubanski,positive
the three singing mice also make the journey chiming in with their cute highpitched vocals,positive
the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice,positive
from there we are guided once again by roscoe lee brownes soothingly deep narrative,positive
composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these,positive
but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting,positive
while staying at the flealands hotel babe encounters a veritable arkfull of new animals,positive
monkeys kittens and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new urbanites that babe befriends as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter,positive
each character is distinctly unique some of which are imbued with personal humanlike struggles that are endearing and touching,positive
and while this world focuses largely on these animals we are introduced to two new human characters as well,positive
mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel an animalloving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors,positive
steins landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature,positive
we also meet fugly floom an old softspoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions,positive
not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was,positive
so as not to ruin this wellkept secret i wont reveal the actors identity here,positive
it was a treat indeed to see one of cinemas legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance,positive
the greatest triumph of babe pig in the city is the art direction,positive
simply putit bleeds creativity taking the look of the original film to a whole new level,positive
restricted primarily to a farm the first time around this second installment creates an entire city dazzling us with unique fablelike architecture,positive
but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our worlds architectural landmarks,positive
designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty the sydney opera house the brooklyn bridge the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities as seen in the film photo and preproduction drawing to your right,positive
added to that many of this citys streets are the twin siblings of venices gondolatrekked rivers,positive
the metropolis that has sprung from fords vision is a wondrous sight to behold,positive
it is a world that you want to walk around in,positive
norma moriceaus costume designs belong in this world vibrant in color and style equal to that of the fords landscape,positive
most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly flooms clown outfit,positive
andrew lesnies photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the films multiple emotional tones,positive
much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of babe pig in the city,positive
reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg13 rating,positive
these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating,positive
but even so to be anything harsher than the original s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms,positive
by deleting a minimal number of shots babe pig in the city was eventually given the coveted g rating,positive
although appeased many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself,positive
well to coin a phrase the reports of babe pig in the city s death at the hands of a dark scary felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated,positive
granted it has its moments of pseudomorbidity but allinall babe pig in the city is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be,positive
whatever dark moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller the mad max trilogy the witches of eastwick lorenzos oil,positive
having served as a producer and cowriter on the first film miller moves into the directors chair for this one putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise,positive
the story of babe pig in the city is an enchanting yarn but one that doesnt achieve the emotional or character depth of the original,positive
missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity an individuals worth challenging conformity and ones purpose in life,positive
babe dealt with this weighty subject matter creating a timeless fable,positive
babe pig in the city should not have rehashed these themes but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones,positive
this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife class differences sacrificial courage and so on,positive
but this films goals arent as lofty as the firsts instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting sometimes intense fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive,positive
babe pig in the city also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe,positive
hoggetts love for babe which grew ever so gently is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality,positive
best exemplified in hoggetts dance for babe this moving relationship was truly unique,positive
it is something that i wish would have been present again and could have through fugly floom but was not,positive
please understand these are not negative criticisms per se but simply statements of what i see as the differences between babe pig in the city being a very good film and the original being a great one,positive
but having said that these observations are minor critiques at best,positive
as an overall piece babe pig in the city is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end,positive
sure it isnt a great film but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness,positive
it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor exciting in its adventurous exploits funny with its dry wit and cute voices and breathtaking in its presentation,positive
babe pig in the city may not be moviemaking at its absolute best but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema,positive
as a result if you choose to let this film pass you by you will be missing of the years best cinematic treats,positive
i was pleasantly surprised by this film,positive
with a budget topping 200 million i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth centurys greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see,positive
how much could you dress up the sets,positive
how many models and computer effects could you use,positive
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks,positive
oh if ive just given away part of the plot for you go back to school,positive
after having viewed titanic however i found it to be a wellpaced welldesigned and overall wellmade movie,positive
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best ive seen,positive
titanic tells its story in two time periods,positive
it starts out in the present when ocean explorer brock lovett bill paxton and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship,positive
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace which is broadcast on the news,positive
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas,positive
there she tells her story to lovett and his team,positive
in 1912 rose dewitt bukater kate winslett a young lady belonging to societys upper class boards the titanic for the ships first atlantic crossing from southampton england to new york,positive
she is engaged to cal hockley billy zane an heir to old money and a snob in every sense of the word,positive
on board rose feels the stifling trappings of highsocietys expectations and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanics stern but is saved from her selfproclaimed fate by jack dawson leonardo dicaprio a passenger in thirdclass steerage as its referred to who talks her out of jumping,positive
although for rose the attraction is not immediate a love affair soon develops between the two which endangers roses social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal,positive
the story sounds very simple and perhaps even unexciting but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron a good movie comes through,positive
dicaprio is marvelous as the young but worldlywise jack playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors,positive
his is a character that is immediately likable as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations,positive
girls are going to swoon over him,positive
winslet also proves herself a good actress delivering her lines convincingly and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable,positive
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her characters upbringing,positive
simply by judgment of her gait i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an uppercrust debutante,positive
rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess she sometimes looks positively clumsy and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting,positive
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him,positive
his features are such that even when he smiles theres something mistrustful about him and when he scowls he is evil incarnate,positive
hes something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher but a cheaper model,positive
like dicaprio and winslet zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well,positive
backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy cals personal assistant or man as they said at the turn of the century,positive
no matter who else is in the cast you can always count on a good performance by warner who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match,positive
additionally there are a number of smaller fictional and nonfictional roles thrown in for color such as kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown danny nucci as jacks friend fabrizio de rossi eric braeden as john jacob astor and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie,positive
nice to see dr bombay getting work,positive
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die,positive
this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ships crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the firstclass passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else,positive
in this way titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures,positive
you dont just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop but a very real account of class struggle as well,positive
as i mentioned before the budget for this film was tremendous and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects,positive
the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic,positive
with regard to the exteriors i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale,positive
cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank but only had room for 90 and therefore had to computergenerate the remaining 40 feet,positive
couldve fooled me and everyone else in the theater as the splicing is seamless,positive
also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning,positive
we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship how the flooding occurred the way the ship sank and why it did so in that manner,positive
these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion,positive
in all james camerons titanic is a good blend of love story history and action,positive
the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewers attention is held alternately by those three main elements from the movies intriguing beginning to its satisfactory ending,positive
in box office receipts titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship,positive
originally titled dont lose your head this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions,positive
two english fops the powdered bewigged beribboned sir rodney ffing sidney james and his counterpart lord darcy pew jim dale decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine,positive
due to a series of machinations and disguises they are largely successful,positive
ffing becomes known as the black fingernail because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up one with a black fingernail,positive
after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit charles hawtrey citizen robespierre peter gilmore orders the head of the secret police citizen the big cheese camembert kenneth williams and citizen bidet peter butterworth to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him,positive
in fact darcy and ffing are their coachmen,positive
once at calais the fingernail meets jacqueline dany robin and they fall in love instantly,positive
he tells her his identity and gives her his locket,positive
when camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail,positive
jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert his love desiree dubarry joan sims and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail,positive
they pretend to be of noble stock calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante with bidet their assistant and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing,positive
desiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck but she ends up falling in love with him,positive
ffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline camembert has her moved to the chateau neuve and a climactic swordfight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film,positive
a more complex story than most carry ons this film enjoys good production values sets costumes and an onform cast,positive
sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camemberts thickwitted crony,positive
other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit,positive
although it suffers from a disasterously overlong sword fight at the end of the film it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars its slick and professional production and its betterthanusual script,positive
definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch,positive
not since oliver stones natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary and not since david cronenberg has a socalled mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility,positive
while finchers films have never suffered from a lack of shock value his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples fight club marks the distillation of his pitchblack comedic sensibility see 1997s the game into something like a definitive statement,positive
jack norton acting as both narrator and protagonist is your typical cubicle clone whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia,positive
on the offhand advice of a doctor he sits in on grouptherapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer,positive
here he meets bob marvin lee aday aka meat loaf a canceremasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia,positive
strangely the release he finds while sobbing on bobs breasts allows him to sleep at night at least until a fellow grouptherapy tourist named marla singer carter comes along to ruin things for him forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity,positive
later he meets tyler durden pitt a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life,positive
one night after his ikea furnished condo explodes dont ask youll just have to see the movie awright he is goaded by tyler into a fight and damned if it doesnt feel good,positive
it is pure raw existence a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison,positive
he moves into tylers squalid abandoned mansion and they form the titular organization an underground therapy group where men bond with bareknuckle savagery and very few rules the first two of which are dont talk about fight club,positive
armed with charisma and an attractive anticorporate philosophy tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of whitecollar slaves and deadend mcemployees,positive
resentment creeps into jacks heart made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla,positive
funded by a frivolous lawsuit tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem,positive
their initially juvenile pranks like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads quickly evolve into something more like sedition and jack fears that things have gone sour,positive
it is after this point when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist,positive
it is so contrived and so conventional compared to what precedes it that everything which follows including the ending becomes far less interesting,positive
its a major though not fatal flaw and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher it feels like a copout,positive
fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people,positive
in the early going it has a downright dangerous feel it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it,positive
ill be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs dont spring up here and there and ill be even more amazed if fincher isnt vilified for it by the same humorless witchhunters that are currently after oliver stone,positive
they neednt bother because fight club is less a message movie than finchers elaborate attempt at a joke,positive
tyler durden for all his dionysian allure is really nothing more than the logical and far less hypocritical extrapolation of all those selfhelp gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their mefirst gospel of selfactualization,positive
in this context the joke works but like the latest columbine joke some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh and others wont,positive
hopefully though their silly moral outrage wont spoil the joke for the rest of us,positive
probably the most popular and praised film of all time turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism,positive
everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time,positive
and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron combining visual and sound effects he recreates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere,positive
i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes,positive
while their cabin is slowly filling up with water a mother is telling her children a fairytail and,positive
they lived happily ever after,positive
and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air,positive
however the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues,positive
in the present day the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett bill paxton a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond lost during the sinking,positive
somewhere inside the ship lovetts crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead,positive
here in the shape of a nude young lady is a window into the distant age of 1912,positive
lovett is extremely surprised when he gets a phone call from rose dawson claiming that she is a model,positive
she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years,positive
as the memories come flooding back she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer kate winslet the fianc e of wealthy cal hockley billy zane and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater frances fisher,positive
on board there are rich and poor everyone trust in the ships designer jonathan hyde and her master captain e j,positive
smith bernard hill,positive
on board the ship rose unhappy and restless meets jack leonardo dicaprio a young american artist poor brave and attractive,positive
a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes but also face the greatest power on earth death,positive
cameron could as well have called his picture the never ending love or love at first sight as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple and not on the disaster itself,positive
the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soapopera,positive
the director doesnt even try to overcome his empty script,positive
because of its primitive and predictable plot titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking,positive
russel carpenters rich majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly awardworthy,positive
everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch,positive
but it doesnt help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them,positive
the actors are not to blame because their characters are more like caricatures in other words fake,positive
jack is a man with many talents he is a talented artist handsome brave honest strong funny you,positive
name it,positive
he doesnt have any dark side he doesnt make any mistakes that for a second would make him human,positive
jack is perfect but he is poor,positive
on the other hand we have cal,positive
he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wifetobe,positive
he lacks everything jack possesses but he is rich,positive
this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture,positive
cameron knows precisely what we want to see,positive
his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience attractive actors a tragic love story beautiful visuals including expensive special effects a dose of social criticism a fascinating historical event we love true stories and last but not least an incredible media support which proclaimed an average picture the greatest film of all time,positive
on the outside titanic looks perfect but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals is emptiness nothing to think about,positive
the main weakness of this film which ironically became its success is simplicity,positive
cameron enables our basic and if you wish primitive emotions love hate fear and helplessness,positive
everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable a sinking ship,positive
titanic is a typical hollywood production totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot,positive
its a good picture but absolutely not a masterpiece,positive
its among hundreds and thousands good films released every year not better or worse than the average american film,positive
october sky is a rare oddity in cinema a selfproclaimed uplifting film that is actually uplifting,positive
based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam rocket boys october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream,positive
its 1957 and for the boys of coalwood west virginia theres not much hope of a rosy future,positive
coalwood is a coal mining town and except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship most of coalwoods boys are destined to work in the mine,positive
but in october 1957 an event happens that sparks one boy to dream,positive
the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam jake gyllenhaal to dream a future of rocketry and space travel,positive
of course homers parents chris cooper and natalie canderday arent quite sure what to make of their sons unusual interests,positive
homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley laura dern a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair,positive
and so with stars in his eyes and thoughts of scholarships in his head homer enlists the help of three other boys william lee scott chad lindberg and chris owen and begins to build a rocket,positive
but do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny,positive
there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky,positive
nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched,positive
however miraculously october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls making the exact right moves at the exact right times,positive
a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness,positive
jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film,positive
from the outset of the film he is immediately likable and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience,positive
unfortunately while october sky focuses on homer the other three kids get the short end of the stick,positive
they remain little more than placeholders reading insert friend here,positive
of the adults in the film chris cooper is the most fully realized character,positive
the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his childs dreams but instead shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town but is too stubborn to realize what that is,positive
director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge,positive
however there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far,positive
scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial,positive
however these lapses are minimal and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course,positive
the problem with many socalled uplifting films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat,positive
october sky never resorts to that level and yet manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits,positive
warning anyone offended by blatant leering machismo had better avoid this film,positive
or lots of blood guts men against men and manoetmano stuff,positive
in other words its a walter hill film,positive
with a john milius script,positive
i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between armwrestling matches,positive
these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb,positive
and we got tough guys galore here drugrunning banditos by the dozens all dirty and sweaty and pretty illtempered overall a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to coverup supposedly any connection between the government and the drug runners and lots of shitkicking texas dirt farmers whod as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you,positive
in particular we got nick nolte as one hardass texas ranger powers boothe as the drug kingpin michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army and rip torn as the local sheriff,positive
torn is the sympathetic figure of the group he smiles before shooting anyone,positive
as to women,positive
well ive never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film and at this rate i doubt i ever will,positive
women exist here to look good comfort the man and get argued over,positive
gosh,positive
just like the old days,positive
frankly this is a pretty good movie if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff,positive
the cinematography is excellent the cast of characters is broad and has texture the script is quite good and the film lets you keep up with whats happening yourself without spelling it out to you,positive
i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up,positive
finally theres lots of sam peckinpah slowmotion shootups,positive
being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it shall we dance wont be seen by that many people,positive
and thats a shame this is a funny enchanting and goofy movie full of laughs surprises and wonderful dance sequences,positive
the surprising thing about shall we dance is the universal appeal of the story,positive
a us version is in the works and its no wonder its not really all that culture specific,positive
although there is a narrated setup that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isnt at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film,positive
the only important unexplained japanesespecific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly 10 when you see the film and you should see this film youll know why,positive
a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life a house a child and good marriage still doesnt translate into a fulfilled life,positive
after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work sugiyana koji yakusho decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself,positive
after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai tamiyo kusakari too rich for his blood sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her,positive
we then meet the players in this gem of a movie who all have their own reasons for joining the class,positive
later on we meet aoki at the dance studio naoto takenaka a coworker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film,positive
the story laughs and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along,positive
its a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances,positive
its difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters and in the end each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater,positive
its one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore no big plot no special effects no gunplay no tragic consequences no forced examinations of the nature of love and no insights into the nature of evil,positive
just a warm funny endearing film that will charm the pants off of you,positive
when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside,positive
shall we dance will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste,positive
i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister,positive
twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with,positive
but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano,positive
volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo,positive
he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter,positive
there is one small quake then another quake,positive
then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours,positive
a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall,positive
then it,positive
starts,positive
the volcanic eruption,positive
i liked this movie but,positive
it was not as great as i hoped,positive
i was still good none the less,positive
it had excellent special effects,positive
the best view the,positive
helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos,positive
also there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting,positive
so it was good,positive
when i first heard of contact the hype was building it up as a scifi blockbuster,positive
now with that in mind coupled with the knowledge of jodie fosters involvement in the project i thought what in the world is foster doing in a scifi blockbuster,positive
as it turned out my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsyturvy,positive
robert zemeckis back from the euphoria created by his last film forrest gump once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit,positive
dont get me wrong contact is scifi but with a definite difference,positive
based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name the story delves itself in questions on science and god fact and faith,positive
allie foster is a radio astronomer,positive
she spends her time listening to the stars via ultrahuge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system,positive
her passion for longdistance communication is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a hamradio system a hobbyist radio communication device which her latefather bought for her,positive
a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her latemother through the hamradio system in which her father replied not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that now,positive
allies research is based on the seti project search for extra terrestrial intelligence in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation,positive
her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government which considers it a waste of taxpayers money and politically unviable her supervisor tom skerritt pulls the plug on seti,positive
undaunted allie managed to gather a loyal group of believers and eventually found funding from a large private corporation,positive
the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating soundwave,positive
the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers cultist the media and of course the government,positive
the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission,positive
as the world join forces to build this transport allie is desperate to be the one to go,positive
she enrols herself among a few hopefuls to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation,positive
her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the presidents spiritual advisor mcconaughey allie being an atheist a result of her belief in fact and science refuses to budge upon questioning,positive
at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the presidents spiritual advisor,positive
a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey,positive
from the very first meeting scene it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith hope and the power of the unseen,positive
the meeting of their worlds added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless,positive
many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous but by actually immersing yourself in it gives you an entirely different perspective one which is free from bias and preconceptions,positive
zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film,positive
contact works by not delving in controversy but rather touches the thinking audience urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith whether one can actually find compromise within,positive
i consider contact as one of the mustsees for this year,positive
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the xfiles,positive
first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie,positive
the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable,positive
you have to reach for a larger audience,positive
therefore the movie is quite userfriendly,positive
altough nonfans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange,positive
but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on,positive
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera,positive
in any case the answer is no,positive
i am not a fan of the xfiles i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium,positive
however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie,positive
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new,positive
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others,positive
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie,positive
warning major spoilers follow,positive
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about,positive
you have been warned,positive
the xfiles is what a summer should be,positive
exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances,positive
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank,positive
from start to finish this movie does not let go of you,positive
when i compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from and the deadly use of sound from event horizon,positive
this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes,positive
in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue,positive
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd,positive
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid,positive
you know when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt,positive
so yeah the xfiles is scary,positive
and guess what,positive
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster,positive
do not think that the xfiles is a monster movie,positive
in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total,positive
no the xfiles is definately a mulder episode of the series,positive
scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time,positive
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much,positive
no this is mulders time in the spotlight,positive
by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day,positive
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead,positive
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who,positive
cares,positive
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about,positive
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous,positive
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill,positive
the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose,positive
if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i cannot stress this enough pay attention,positive
unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects,positive
miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense,positive
also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies dont,positive
the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation,positive
there is no time to take a breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody,positive
the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves a purpose,positive
who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attacks,positive
so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies id recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose,positive
but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the xfiles is,positive
what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited,positive
cool effects,positive
its good some,positive
pulse pounding,positive
hell yes,positive
strangely enough i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have a good time,positive
it does not provide answers to the shows many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together,positive
rating four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah i never saw that one coming,positive
moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending,positive
you may wonder where this movie lost half a star,positive
well i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop,positive
its pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving,positive
ok i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start,positive
a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents,positive
with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure,positive
yuck,positive
but its not really too bad,positive
it has a lot working against it for me at least,positive
in addition to the above it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified madefortv movie but longer and with bigger stars and you have to pay to see it,positive
it does win you over though even if it is painfully predictable,positive
just think about it two single parents with their cute kids are thrown together due to a missed field trip,positive
through a day of near disasters they cont inually meet get in one anothers way cause trouble for one another and generally insult one another at every opportunity,positive
in fact they hate each other so much that we know that they are or soon will be in love,positive
the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples,positive
so this film is predictable just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable and the screwball genre is obviously hoffmans model for this film,positive
will they get fired from their yuppie jobs,positive
will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids,positive
will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her exhusband a drummer for bruce springsteen really is arent they all,positive
will they finally kiss,positive
well what do you expect,positive
but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled especially when it is done with as much humour along with a lack of sticky sentimentality as it is in this film,positive
pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show,positive
one word of caution though,positive
this film is being billed in some places as a family movie,positive
dont let that stop you,positive
however i think most kids especially boys would be pretty bored by this move,positive
after all nobody gets killed and there are no explosions,positive
all in all a good nonoffensive date movie,positive
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,positive
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,positive
pretty good bring a friend,positive
amazing potent stuff,positive
perfection,positive
see it twice,positive
niagara niagara r bob gosses niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of youngloversontheroad movies,positive
wild marcy robin tunney and calm seth henry thomas meet cute literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store,positive
a mere couple of scenes later the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants,positive
along the way true love inevitably blossoms,positive
what sets niagara niagara apart though is that marcy is afflicted with tourettes syndrome a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics,positive
tunney displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last years venice film festival,positive
to term her work a tourdeforce is not to imply that she attacks the scenery tunneys effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability which makes her depiction of marcys illnesswhich often causes her to act violentlythat much more convincing and tragic,positive
she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly offkilter chemistry,positive
their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss,positive
a detour involving a kindly widower michael parks who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt and the key character of a triggerhappy pharmacist stephen lang is highly unbelievable,positive
but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunneys bravura turn which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved,positive
opens march 20,positive
i didnt know what to expect,positive
its like something you chase for so long but then you dont know how to react when you get it,positive
i still dont know how to react,positive
michael jordan on winning his first nba championship in 1991 or,positive
my thoughts after meeting him on november 21 1997,positive
trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semidramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter,positive
the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60s then cut to the harsh reality of the present,positive
sheffield has become some sort of a semislum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steelfactories a once flourishing industry,positive
gaz carlyle spends most of his time in the workers club a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers,positive
he and his plump friend dave addy as well as their former foreman gerald wilkinson have been sitting around the club for months without any call for duty,positive
what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of childsupport money to his exwife,positive
suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son he goes on to concoct an enterprising wildidea to get the money he desperately requires,positive
dave and gerald too have problems of their own,positive
on top of his lack of employment dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as hisplump appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months leaving home for work when he was actually a longstanding member of the workers club,positive
there we have it people with real problems and a notsopractical solution for them,positive
gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag to perform a stripact at the local pub,positive
in gazs own words while looking at an add for a stripact featuring hunky beautiful men if women are willing to pay for this they sure as well will pay for realmen,positive
the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all,positive
it is a small film which delves in the harshreality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to,positive
it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of humanfactor going for it,positive
never for once was it trying to be manipulative at all the full monty was true to itself all the way,positive
while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh something lacking in many comedy films wannabes from hollywood,positive
other than carlyle who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me onscreen,positive
however the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying,positive
carlyles work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting implying real acting skill and flexibility onscreen,positive
kudos to the people involved in this film especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your justanotherstriptease,positive
already a critical and financial success for such a small film the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout,positive
while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way the full monty gives one the same satisfaction in,positive
half the time,positive
oh behave,positive
felicity shagwell is one shagadellic babe,positive
do i make your horny,positive
female fembots with breasts that require gun controlling,positive
anything that resembles bananas and two balls of icecream,positive
the nutbiting finale between mini me and austin,positive
all that body hair is a real turn on its a pity more leading men dont wear it on screen,positive
anything that vaguely resembles sausages and eggs,positive
fat bastard,positive
the love scene between felicity and fat bastard that redefines sex,positive
the wrongly implied love scene in the tent that redefines anal sex,positive
the love scene between austin and ivana humpalot that redefines chess and oral sex,positive
the love scene between dr evil and frau farbissina that redefines weird sex,positive
the love affair between austin and felicity that does not happen because his mojo goes missing,positive
the relationship between dr evil himself and mini me which redefines a solo love affair,positive
the unique relationship between dr evil and his son scott www com zip that says a lot about our relationship with our children nowadays,positive
weanies johnny richard dick etc,positive
this movie is every bit as silly and crazy as the first,positive
there are moments that will make your sick which are probably best forgotten but overall mike myers has redefined what it means to be an international spy and leading man,positive
synopsis in this cultural exploration a chinese american computer engineer named fang peter wang decides to take a monthlong vacation to visit his sister mrs chao shen guanglan her husband mr chao hy xiaoguang and their teenage daughter lili li qinqin in beijing after 30 years of separation,positive
fang brings his asian american wife grace sharon iwai and his collegeaged son paul kelvin han yee along both of whom dont speak chinese,positive
the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters,positive
opinion sometimes a film is plot driven,positive
sometimes its a character sketch,positive
a great wall 1986 can be called a culture sketch as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family,positive
fangs family is thoroughly americanized,positive
fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss,positive
his wife cant cook chinese,positive
his son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl,positive
meanwhile fangs beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the work unit,positive
her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity homosexuals running the streets and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life,positive
the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other,positive
there is no ultimate answer or final comprehensive understanding after the monthlong vacation,positive
the film is neither here nor there its a neutral meandering gentle portrait of life on both sides,positive
contact is a film that tries to do several different things,positive
it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster and the religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey,positive
the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals,positive
the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable albeit less immediately engaging than say the coldblooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tvs the xfiles,positive
the aliens in contact seem to be like usthey are more curious than anything else,positive
they know we exist they want us to know that they exist and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person,positive
the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly and between the characters ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey,positive
most of the film however takes place on earth where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens,positive
scientists are enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leaders are wary and government officials are caught somewhere in between,positive
the debate is fueled largely by dr arroways atheism she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankinds representative to another species,positive
the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches science and faith could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed,positive
still the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society,positive
the two sides are represented primarily by arroway and by farright fundamentalists but in reality probably 80 of americans are neither atheists nor farright fundamentalists,positive
palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a lessthanideal spokesman for any ideology,positive
then again the film does concentrate mostly on public debate which does after all tend to be dominated by extremists rather than on dinnertable or collegedormitory discussions,positive
contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues then but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself,positive
the films one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss,positive
for one thing it resorts to the tired movie clich that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction,positive
the romance rarely if ever sheds any light on the characters although it occasionally tries and fails josss explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement i guess you could say im a man of the cloth but without the cloth for example is more like a punchline to a joke than character development,positive
instead the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments,positive
granted this is a plot and ideadriven film and the characters are secondary but this just seemed like laziness on the writers part more than anything else,positive
the successes of contact however far outweigh its failures,positive
even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether which it didnt the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film,positive
contact doesnt quite cover all the bases but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a twohour film and its rejection of bigbudget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable,positive
and i would not be surprised if ten years from now contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction,positive
capsule a rock and roll fable indeed,positive
like a hubert selby jr novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen and a ton of fun,positive
streets of fire bills itself as a rock and roll fable and the description is perfect,positive
this is a stylish greatlooking and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby jr novel with a damon runyan rewrite irected by bruce springsteen,positive
noir is one of the few truly american movie genres aside from the hollywood musical and the western,positive
this is postwwii brooklyn noir for lack of a better label with a generous injection of rock n roll and an allaround confrontational attitude,positive
it all works,positive
the plot is simplicity itself rocker ellen aim diane lane is kidnapped by a vicious street gang led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven willem dafoe very nasty,positive
her old soldier flame played by michael pare comes back into town to save her but doesnt count on a whole bunch of things going askew,positive
thats about the entire plot save for the spats with ellens manager a hilarious rick moranis an encounter with a doowop group that winds up becoming ellens supporting act and a whole gang of other fun little touches,positive
but in movies like this when is the plot important,positive
the movie is all style all visuals and attitudes quotable lines and posturing and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing,positive
no surprise that it was directed by walter hill 48 hrs who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly and has put together a movie thats a mixture of times and sensibilities but perfectly unified in tone,positive
when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw and passes out every 2 63 minutes on cue,positive
streets of fire isnt the greatest movie ever made but it occupies a totally unique little niche and enjoys the position it has,positive
anyone with a weakness for doowop neon motorcycles rainy streets the el studebakers gang pictures lonely heroes and a greatlooking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up,positive
i did,positive
film adaptation of hunter s thompsons infamous semiautobiographical hallucinogenfueled book of the same title,positive
director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys 810 and brazil 710 fame took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox sid and nancy 7 510,positive
apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie according to gilliam,positive
plot writer thompson depp heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr gonzo del toro to cover a motorcycle race,positive
during their trip they systematically consume two bags of grass seventyfive pellets of mescaline five sheets of high powered blotter acid a salt shaker halffull of cocaine a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers downers screamers laughers a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of beer a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls,positive
the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use,positive
critique i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewers own mind whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess,positive
if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels,positive
if on the other hand you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this druginduced pictures entire ride 5 510 for all those sober dogs,positive
note i have not read thompsons book,positive
having said that joblo did engage in an alcoholbased consumatory session before and during the viewing of this film so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level,positive
this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour rather than substance or plot,positive
it moves admirably from one scene to the next without much basis of their being while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine,positive
it was 1971 and the times were apparently a changing in the states,positive
johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop,positive
during the filming depp apparently become fast friends with reallife writer thompson and was known to wander off the set from time to time for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole,positive
i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much but then again this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything so who am i to talk,positive
the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr gonzo,positive
i couldnt believe that this fat samoan lawyer was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects 7 510,positive
word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible,positive
plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin christina ricci tobey maguire and cameron diaz along with a bunch of others,positive
other than that the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic the style was not as wild as i thought it would be and the ending was certainly not much of a barnburner but then again who really noticed,positive
this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head johnny depp looking goofy and being bald and the cornucopia of drugravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy rebellion and the lost american dream,positive
and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie i suggest you move further down the aisle buy yourself a ticket to godzilla 610 and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind,positive
little known facts depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine,positive
bill murray also portrayed a thompsonbased character in the film where the buffalo roam,positive
johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers speed 7 510 and legends of the fall 7 510 for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon 6 510 and whats eating gilbert grape,positive
710,positive
in 1988 depp told rolling stone magazine that hed tried every drug by the age of 14,positive
johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album be here now,positive
johnny was born in kentucky is a highschool dropout has nicknamed himself mr stench has been engaged to four women until now including actress winona ryder whose winona forever tattoo had to be altered to wino forever after their breakup currently plays guitar in a band called p and owns the viper room nightclub in l a,positive
i dont know what movie the critics saw but it wasnt this one,positive
the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring,positive
in my personal opinion they couldnt be more wrong,positive
if you were expecting airplane like,positive
laughs and agatha christieintense mystery then yes this movie would be a disappointment,positive
however if youre just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time this is one to see,positive
honest it is,positive
this story is about a 4th network wbn taking to americas airwaves in 1939,positive
penny henderson mary stuart masterson the station owners secretary must deal with her overbearing boss an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moments notice partly due to the fact that they havent been paid in weeks,positive
among the mayhem she must also deal with her soontobe exhusband roger brian benben who desperately wants her back,positive
unfortunately her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation,positive
while trying to woo penny back roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn,positive
mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny im trying to be unbiased so i wont tell you how amazing she looked although brian benben gets most of the screen time,positive
along with the two leads are several recognizable faces including corbin bernsen l a,positive
law michael mckean laverne shirley and bobcat goldthwait,positive
the special effects are amazing and fooled me which some may argue isnt very difficult to do in many scenes,positive
although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie,positive
overall i gave it or an depending on what system you use,positive
some comments collected from friends,positive
america has finally gotten what its needed for years a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma,positive
regretfully its only a movie,positive
president james marshall harrison ford is fed up with terrorist activities,positive
teaming up with the russian government he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek a reactionary general ready to reunite the soviet union under his fascist reign,positive
during a celebration dinner marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists,positive
its your turn to be afraid he declares,positive
returning home on air force one he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally,positive
ultranationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov gary oldman hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released,positive
marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule which clinton says doesnt exist in real life but refuses preferring to stay and fight,positive
director wolfgang peterson das boot in the line of fire outbreak takes the overused die hard theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with holdyourbreath intensity,positive
if you can take your eyes off the screen steal a look at the audience,positive
everyone is totally engrossed,positive
the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it,positive
oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder he does it so well,positive
when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead you know that hes over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become,positive
you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time,positive
when korshonov executes passengers there is a frightening reality to it,positive
the guns in this film are deadly weapons not cartoons,positive
harrison ford has done one role for several years,positive
his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here,positive
marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job,positive
realistically hes a man afraid but not afraid to act,positive
ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero,positive
indiana jones in the oval office,positive
he and oldmans archetypes match up perfectly,positive
the other roles also go to accomplished actors,positive
glenn close as the determined but unsure vicepresident is the picture of an executive forced into a position that shes not quite ready for,positive
dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority im in charge here,positive
is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance,positive
of course the politics are all wrong,positive
a cowboy president even down to his name with big guns shoots his way through problems,positive
much like the american collective memory of jfks camelot the image is wondrous if you dont look too deep,positive
the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film but they work here,positive
no matter what political spin you put on the story the movie is an outstanding one,positive
i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the countrys future not a common belief nowadays,positive
now if we only can get ford to run for president,positive
just because one actor didnt work out as chief executive doesnt mean that a different one couldnt,positive
michael redman has lost count of how many years hes been writing this column 21 years 22 years while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes,positive
carry on matron is the last great carryon film in my opinion,positive
made in 1972 it still features most of the regulars of this genre,positive
sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac hattie jacques retakes her role as matron and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr goode,positive
the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard,positive
this time williams is after matron jacques when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr goode,positive
the doctor hawtrey is sworn to secrecy i assure you that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other,positive
bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself,positive
there are great cameos from joan sims an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks hes at work at the railway station,positive
sid james gang including cyril his son kenneth cope try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home,positive
he has to share a room with nurse ball barbara windsor and she soon sees through him,positive
the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospitals pills with panic ensuing,positive
there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous matrons,positive
williams is as usual on top form but sid james isnt given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all,positive
the same does not go for charles hawtrey for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time he seems to steal every scene he is in,positive
by not making use of sid james and barbara windsors talent to full effect the film seems to flounder but it certainly makes up for it with its good storyline and its other appealing characters,positive
this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored,positive
you dont want to be like mike,positive
mike has been doing badly,positive
embarrassingly bad,positive
he broke up a sixyear relationship six months ago to move from n y to l a and hes still not over her,positive
as a result his jokes fall flat when he tries to impress and hes a comedian,positive
well an unemployed comedian one of hollywoods little fish and it has gotten so bad hes asked for an application at starbucks,positive
actually the starbucks thing gets even worse,positive
and worse,positive
you wont fail to like mike however played endearingly by jon favreau,positive
swingers revolves around mikes halfhearted and awkward efforts to get back in the social swing of things,positive
to this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething actor friends such as trent vince vaughn with the films most animated performance who has the gift of gab bordering on the disturbing side of motivational speaking guntoting sue patrick van horn and rob ron livingston who once played hamlet but now longs to work as goofy in disneyland but doesnt succeed because of his lack of theme park experience,positive
together they talk about women how to make eye contact which involves avoiding it and when to call so as never to appear desperate two days being industry standard,positive
after talking the talk they walk the walk strutting like the cool swingers they aspire to be always to laughable effect,positive
to get mike out of his funk his friends persistently convince him to get outside whether it be to a quickie night trip to a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a 50s swing lounge,positive
everywhere they encourage mike to look for a replacement honey and then keep vigil over his progress or lack of it,positive
like dotty doting parents mike never leaves their company without being the recipient of their confidence cheerleading youre money mike and the honeys know it or equipped with their eccentric dating philosophies such as an analogy of flirting with the bear and the bunny,positive
with the unwavering support of friends like these maybe mikes not doing too badly after all,positive
favreau also doubled as the films screenwriter and he proves he has the gift for creating engaging characters and witty banter that goes beyond todays bon mot,positive
there is a reassuring honesty to the friendships even when it hits its low points and the friends commiserate,positive
when mike gets the gumption to look for love you will join his cheerleading section as well,positive
swingers is light unassuming fare sweet candy you will want to bust your gut with laughing again and again,positive
apparently director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film american history x i dont know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether,positive
ive heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce,positive
as it is i found american history x to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of a powerful charismatic performance from edward norton,positive
its hard to believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself a star,positive
norton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year,positive
he plays a young man named derek vinyard a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly dangelo and sister davin jennifer lien,positive
the film opens with a flashback in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car,positive
we find out that this lands him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny,positive
in the presenttime of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother,positive
much of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that leads to dereks adoption of white supremacy,positive
when derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now a fullblown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things,positive
what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms,positive
its hard to make a controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material,positive
because american history x is a mainstream film there has to be a redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic,positive
i partially disagree with this because although i do not advocate racism in any way its interesting the way kaye presents derek he is a loud obnoxious man but hes also very smart,positive
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men,positive
its clear that hes passionate about his beliefs and that hes not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up,positive
of course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part,positive
its astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest,positive
in addition to getting the look just right hes perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and a whole lot of shouting and norton does it all with ease,positive
even when hes at his meanest derek has a likable quality to him and thats a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead,positive
what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of dannys school avery brooks becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny,positive
the other performances are all terrific with standouts from furlong dangelo and lien,positive
visually the film is very powerful,positive
kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slowmotion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere,positive
but like a lot of movies lately american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes,positive
although the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends with a pretentious preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed,positive
for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point it felt like a slap in the face to be handfed a theme in such a simplistic way,positive
it makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film,positive
perhaps this last scene was the problem,positive
its hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good in a time when so many movies are timid and weak american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way,positive
glorystarring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freemanis the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war,positive
broderick plays robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle,positive
shaw the son of welltodo abolitionists hailed from boston high society,positive
the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory,positive
as the film begins in 1862 shaw is a captain in the northern forces,positive
like private eriksson michael j fox in casualties of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the warthat is until his company is attacked by enemy forces,positive
shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck,positive
soon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort,positive
glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery,positive
the film periodically jumps between shaws point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers,positive
the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action,positive
the large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth,positive
he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight,positive
his bitter tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability,positive
washington provides much of the films intensity and emotional power,positive
in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army,positive
when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave,positive
it makes your blood boil,positive
the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings a tear rolls down washingtons cheekand will probably run down your cheek as well,positive
the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasnt deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores,positive
freeman is as usual a strong presence even in a small supporting role,positive
he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember,positive
he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers,positive
colonel shaw recognizes freemans leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army,positive
andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles a free black who is one of shaws close childhood friends,positive
searles is educated and refined like a white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake,positive
the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat,positive
the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment,positive
the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships but somehow they never lose their morale,positive
the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens subjecting them to racism and discrimination,positive
they are paid only 10 a month whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen and for a long time they have to go without shoes guns or uniforms,positive
to make matters worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor,positive
eventually however the regiment receives its boots uniforms rifles and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw,positive
shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it means threatening a general with blackmail,positive
broderick in fact is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment,positive
unfortunately however brodericks uneven performance is in many respects the weak link in the movie,positive
in an effort to look more mature broderick sports a mustache and a goatee and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent,positive
he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced,positive
the film places too much weight on brodericks character and not enough on the black soldiers who are more intriguing,positive
glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war,positive
the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july,positive
glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts,positive
except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head the film for the most part leaves the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid,positive
to the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying its just that director edward zwick the cocreator of thirtysomething films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster,positive
the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers,positive
the movie depicts some of but not enough of their customs and rituals,positive
in one scene for example the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire,positive
each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration,positive
a couple of the movies most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe disbelief and pride,positive
the regiments greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner,positive
like any war film glory has its share of gloom and despair but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say or more precisely what they do not say blacks played a critically important role in the norths victory over the southforever changing the evolution of america,positive
mickey mouse had better watch his back theres a new critter in town and hes the nameless animal attraction of mouse hunt dreamworks skgs clever first foray into family fare,positive
although it runs out of steam towards its end this liveaction comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disneys entire 1997 nonanimated kiddieoriented catalog,positive
but consider that list includes dismal tripe like air bud flubber and that darn cat and its really not such a difficult feat to pull off,positive
still throw the two rodents in a boxing arena and ill be hoping that the mouse from mouse hunt knocks some sense back into mickey,positive
nathan lane robin williams significant other from the birdcage and lee evans last seen as a nervous bellhop in the fifth element play ernie and lars smuntz befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father william hickey in his last role a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion,positive
although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect,positive
but theres a lone obstacle in their way a single mouse lives within the walls of the house and hes not about to give up his place of residence without a fight,positive
movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite,positive
the effects blending the talents of 60some live mice one animatronic mouse and one computergenerated mouse are pretty seamless,positive
the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burtons mind the smuntzs architecturallyunsound mansion is like something straight out of the nightmare before christmas and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent prices warped contraptions from edward scissorhands,positive
mouse hunt is a pretty dark movie even some of the humor can be grim but its hardly ever meanspirited,positive
the star of the show is neither the topbilled lane nor the titular mouse,positive
its lanky british comedian evans whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleanedup jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill note a toneddown but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease evans banter with the everaffable lane is funny stuff too and holds its own against the movies more flashy physical shtick,positive
vicki lewis beth from newsradio is solid in a supporting role as lars moneygrubbing wife,positive
and in a nifty bit of novelty casting christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a calcium deficiency,positive
blech,positive
a basically onejoke idea a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans is given a rather engaging execution,positive
their sparring is imaginatively realized i dont think ill ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda and although you really never fully root for either side thats okay a warmandfuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share,positive
mouse hunt may take a while to get going the rather lengthy setup could test the patience of some of the younger children although i rather liked it much in part to lane and evans and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable not unlike the original home alone,positive
cinematically speaking gordon parks original 1971 shaft is not a great film,positive
a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidymans black private dick thats a sex machine to all the chicks to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking,positive
yet nearly 30 years after its original releaseand long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decadethe 1971 shaft remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness,positive
the reason for this is the same one that explains the films connection with moviegoers far beyond the target africanamerican audience the title character of john shaft,positive
while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broadbased appeal stems from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass,positive
this fact also explains why john singletons y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is,positive
much like the film that started the franchise this shafts plot doesnt score points in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers,positive
contrary to what has been reported over the past few months this shaft is not a remake of the original film but more of a,positive
the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels 1972s shaftsbigscore and 1973s shaftinafrica richard roundtree once again plays john shaft who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city,positive
however the focus of the film lies on his samenamed nephew samuel l jackson who as the film begins is a cop whose takenocrap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors,positive
when a privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of a brutal raciallymotivated murder is allowed to be released on bail a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p i,positive
but thats easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez jeffrey wright a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime,positive
peoplesor rather wright is also the big obstacle in jacksons way toward commanding this film,positive
peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stages,positive
however he isnt so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming,positive
its no easy task to steal a film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but thats exactly what wright doesand makes it seem effortless,positive
then again with such a talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jacksons impressive star turn doesnt quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other costars,positive
bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in americanpsycho so it only follows that his performance as a similar less exaggerated character would be spoton,positive
collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened conflicted diane,positive
busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shafts sidekick rasaan,positive
registering not as stronglybut through no fault of their ownare vanessa williams as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez and a dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno,positive
jackson also has little to do in a sense some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside his shaft doesnt even have one sex scene,positive
that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since hes not really an action director,positive
this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases,positive
they move well as does the film as a whole and are reasonably exciting its just that theres nothing terribly inventive about them,positive
these set pieces are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but theyre unsurprising and conventional,positive
but if theres anything that a shaft movie does well its make the familiar look cooland this shaft keeps that tradition alive,positive
from the slick title sequencescored of course to isaac hayes everinfectious oscarwinning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the filmon the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado,positive
even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced it feels necessary,positive
style doesnt exactly make for a great film but when it comes to shaft thats of little consequence,positive
what matters above all else is having a good time and the latest shaft should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad muthashut your mouth,positive
what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber,positive
to answer the question you get director david mirkins new comedy romy and micheles high school reunion,positive
romy white mira sorvino mighty aprhodite and michele weinberger lisa kudrow tvs friends have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987,positive
however when former classmate heather mooney janeane garafolo the truth about cats and dogs confronts romy about the 10 year reunion she is astounded that she forgot,positive
watching pretty woman for the umteenth time they are reminded of how they wouldnt let julia roberts character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance,positive
then it hits them they are not successful,positive
what are she and michele going to do,positive
romys instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames bag a couple of boyfriends and get jobs,positive
romy says this will be easy but michele retorts that if it is so easy why hadnt they already done it,positive
robin schiffs script keeps the show moving with some nice oneliners,positive
one of the best has romy reminiscing about her lifes battle against the bathroom scales,positive
i was so lucky getting mono she says looking at her thinnest high school picture,positive
that was like the best diet ever,positive
the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed,positive
romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school,positive
the films editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life,positive
at sagebrush high the hierarchy consisted of the a group cheerleaders the b group drama club and the c group nerds,positive
romy and michele were none of the above,positive
ridiculed as the weirdoes they were constant targets for abuse,positive
even though they were quite attractive they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others,positive
that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them,positive
complementing romy and micheles lightness is janeane garofalo as the dark pudgy heather mooney,positive
heather who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go has the success and the money that they would like,positive
heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school,positive
garofalos onedimensional role is only a side show,positive
this is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of,positive
the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy,positive
they have so much fun acting out their parts their enjoyment spreads to the audience,positive
hedwig john cameron mitchell was born a boy named hansel in east berlin,positive
as a teen seeking his other half he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g i,positive
luther maurice dean wint,positive

now a she hedwig comes to america is abandoned by luther forms a rock band and falls for her 17year old g tommy only to be rejected by him later too,positive
she and her band the angry inch shadows the nowfamous tommy gnosis across the us for revenge but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in hedwig and the angry inch,positive
first time helmer john cameron mitchell along with stephen trask created and starred in their acclaimed offbroadway production that has become the movie,positive
and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs outrageous costumes sets and makeup and especially a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character,positive
mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for,positive
i am by far not a big fan of musicals,positive
sure there are exceptions like bob fosses all that jazz and cabaret but for the most part they are just not my cup of tea,positive
hedwig and the angry inch is an exception though with its combination of humor wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from the rocky horror picture show and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols,positive
the original songs by stephen trask also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch are full of energy and variety and even though its not my kind of music i found every one entertaining and fun,positive
the audience i saw hedwig with thought so too,positive
the main attraction to this one show is the presence of its star,positive
john cameron mitchell gives a solid sometimes fun sometimes angry performance as a person searching for selfenlightenment and love,positive
as a young boy growing up in east berlin hansel is abused by his g i,positive
father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that mother would make me play in the oven where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio,positive

she meets falls for and loses young tommy who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation,positive
jealous and angry hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommys tours and with the help of her manager phyllis stein andrea martin is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs,positive
hedwig and the angry inch get gigs not coincidentally at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing,positive
things finally come to a head so to speak in new york city,positive
the popularity of the offbroadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a readymade audience base for hedwig,positive
the wit humor music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been,positive
it is this one show that casts its spotlight on its internationally ignored rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role,positive
there isnt a lot going on with other characters though there are amusing little sidebars like hedwigs backup yitzak miriam shor deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of rent as a puerto rican drag queen,positive
the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film,positive
attention to details hedwigs costumes and outrageous cabaret like makeup the seedy trailer park setting and the kitschy seafood restaurants are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds all on what has to be a beer budget,positive
hedwig and the angry inch may not be for everybody but the energy of the effort the songs the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch,positive
if youre a fan of contemporary edgy music it is an even bigger draw,positive
i give it a b,positive
one of the best things about my job is that every so often a film still catches me by surprise,positive
spy kids certainly did,positive
an adventure story aimed primarily at children the movie is smart zippy fun,positive
the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience,positive
the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable likable kids and their parents are get ready for this intelligent capable and loving,positive
bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous wellstaged action scenes avoid excessive violence,positive
what a relief it is to be able to review an allages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics,positive
consider the other pg rated family friendly movie in theaters now,positive
see spot run has a mother going out of town leaving her son with an idiot neighbor,positive
body function humor abounds including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop,positive
what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film,positive
the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process,positive
at the hospital the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didnt bit off the other one because two metal replacement balls would clack together,positive
of course the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells,positive
somebody clue me in when did genital mutilation become funny,positive
spy kids is a welcome antidote to the repellent see spot run using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness,positive
carmen alexa vega and her younger brother juni daryl sabara live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents gregorio antonio banderas and ingrid cortez carla gugino,positive
mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children,positive
what the kids dont know is that they are also former spies,positive
once agents from different countries assigned to erase each other they instead fell in love married and retired to raise a family,positive
needless to say they get drawn back to the business,positive
shortly into their first joint mission they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop alan cumming a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts junis favorite tv show,positive
but there is evil behind the scenes as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children,positive
papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him,positive
back at home uncle felix cheech marin shows up to reveal mom and dads secret to the kids,positive
after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish while a slew of wicked people including teri hatcher chase them,positive
during the course of their adventures they get to use jet packs electroshock bubblegum and supercomputer sunglasses,positive
they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floops tv show,positive
they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms legs and heads would normally be why are the guards so ineffective,positive
because theyre all thumbs,positive
they move from one colorful locale to another including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from star trek,positive
the storyline is silly and convoluted but even at its most dense it is easier to follow than either mission impossible movie,positive
director robert rodriguez from dusk to dawn maintains a frenetic pace with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes,positive
a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family,positive
alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team squabbling the way kids do but coming together when it counts,positive
antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes,positive
even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments a virtual cloudbacked chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film,positive
had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that i would have enjoyed the film more and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mcubiquitous company,positive
regardless spy kids is a hoot offering fun for adults and children alike,positive
and just think they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle,positive
swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults,positive
steven spielberg may not have directed he only executive produced but his touch certainly is evident in this movie,positive
and he knows a money making winner when he sees one,positive
the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster big action funny comedy and the pacing of a rollercoaster,positive
hopkins plays don diego de la vega otherwise known as zorro,positive
a fighter for the people he is eventually captured by don rafael montero stuart wilson who also unintentionally kills his wife,positive
the film cuts to twenty years later where vega still wants to montero dead,positive
however hes far too old now and trains up thief alejandro murrieta banderas to become the new zorro,positive
banderas motive,positive
to avenge the death of his brother who was killed at the hands of captain love matthew letscher who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie,positive
with the scene set the movie goes on full blast with sword fights aplenty and witty one liners,positive
banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorros playing each other off with ease,positive
hopkins seems to come off a little better but banderas does some excellent work,positive
as the bad guys wilson and letscher seem one dimensional but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way,positive
the audience does hate them which cant be bad,positive
catherine zetajones also pops up as hopkins daughter and although she provides little more than the usual female lead she delivers a charming but one note performance,positive
the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones,positive
theres a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed until jones clothes fall off all together,positive
the director fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye 1995 handles the film perfectly,positive
the action is well done and fast paced the comedy put across well,positive
the cast help a lot but the direction is still outstanding,positive
although the film is very long the plot keeps chugging along and theres barely a dull moment,positive
however the film is a little over indulgent and it could have been trimmed,positive
it manages to hold the attention thankfully and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel,positive
screenwriters john eskow ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script,positive
although theyve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action the plot itself is barely existent,positive
theres lots of little sub plots hanging around but theres nothing substantial to bring them all together,positive
the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to buy california using gold stolen from the guy hes buying the land off,positive
this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines,positive
however this doesnt seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film so the film is never quite sure where its going,positive
in the end however zorro provides action and comedy in spades,positive
it suitable for everyone so put the guilt behind and put some more money into spielbergs bank account,positive
you wont regret it,positive
on june 30 1960 a selftaught idealistic yet pragmatic young man became at age 36 the first head of government of a newly independent african state formerly the belgian congo,positive
two months later he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides,positive
this littleknown story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in lumumba,positive
patrice lumumbas eriq ebouaney story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary lumumba death of a prophet virtually guaranteeing that his new fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject,positive
peck with cowriter pascal bonitzer begins at the end of the story of the young political leader,positive
we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men,positive
images of hatchets saws and fastemptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image,positive
jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgianowned congo,positive
a third class postal worker lumumba speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes proclaiming himself not tribal not regional but a national leader,positive
his small mobile party the congolese national movement mnc is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer and get his face known in the bustling capital stanleyville,positive
at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world lumumba is in the right place at the right time and through political savvy and chesslike manipulation achieves a position of leadership of the mnc,positive
as the date for independence approaches he tactically positions himself to be the new nations first prime minister and defense minister supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu maka kotto,positive
the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the countrys vast natural resources of copper diamonds gold and more,positive
lumumba wont seek the help of the us knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government,positive
his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination,positive
the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves belgian troops violently intervene the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe pascal nzonzi and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad,positive
this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimesodious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries,positive
peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50s and 60s,positive
during the time the story takes place many new nations including nigeria and somalia were born with varying degrees of success and failure usually dependent upon which country colonized them,positive
some colonial masters were better than others,positive
the effort involved in lumumba is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades if at all,positive
production values are first rate on what must be a small by us standards budget,positive
the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique,positive
the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeomans work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumbas life,positive
the political side of things is evenly told in a linear straightforward manner that teaches not preaches,positive
it concentrates on the good deeds of the man if a bit as a stalwart saint but doesnt embellish on a larger than life persona,positive
the family side of patrices life is handled in several perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child,positive
i know the intent is to flesh the man out but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba,positive
the story as such has a lopsided feel about it,positive
high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character,positive
the actor gives a convincing charismatic performance as the multifaceted politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions,positive
in true docudrama tradition the supporting cast does not outshine the star complementing his good efforts instead,positive
lumumba is a solid interesting educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos both,positive
it has more intelligence in its telling than anything ive seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b,positive
jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities but whom you end up liking anyway,positive
in as good as it gets the character in question is melvin udall a successful novelist with obsessivecompulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible except when he feels like being a royal pain in the youknowwhere,positive
hes mean,positive
i mean really mean,positive
the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium,positive
every day melvin eats at the same cafe sits at the same table and gets served by the same waitress,positive
you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance when his waitress carol helen hunt tells him he can just go sit in another section and all the other waitresses just cringe,positive
one day melvin makes a comment that goes to far and carol genuinely hurt comes down on him like a ton of bricks,positive
at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course but is also the only person who can get to him too,positive
another person who often crosses melvins sights is simon greg kinnear an artist who lives on melvins floor,positive
aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city simon has the added benefit of being gay making him a prime target,positive
simons friend frank cuba gooding jr also gay does not fare much better,positive
when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital and frank who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor intimidates melvin into watching after simons dog while he convalesces,positive
this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage,positive
an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in melvin gets to like the dog and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvins softening up to the world around him,positive
it doesnt happen overnight but throughout the film he bites his tongue here cares a little there and most miraculously falls in love,positive
one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others,positive
hes traveling terra incognita here and it shows,positive
good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film especially by nicholson and hunt,positive
they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen,positive
greg kinnear who is becoming known for his supporting film roles is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon,positive
he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels,positive
cuba gooding jr performs with a hypedup level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear and comes through with a near constant comic performance,positive
the screenplay by mark andrus and james l brooks is clever touching and funny,positive
the best part about it however is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting,positive
melvin is a man we cant quite figure out but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention,positive
carol is a working woman living with her mother trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem,positive
simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers but who is still not accepted by much of society,positive
combined with the talent of the actors these characters make the film,positive
the one noticeable area where the film is lacking however is the absence of cuba gooding jr through the second half,positive
his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary but the film ends before his return leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved,positive
i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general in addition to a part in the films conclusion,positive
theres one actor who will probably not be recognized by any awards but who contributes greatly to many of the movies best scenes and who deserves mention,positive
this is that little dog,positive
he plays such a pivotal role to melvins character development actually serves to forward the plot and has some absolutely scenestealing moments that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal,positive
award or no however when even the dog puts in a good performance you know youve got an outstanding movie,positive
at first glance daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie,positive
on second glance it looks that way too,positive
although as typical disaster movies go daylight isnt that bad,positive
admittedly it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by think poseidon adventure,positive
but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the havent i seen this scene somewhere before,positive
feeling that creeps up all too often during the film,positive
sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new yorks emergency response team,positive
by sheer luck he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film,positive
what disaster is that,positive
you ask as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat,positive
glad you asked,positive
through a whole sequence of entirely probable events about as probable as hitting the lottery a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city,positive
the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends which causes not only massive loss of life but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel,positive
good old sly who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses offers his services to the rescuers who gladly accept it,positive
sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft think judge dredd which he can only go in and not out off and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside,positive
so begins the fun but the fun has to be quick because this tunnel has started to spring a leak,positive
the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie,positive
not superb by any means but far above some of his other films think judge dredd again,positive
daylights acting is probably average or a little above in terms of this sort of genre starring this particular star,positive
amy brenneman is the only actor of any note and she does a pretty good job as stallones reluctant helper,positive
oh yeah stallones real life son sage is in this too,positive
sage nice name,positive
i guess it could be worse he could have been named nutmeg or parsley,positive
note to sage you are still young,positive
go to school and get a good education you dont have a future in acting,positive
the plot runs along the same lines as the acting interesting but predictable,positive
mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks,positive
the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie,positive
as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle another one seems to pop right up even worse than the last one,positive
i realize that it wouldnt be much of a movie otherwise but it does make the movie a bit predictable,positive
adding to the predictability is the cast of characters which of course has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy in this case stallone doesnt know what he is doing,positive
why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together,positive
would this be too much to ask,positive
cant we all just get along,positive
special effects werent bad but ive certainly seen better,positive
some of the scenes while fun to watch were such blatant ripoffs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim,positive
especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater the tunnel of course starts to flood,positive
i really expected gene hackman roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute i wasnt sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure,positive
i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas the poseidon adventure is a good one to use,positive
the underwater sequences aside from the deja vu were very well shot and worked fairly well,positive
they were the best part of the movie by a long shot,positive
better than average stallone flick,positive
i realize thats not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume,positive
but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger,positive
daylight is a fun movie and as long as you arent expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised,positive
the most amazing thing about paul coxs innocence is how unlike a movie it is,positive
i mean that as the highest compliment,positive
if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40yearold romance id want to run and hide,positive
the sex scenes would be handled as a farce producers would shed 20 years off the characters ages so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence,positive
along with a charming romantic story the innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable,positive
the romance gets started when former musician andreas charles bud tingwell learns that his true love claire julia blake lives nearby,positive
they decide to catch up on old times but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair,positive
complicating matters is andreas frail health and claires longtime husband terry norris who cant understand why hes suddenly become obsolete,positive
in my mind the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire than the feelings of everyone involved,positive
john claires husband endlessly questions what he did wrong,positive
claire initially insists shes a grownup but admittedly behaves like a child a prospect that thrills and disappoints her,positive
andreas an agnostic begins to question his fate a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence,positive
cox litters the movie with flashbacks including the repeated vision of a roaring train,positive
its a reminder of andreas and claires past love as young lovers they met by train but as it recurs we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed,positive
a pall is cast on the whole affair,positive
a master of the understated cox strings together a series of memorable moments,positive
in andreas dream sequence amidst the roar of the train and conversations we get the whole picture of andreas and claires love,positive
we also get glimpses into john and claires relationship,positive
during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward claire admits to john about her indiscretion telling more than any monologue could,positive
all thats heard is the scraping of forks against plates,positive
the characters are unlike anything ive seen theyre people,positive
so many times movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky,positive
or theyre reduced to comedic buffoons,positive
ordinary people with a pile of emotions claire and andreas arent sure what the next step is,positive
they do want to be happy which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what theyve known throughout their adult lives,positive
bravo to cox who wrote the script for not making john a monster so that claires affair is automatically justified,positive
norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claires love difficult to accept,positive
we feel for him,positive
hes a decent man,positive
sure he may have become complacent but he never expected this especially now,positive
with so much presented to the audience its only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive which it does,positive
however in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers cox displays a skill and lan isnt likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon,positive
three things i learned from being john malkovich when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 12th floor of a building always bring your crowbar dont stand in the way of your wifes actualization as a man and whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being wear old clothes because hey its muddy in there,positive
being john malkovich is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time,positive
wildly surrealistic yet presented in a downtoearth funky style this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head,positive
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it,positive
from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself theres a lot to think about here,positive
just dont forget to have fun,positive
clearly all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did starting with writer charles kaufman,positive
i wrote being john malkovich without an outline he explains in the press notes blindly with no sense of direction or purpose,positive
its important to me that i dont have a map before i start,positive
this allows me to surprise myself stay engaged discover things and hopefully allow the unconscious to surface,positive
spike jonze mark wahlbergs na ve buddy in three kings takes it from there,positive
the whitehot director of the beastie boys sabotage an awardwinning parody of 70s tv cop shows as well as numerous other music videos and commercials eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut,positive
jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a lowkey style,positive
his flat matteroffact approach works perfectly,positive
and then theres the cast,positive
john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive but decidedly erotic puppet shows,positive
over the years his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte cameron diaz has devolved,positive
once passionate lovers the two are now little more than courteous roommates,positive
financially strapped craig takes a job as an entrylevel file clerk at lestercorp located on the 7 12th floor of a manhattan building,positive
navigating around dr lester orson bean his 105 yearold boss and floris mary kay place lesters dotty secretary craig tries to settle into his new position but two things keep him distracted,positive
first theres the beautiful and imperious maxine catherine keener who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her,positive
and then theres the hole behind the file cabinet which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich,positive
craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich where they can experience life from his point of view with enough concentration you can even influence his actions,positive
after 15 minutes the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike,positive
then things get a little weird,positive
by the way if youre concerned that i gave away too much of the plot rest assured i barely scratched the surface,positive
one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre setup,positive
instead he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another persons identity,positive
he also examines the consequences of the malkovisits to craig lotte maxine and of course john malkovich himself,positive
the performances are superb,positive
malkovich best known to mainstream audiences for his work in dangerous liaisons in the line of fire and as head psychopath in the guiltypleasure con air tweaks his own image in a dandy selfdeprecating turn,positive
far from his effete vaguely reptilian persona this malkovich is just another schlub drinking with his pals and trying to get laid incidentally charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his wellearned bad boy reputation,positive
as always john cusack nails his part handily pulling viewers along even as craigs actions become unconscionable,positive
the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz both playing against type,positive
kenner usually cast in icy subordinate roles is terrific as a highly intelligent extremely manipulative femme fatale,positive
cameron diaz barely recognizable under a mess of brown curly hair sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich,positive
being john malkovich stumbles towards the end as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots,positive
additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale,positive
regardless this contemporary alice in wonderland is a real treat,positive
i enjoyed watching being john malkovich but only later after reflecting on the film did its resonance fully hit me,positive
at one point craig says do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is,positive
truer words were never spoken,positive
catherine deane jennifer lopez is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up,positive
she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma but the boys parents arent happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life,positive
as if trying to assure the boys parents wasnt hard enough on her a new development arises that furthers the strain on deanes mental faculties,positive
a vicious serial killer named carl stargher vincent donofrio has been kidnapping women locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into lifesized dolls,positive
just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia,positive
the police led by fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victims body but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state,positive
in a last ditch attempt they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering starghers mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell,positive
a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours,positive
initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix,positive
while it does share some characteristics with both films particularly the first forty minutes which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm,positive
the buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh who won many awards for his video of r e m s losing my religion wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story and a good portion of this film supports that theory,positive
despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments the cell does feature some remarkable imagery,positive
all of the sequences where we delve into someones mind are incredibly beautiful including the dank mind of stargher whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h r giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe,positive
the first sequence that takes place in starghers mind is by far the best featuring one of the most ingenious traps ive ever seen in a film involving a horse which no one seeing this film will probably forget a zoolike display of starghers victims which are animated like marionettes and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room,positive
if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant but alas the sequences only become more silly as they go along despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film,positive
the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance magnified by ten thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed,positive
in my opinion donofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful i e,positive
the newton boys feeling minnesota the thirteenth floor and the velocity of gary that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him,positive
the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him,positive
detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film as it contains heavy doses of both,positive
besides the nipple ring removal i mention above there is also starghers penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs prior to his catatonia and capture which will have audiences recoiling,positive
a sequence where catherine enters starghers mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting,positive
one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device,positive
as a narrative film the cell is sorely lacking,positive
as a collection of images though the cell is extremely well done,positive
although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half singh has done what he supposedly set out to do make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together,positive
unfortunately a wellwritten script should have been considered too because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv provided of course that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos,positive

synopsis investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation,positive
townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them,positive
cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery,positive
comments tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years,positive
batman of course is perhaps his bestknown film and led to a string of less successful sequels,positive
hes done biographical work on the director ed wood childrens movies nightmare before christmas and a homage to alien invasion movies mars attacks,positive
sleepy hollow his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies,positive
sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s especially hammer studios reworkings of dracula and frankenstein and american internationals series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe,positive
christopher lee in fact star of many hammer productions over the years appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders,positive
the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s,positive
one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein,positive
i mention these allusions for a reason,positive
seasoned horror film fans including myself will smile at their inclusion in this film,positive
with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies especially the blair witch project the most overblown turkey of the decade we needed a film like this,positive
not only does it have a sense of history but burtons skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror,positive
the films eerie landscapes and foggy towns indeed overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie,positive
johnny depp a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands plays ichabod crane who has apparently changed occupations from irvings original story and is now an investigator,positive
depp is adequate in his role,positive
no more no less,positive
equally adequate is christina ricci who plays the love interest in the film,positive
shes a good witch too,positive
how cute,positive
one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters,positive
the two actors however carry the movie well enough but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine,positive
veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers,positive
while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing,positive
you have to pay attention,positive
andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay,positive
hes the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven,positive
walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood and sleepy hollow certainly doesnt hurt his growing reputation,positive
as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker sleepy hollow is quite graphic,positive
theres a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings,positive
this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to,positive
a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 30 minutes covering the youngests eyes with her hand,positive
he was obviously upset by the movies intense violence,positive
if youre looking for a good scare however sleepy hollow is definately recommended,positive
linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction and her being cast as dogmas lead is nothing short of inexplicable,positive
shes still in fine form as bethany an abortion clinic worker whos lost her faith,positive
one night a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethanys bedroom,positive
he is metatron alan rickman the voice of god and he needs her help she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey churchthe fate of the universe depends on it,positive
god would do it but is missing having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again,positive
bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the prophets jay jason mewes and silent bob kevin smith doing doubleduty the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smiths films thus far,positive
at some point rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus the undocumented and very black thirteenth apostle and offers his assistance as does divine stripper serendipity salma hayek,positive
its a wild ride,positive
theyre in pursuit of loki and bartleby damon and affleck respectivelythis is probably the sharpest either has ever been who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return,positive
loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates,positive
at one point he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets,positive
its a nasty guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks how corrupt are you,positive
wings of desire this aint,positive
since debuting with clerks smith has grown as a director particularly in terms of working with actors,positive
chris rock is this films only weak linkbetween jokes hes wooden,positive
his nofrills visual style hasnt changed much over the years though dogmas widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations nor has his writinghis characters still sit around delivering one caustic hilarious speech after another,positive
dogma chips away at big religious issuesnamely the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefseloquently and articulately but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition,positive
as well the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever,positive
any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum hurlyburly anyone and eventually dogmas pacing goes slack,positive
a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings comes at a point when weve heard enough,positive
because his change of heart bartleby is initially the good cop to lokis bad drives the climax said rant is given a great deal of screen time,positive
sure affleck deserved a big moment damon steals their scenes together prior but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated,positive
like tarantino smith was a videoage sponge who became a samplemad indie filmmaker,positive
dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies including indiana jones and the last crusade with silent bob doing his best harrison ford and weird sciencea shit demon attacks our heroes,positive
smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan catholicism wow and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished,positive
i bust ed a gut on several occasions,positive
proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever,positive
its a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease for to read it one actually has to see dogma,positive
the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christs martin scorseses 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis controversial novel in that it is not directly linked to the pictures content but to rumours and heresy,positive
theres a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against,positive
not one of them had watched it,positive
every single person refused,positive
smith and scorsese have a lot in common and so do the two films in question because both smiths bethany and scorseses jesus are hollow shells without their faith,positive
in fact dogmas denouement which follows a thrilling showdown thats worth the wait is a catholic lovein a veritable recruitment poster,positive
i felt sentimental about a religion i dont belong to,positive
now thats powerful filmmaking smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god and that spirituality shines through,positive
its enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins,positive
my religion is movies,positive
when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine in a roundabout way theyre attacking what i live for freedom of expression through celluloid,positive
i therefore feel that although im no biblethumper im at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers,positive
films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success whether theyre about superheroes batman superman spawn or geared toward kids casper or the arthouse crowd ghost world but theres never really been a comic book like from hell before,positive
for starters it was created by alan moore and eddie campbell who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid 80s with a 12part series called the watchmen,positive
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd,positive
the book or graphic novel if you will is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes,positive
in other words dont dismiss this film because of its source,positive
if you can get past the whole comic book thing you might find another stumbling block in from hells directors albert and allen hughes,positive
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in well anything but riddle me this who better to direct a film thats set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society,positive
the ghetto in question is of course whitechapel in 1888 londons east end,positive
its a filthy sooty place where the whores called unfortunates are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision,positive
when the first stiff turns up copper peter godley robbie coltrane the world is not enough calls in inspector frederick abberline johnny depp blow to crack the case,positive
abberline a widower has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium,positive
upon arriving in whitechapel he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly heather graham say it isnt so and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon cant stomach,positive
i dont think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper so i wont go into the particulars here other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay,positive
in the comic they dont bother cloaking the identity of the ripper but screenwriters terry hayes vertical limit and rafael yglesias les mis rables do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end,positive
its funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because after all an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts,positive
and from hells ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days who holds back the electric made steve guttenberg a star,positive
dont worry itll all make sense when you see it,positive
now onto from hells appearance its certainly dark and bleak enough and its surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did at times it seems like sleepy hollow 2,positive
the print i saw wasnt completely finished both color and music had not been finalized so no comments about marilyn manson but cinematographer peter deming dont say a word ably captures the dreariness of victorianera london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the blackandwhite comic,positive
oscar winner martin childs shakespeare in love production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place,positive
even the acting in from hell is solid with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent,positive
ians holm joe goulds secret and richardson 102 dalmatians log in great supporting roles but the big surprise here is graham,positive
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth imagining her attempt at an irish accent but it actually wasnt half bad,positive
the film however is all good,positive
2 00 r for strong sexuality language and drug content,positive
the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam,positive
fitting since the mediasaturated gulf war became a pop entertainment,positive
while driving through a long flat iraqi desert in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament one of the men under special forces sgt,positive
maj archie gates whos steering command requests a beach boys tune,positive
these men want their apocalypse now moment only instead of surfing they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle armed with automatic rifles,positive
our three kings okay four are good fighters but they dont necessarily take operation desert storm seriouslyits a reprieve from their hellish day jobs,positive
they are gates new father sgt,positive
troy barlow wahlberg sgt,positive
chief elgin cube and pvt,positive
conrad vig music video director jonze,positive
at storys start president bush has declared a ceasefire and american troops are tying up loose ends,positive
barlow elgin and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an assmap that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion,positive
gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation he proposesdemandsthat barlow elgin and vig join him on a treasure hunt,positive
ditching his escort a relentless reporter named adriana cruz nora dunn is easy,positive
so is finding the treasure until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq saddams men are threatening the dictators detractors citizens of his own country with violence,positive
when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck ready to loot the unarmed rebels want help,positive
bush encouraged them to rise up against the government but provided no military support for such cause,positive
gates convinces the vaults guards that this is a postwar mission and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck,positive
the situation could go off without a hitch the former enemies bear no grudges,positive
but the money hungry gates has a conscience and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene he orders barlow elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces,positive
the result barlow is kidnapped and the filmmakers imply that these wouldbe kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime,positive
barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device,positive
his interrogator lost his family to the bombs and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child,positive
he does in chilling lasting images,positive
i liked these scenes best because the political became personal,positive
its one thing to champion the plight of thousands its another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib,positive
russell has shocked us before his first film spanking the monkey is about a young mans affair with his bedridden mother,positive
its great,positive
his second flirting with disaster features a character who has an armpit fetish,positive
one could argue that its easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions though russell disturbs us in three kings by being nononsense about the violence,positive
when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home russell mutes the soundwere paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast,positive
three kings is russells first visually arresting picture,positive
stylistically it stands apart from other war dramas,positive
newton thomas sigels cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy which is of course entirely appropriate,positive
one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen,positive
a friend enthusiastically added its like having sand in your eyes,positive
this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade,positive
three kings was shot in arizona california and mexico,positive
russell throws plenty at sigels camera for it to observeas was the case with russells previous efforts the most absurd moments are also the films most realistic even the most poignant,positive
we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside,positive
if anything three kings settles down and stops surprising us,positive
its climax is pure hollywood no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indieminded russell,positive
subsequently the characters become more cartoonishbarlows posttorture revelry felt phony and chief a strong presence in the first third fails to escape the godfearingultraseriousantiracistblackmanofpower clich so much for cube avoiding token status,positive
the arab players on the other hand duck stereotype,positive
clooney too transforms into a blandly heroic protestormarching with the rebels i waited for him to shout let my people go,positive
hayseed vig notwithstanding the protagonists are very intelligent and selfserving too i had a glimmer of hope based on russells filmography that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture,positive
its not spoiling much to write that,positive
then again what historical importance would such nastiness serve,positive
theres already enough cynicism in the films mentioning of kuwaits oilinfested waters,positive
russell offers the masses a primer on the oftdismissed gulf conflict and pulled off a neat trick a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared,positive
if he set out to make something significant he succeeded,positive
with flair,positive
capsule suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick which isnt necessarily a bad thing,positive
not exactly oscar caliber but one helluva bulletriddled good time,positive
extended review you know i remember when hitmen were evil murderous scum,positive
alas the times are achangin,positive
in a recent string of movies hitmen are suddenly wise cracking funloving killerswithhearts,positive
this brings us to hong kong director kirk wongs first american feature the big hit,positive
oddly enough about the same time last year a similar film grosse point blank was released,positive
advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it,positive
the big hit is quite the opposite,positive
it was hyped as the new film from producer john woo so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action,positive
however theres a sore lack of it which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit,positive
the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver,positive
mel played by mark wahlberg in a dopey milquetoast role is a killing machine he flips spins even breakdances whilst popping caps,positive
sadly he doesnt get a chance to do much of it,positive
except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so the film is in comedy mode,positive
the action at least what there is of it is prime cut stuff,positive
wong after numerous hong kong features makes quite a nice u s debut,positive
however his pacing is a bit off with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough,positive
they start off electrifying and fresh but just kinda stop,positive
normally this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable,positive
luckily we have ben ramseys screenplay a bitingly funny piece of work,positive
the only problem is there might be too much humor one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few,positive
some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mels hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism,positive
the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled some being there only for a laugh which sometimes works sometimes doesnt,positive
overall the big hit may have its flaws but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed gutwrenchingly funny joyride,positive
definately one of the better ways to spend two hours,positive
in tim burtons sleepy hollow there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name,positive
he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe,positive
burtons update on washington irvings classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror,positive
writer andrew kevin walker seven throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine,positive
as sleepy hollow opens were greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau who won an oscar in burtons ed wood,positive
landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow who on a fateful carriage ride through the forest is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider,positive
after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town constable ichabod crane johnny depp is sent in to investigate,positive
landlord baltus von tassel michael gambon explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods,positive
crane is not a man of great superstition and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie,positive
first and foremost sleepy hollow is a fun horror film,positive
as with virtually all burton movies we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly,positive
the horseman are stylish and impressive particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors,positive
but why did i enjoy sleepy hollow as much as i did,positive
although enjoyable it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right,positive
it was the light comic touch that burton applied,positive
the film has the sweetness of a candy apple usually channeled through depps wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane who is no longer a mildmannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities,positive
this is certainly not the only alteration thats been made,positive
as the film progresses it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves,positive
the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together because for the audience its not an issue we particularly wish to be solved,positive
its more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive,positive
still we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burtons keen eye to capture our attention,positive
the costuming is exceptional and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout its recognizable that the script was refined by awardwinning playwright tom stoppard,positive
the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many,positive
a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassels daughter katrina and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent,positive
walken michael gough who appeared in burtons batman films and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles,positive
i suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow lie within the central trio director burton constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy,positive
all of this is not to be taken seriously of course,positive
sleepy hollow is a lavish frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children,positive
if youve got a decent head on your shoulders youll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time,positive
originally launched in 1978 this popular film was reintroduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers,positive
based on the mighty successful musical from broadway grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 6 510,positive
starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles,positive
plot highschool musical set in the 1950s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the tbirds travolta and the innocent and pure sandy olsen newtonjohn from australia,positive
the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song dance and humour,positive
critique funloving energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler,positive
this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950s with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers,positive
admittedly i am somewhat biased in this opinion since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth grease was one of schmoes first bigscreen experiences and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubblegum card collection and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time,positive
but apart from the nostalgic vibe i was still extremely impressed by this film as it continued to amuse me despite my previous dozen or so viewings,positive
this film took john travolta from a dimwitted sweathog on tvs welcome back kotter and transformed him into a moviestar of spectacular proportions saturday night fever 7 510 in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity,positive
unfortunately for the rest of the cast his popularity was not terribly contagious despite their effective showings in this classic movie,positive
on the down side some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off like when sandy sings about drinking lemonade and staying out until 10 with danny in summer nights and the plot isnt exactly the most elaborate storyline ever created but despite these small reservations this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time and believe me i,positive
am not a fan of the musicals,positive
make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the films absolute highlights,positive
and dont forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever youre feeling a little blue,positive
little known facts henry winkler of tvs happy days fonzie fame turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career,positive
both travolta and conaway were smitten by newtonjohn during the filming of this picture,positive
conaway eventually bowed out of the woofest and married newtonjohns sister a year later divorced after five years,positive
the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible,positive
people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized methodical hatred,positive
five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days the first documentary from steven spielbergs survivors of the shoah visual history foundation,positive
the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry,positive
as the introduction explains even as germany started to lose the war the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe,positive
in 1944 hungary had the last big population of jews within germanys reach and they became the last target of hitlers final solution,positive
each of the five tells his or her story,positive
their stories are intercut chronologically starting from normal life in prewar hungary,positive
they recall the nazi invasion of hungary being sent to work camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps,positive
they recall their horrible precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald the deaths of their family and friends their loss of hope,positive
each recalls his or her unfathomable eventual liberation,positive
and finally the last days shows their cathartic pained modernday return to their old homes and the camps,positive
needless to say their stories are horrifying amazing and emotionally draining,positive
by themselves the stories would be forceful testaments but by cutting them in parallel their impact is multiplied by five,positive
the last days is a talkingheads style documentary its mostly pictures of people telling their stories intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage,positive
in this kind of movie its almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed onscreen but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific or at least relevant images to go with his subjects narration,positive
the liner notes one of the many nice features of this dvd indicate that there is some neverbeforeseen historical footage in the last days,positive
its not clear which scene it is,positive
it could be one of two that i hadnt seen before both powerful,positive
one is rare color footage shot by an american of piles of victims in cattle cars,positive
there is something jarring something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white,positive
another segment shows walking skeletons survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore,positive
there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say,positive
but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war moll told a specific part of the story in a new way in greater detail,positive
and im glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject,positive
the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful,positive
xmozillastatus 0009f words for a holocaust documentary but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring when skies are blue and trees are green,positive
also the movie was shot on 35mm film and not video,positive
so the richness and detail are impeccable,positive
the dvds features are plentiful and wellchosen,positive
there is a theatrical trailer for the movie which is a great introduction to the subject matter,positive
there are about fifty still photos both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors,positive
also the disc has two complete versions of the movie widescreen and full screen both on the same side,positive
one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors plus one for the crew,positive
youd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary but theyre not bloopers,positive
instead they are solid moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length,positive
one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film,positive
renee firestone one of the five spoke on camera with dr hans m nch a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz,positive
firestone was aggressive questioning the doctor about what his children thought,positive
the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable,positive
another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz,positive
he ends his prayer by saying forgive me for surviving,positive
its ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film,positive
its ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable television and movies,positive
its ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers,positive
but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well,positive
its only fitting that the dvd with its wealth of interesting and relevant features would also be ambitious and successful,positive
he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother,positive
she inspires his love and his fear and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus,positive
he has a rudimentary grasp of language mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mothers phrases,positive
he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door,positive
he is 35yearsold in body but a child in mind and spirit,positive
he is the premise for bad boy bubby a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby nicholas hope who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment etc etc then one day his father ralph cotterill appears,positive
his father is a shabby downatheels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion,positive
unsurprisingly he is not thrilled with the way his boy has turned out,positive
he is however rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother claire benito and more to the point her ample breasts,positive
soon they are copulating on the dingy couch while bubby crouches confused in the next room acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest,positive
bubbys relationship to the world may be warped but it is at least stable,positive
the fathers arrival disturbs his precarious balance causing an oedipal conflict which endsfreud would be pleasedin violence and as a result freedom,positive
bubby intuits from his fathers arrival that the air outside is breathable he leaves the apartment his past his world behind,positive
so far so good,positive
the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby which bring us to this point are quite brilliant,positive
the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubbys hermetic tworoom universe,positive
it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise bubby is used by his mother for sex he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins,positive
it is grim and savage and appalling but also strangely tenderde heer having imagined a life as bizarre as bubbys does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes but simply empathizes,positive
he observes what it might be like,positive
the intensity of these opening scenes with their minimalist miseenscene immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world and owes much to david lynchs eraserhead not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack,positive
for thirty minutes the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own,positive
then de heer lets bubby out brings him into contact with our world and the film never quite recovers,positive
our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide where he wanders the streets and meets people where he suffers and learns and survives,positive
he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band how an antisocial halfwit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages wisely he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group he is imprisoned and raped he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension he is loved by a motherly largebreasted nurse carmel johnson,positive
it goes on by turns inventive silly tasteless endearing and sometimes all of these things at once,positive
de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world the tone shifts uneasily from fable to realism to satire and back again,positive
the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest the film is best understood as a kind of parable and indeed the religious implications of bubbys experiences are foregrounded icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mothers walls bubby dons a priests collar stolen from his father a church organplaying atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief the woman who redeems him is named angel,positive
the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubbys mind do not fragment him into psychosis rather the world accomodates him and heals him,positive
although de heers touch is at times overbearing bubbys salvation is touching what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ve humanist tale of improbable hope,positive
a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community,positive
he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art and turning the band into a popular draw,positive
innocence triumphs,positive
bubby becomes a holy fool an idiot savant and graces us with wisdom,positive
its a strange turn of events but by now we shouldnt be surprised because bad boy bubby aint like other movies,positive
not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets lies,positive
like bergman director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations,positive
also like bergman leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ravished and wracked faces,positive
and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergmans own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film,positive
all that is missing is a discussion of god,positive
which is not to say that secrets lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master,positive
in fact it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind,positive
nonetheless what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place that it takes some effort to adjust to the films rhythms,positive
once the adjustment is made however there are great rewards,positive
one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is,positive
though leigh may have adopted some of bergmans stylistic touches most obviously in an early scene of terse crosscutting during a married couples strained conversation as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any style at all,positive
whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality leigh makes the camera a mere observer almost as in a pbs documentary,positive
the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors,positive
it is a tribute to everyone involved that despite such scrutiny only infrequently are we aware that anyone is acting,positive
much has been made of brenda blethyns performance and rightly so but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is,positive
there are a few missteps,positive
for one except for one scene tragicomic as it happens there is scant humor in the film,positive
this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout,positive
and occasionally as with bergman the bluntness of the situations can seem forced,positive
for all that this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention,positive
it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film,positive
in fact it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it,positive
there is even a sweet but significant irony in the films unspoken take on race relations something an american audience at least would do well to observe,positive
nonetheless secrets lies is not for the faint of heart,positive
though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen,positive
needless to say it is also very depressing at times,positive
but for many of us of course so is life,positive
and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better,positive
its hard not to recommend the others,positive
the supernatural thriller written and directed by alejandro amen bar open your eyes adroitly establishes and maintains a lowkey atmosphere of menace,positive
the cinematography by javier aguirresarobe is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances,positive
but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied,positive
overall the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old twilight zone episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented only to learn they are actually a childs toy a military test subject or a department store dummy,positive
watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter i always wanted to shout get on with it,positive
as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in the others my reaction was much the same,positive
set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii the story focuses on grace kidman who tends to her children anne alakina mann and nicholas james bentley and worries about her husband charles christopher eccleston a missing serviceman,positive
anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time,positive
at the beginning of the film three servants mrs mills fionnula flanagan young mute lydia elaine cassidy and mr tuttle eric sykes an aging gardener join the family,positive
the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not,positive
to make matters worse the children are upset nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts,positive
grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them,positive
thats essentially the whole story with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear,positive
earlier there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog,positive
the visuals in the otherworldly sequence courtesy of aguirresarobe are simply astounding,positive
i also enjoyed the presence of religion a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural,positive
grace is a christian and answers her childrens questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper,positive
when mother is away though the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore just as real children do,positive
but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending,positive
the others sets out to be a classic ghost story but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist,positive
all great things come to an end and the dotcom era embodies that perfectly,positive
beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dotcom darling the company kozmo com,positive
an online convenience store stocked with ice cream porn videos and other basic necessities of a urban dweller all handdelivered by couriers within an hour,positive
designed in 1997 by two college roommates joseph parks a 27 year old goldman sachs banker and yong kang kozmo flamed out in three short years raising more than 280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon com,positive
by december 1999 the company boasted 4 000 employees in 11 cities its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention,positive
the company was set for an ipo in may 2000,positive
until april 14 2000 the day the stock market took its first big dive ending the internet era,positive
by april 13 2001 kozmo was out of money and ceased operations,positive
unlike the earlier similar documentary startup com which chronicled the rise and fall of another dotcom govworks edreams focuses both on its original founders especially park and on the common folks that ran the daytoday operations,positive
the contrast is amazing showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing,positive
the films director wonsuk chin too tired to die expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with onthespot interviews with the bike messengers general managers and floor staff that kept kozmo humming,positive
the films images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise,positive
the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding to a degree the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanictype businesses,positive
in the films final interviews with park we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers dont return phone calls,positive
in the end the name of the game was profit and if you couldnt make money even the dreamers got the axe,positive
screened at the 24th annual mill valley film festival,positive
in the opening shot of midnight cowboy we see a closeup of a blank movie screen at a drivein,positive
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses hooves,positive
without an image projected onto the screen the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our minds eye,positive
even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema,positive
but do cowboys really exist or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper,positive
exploring this theme director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept,positive
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend,positive
midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream like image of the cowboy is merely a myth,positive
as joe buck migrates from place to place he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself only further degeneration,positive
during the opening credits joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads john wayne the alamo,positive
as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show a lady on the air describes her ideal man as gary cooper but hes dead,positive
a troubled expression comes across joes face as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone,positive
having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody,positive
joes persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream,positive
he romanticizes about making it in the big city but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance,positive
by the end of midnight cowboy joe buck loses everything and gains nothing,positive
just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success,positive
but how realistic are these ideals,positive
joe had raped and been raped in texas,positive
the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas,positive
alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation,positive
the ability to pack up ones belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention,positive
schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joes abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny,positive
we understand that joe adopts the fa ade of a cowboy a symbol of virility and gallantry as an attempt to neutralize his shame,positive
he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york,positive
in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joes encounter with the gay student joe buck spills ketchup on himself,positive
standing up we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh,positive
schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joes virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals signifying emasculation,positive
beyond the symbol of castration the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgins first sexual encounter a reference to joes first homosexual liaison,positive
the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joes emasculation,positive
it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients but effortlessly attracts men,positive
joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and faggot stuff,positive
there are two predominant images of new york,positive
the first is that new york is the rich cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty,positive
the other new york is travis bickles new york a seedy corruptive hell on earth,positive
joe envisions new york as the former but is presented with the latter,positive
mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men,positive
joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions,positive
the people steal joes money the landlord confiscates his luggage and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity,positive
what has become of joes american dream,positive
schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party,positive
joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food drugs and sex,positive
at the party all of joe and ratzos desires are made flesh joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami,positive
contrasting joes daily struggles shots of warhols crew display wanton indulgence,positive
there is an irreverence in the partygoers attitude we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular orgies breaking out in the periphery and drugs passed around like party favors,positive
the party makes a mockery of joe s ideals,positive
joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joes toils,positive
the american dream schlesinger suggests is merely a proletarian fantasy for those who are content no longer dream but become indolent,positive
as joe heads to miami all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him,positive
his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished,positive
for joe nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately he surrenders the identity,positive
tossing his boots into the garbage he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami,positive
the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus more introspective taking only a few glances outside the window,positive
instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe,positive
reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus window with joe hardly taking notice,positive
the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before,positive
the world seems smaller to joe now the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream,positive
no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means,positive
midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream,positive
there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family,positive
then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock with perseverance can make a fortune in the big city,positive
joes attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york,positive
during his search for an intangible paradise joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man,positive
an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream joe bucks progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons,positive
saving private ryan dreamworks running time 2 hours 48 minutes,positive
starring tom hanks edward burns tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the greatest war movie ever made saving private ryan is an harrowing saddening and riveting movie,positive
it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion but its certainly one of the best war movies made and one of the best of 1998,positive
tom hanks stars as a captain whos troop has to find private ryan damon who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action,positive
action drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him,positive
after the disappointing amistad 1997 spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie,positive
im not the war movie genre biggest fan but i found this film to be gripping and very scary thanks to the excellent cast direction and terrifying battle scenes,positive
tom hanks is superb straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles such as in forrest gump 1994,positive
this time he plays the role with gritty realism and is much better for it,positive
occasionally he overacts the sentimentally but he generally delivers a fine performance,positive
edward burns looking a lot like armageddons ben affleck also delivers a top notch performance moving away from his roles in films such as shes the one 1996 tom sizemore makes less of an impact but is still watchable and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today,positive
spielberg directs very well putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes,positive
and what battle scenes they are,positive
theyre truly terrifying yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen,positive
the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky handheld camera and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique,positive
the gore and violence isnt spared either which body parts flying and blood spurting,positive
this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults,positive
other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90s film making,positive
the cinematography is excellent and the music score by john williams is also superb,positive
it is never intrusive and adds to the drama onscreen,positive
but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan theres one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film the writing,positive
it is unusually flat with many of the speeches strangely weak,positive
the film never really makes any profound statements,positive
this is not a major gripe as private ryan is a film of action not words,positive
still the script could of been a lot better,positive
thankfully the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines,positive
saving private ryan in the end is an excellent film but not the greatest war movie due to its weak acting,positive
this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it as its rewarding and extremely worthwhile,positive
it really shouldnt be missed and dreamworks skg has finally found its first hit movie,positive
wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon denise richards and neve campbell that deals with all the issues sex love murder and betrayal,positive
the setting of the film is a town named blue bay,positive
it consists of many swamps and slums and on the other hand rich estates owned by the towns different benefactors,positive
the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the towns ritzy expensive high school,positive
it is here that we meet all of the core characters,positive
theres guidance counselor sam lombardo police officers ray duquette and gloria perez dark mysterious senior suzie toller and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan,positive
we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor but none more than kelly,positive
throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape,positive
shortly after suzie too confesses that sam raped her as well,positive
this pushes kellys sex craving mother sandra to stop at nothing until sam is convicted,positive
during the trial kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her,positive
however it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor,positive
after sam is cleared kellys mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her,positive
it is then revealed that sam kelly and suzie were all in on it together,positive
it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda,positive
matt dillon stars as sam lombardo,positive
sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage,positive
he isnt the obvious best of actors but dillon does give a convincing performance,positive
however his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles although he never had many to start out with in the first place,positive
neve campbell who most people relate to scream and scream 2 plays blue bay outcast suzie toller,positive
suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film,positive
campbell is very successful with this character adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch,positive
playing kelly van ryan is denise richards,positive
kelly is your typical rich sexy head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses like her sexpot mother sandra,positive
one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother,positive
denise richards still hot off the press from starship troopers gives the most interesting performance in the entire film,positive
in the beginning kelly looks to be a paper thin character but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy but dominating as well,positive
kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette,positive
this character looks to be one of the most boring predictable in the film,positive
however it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story,positive
still the film doesnt seem to gain much from bacons performance only his name,positive
in the supporting cast theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan daphne rubinvega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez and bill murray shines as sams lawyer ken bowden,positive
hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film,positive
although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller the eroticism which is portrayed with good taste is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters,positive
this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with its share of twists,positive
available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment 29 95 with an introduction by david carradine written produced by wayne j keeley,positive
f w murnaus career ended sadly and prematurely,positive
the german director of such classics as sunrise and the last laugh died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount,positive
murnau was reportedly a giant man well over six feet a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance,positive
which brings us to nosferatu a symphony of horror surely he felt a kinship with his title character the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck in one of the most indelible images in film history silent or otherwise schreck rises from his grave gnarled hands outstretched and hes so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame,positive
the plot of nosferatu,positive
is liftedunauthorizedfrom bram stokers dracula,positive
the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania,positive
he leaves behind girlfriend emily only to discover orlocks secrethes a bloodsuckerand struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love,positive
in addition to schrecks performance the cinematography and effects are outstanding,positive
arrow videos digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixedcoffin,positive
the cover art features a redtinted hairy goateed vampire staring straight at you his fanged mouth agape while the bodies of two sexy writhing women entice you below,positive
trouble is murnaus monster is palefaced bald pointyeared and nongoateed and there isnt a single sexy writhing woman to be found in his movie,positive
this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted,positive
additionally notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnaus film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire,positive
that said a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself,positive
the original elements are not in the best conditionnonstudio silents were unlucky in their preservation so were still dealing with a slightly washed out scratched jittering image,positive
but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue respectively especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatus waltzing around during what seems like sunlight it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties,positive
the title cards have been redone and they are legible accurate and digitally altered to flickera very nice touch,positive
even the opening copyright warning flickers,positive
the score has been replaced by music from type o negative a hardrock group arguably gothic and their songs underscore the film nicely certainly the coolest video a band can ask for,positive
when our hero hutter first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlocks castle we hear a welltimed now youre dead,positive
from lead singer peter steele,positive
david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film,positive
after the feature which runs about 63 minutes is included a new music video from type o negative the blackandwhite fangfest black no 1,positive
of course nosferatu a symphony of horror is the main attraction and while my latest viewing raised questions why is the woman called emily in the title cards but mina as bram stoker called herin hutters letters for instance it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from,positive
coppolas 1992 bram stokers dracula owes a great stylistic debt to murnaus masterpiece but the one thing it couldnt thieve was the originals abstract charms,positive
this latest incarnation from arrow will probably like the rescored metropolis a few years backturn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks,positive
one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel,positive
that concept although many purists doubt its scientific credentials spawned many interesting novels comic books and films in the last century,positive
however the big granddaddy of time travels h g wells novel the time machine wasnt written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences,positive
the author h g wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich idle capitalist class and impoverished labour,positive
whatever intentions wells had the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages,positive
instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space,positive
the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration,positive
first of them was george pal who in 1960 directed film which would through the years become genre classic of its own,positive
the plot revolves about george rod taylor victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension time,positive
at the eve of the new 20th century george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention machine that would enable him to travel through time,positive
they are skeptical but that doesnt prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future,positive
at first he travels slowly seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars,positive
finally after witnessing world war three he travels far into the future hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions,positive
when he finally reaches year 802 701 ad at first glance new world looks like utopia humanity consists of young beautiful but idle eloi people who are fed clothed and taken care of by unseen machines,positive
but weena yvette mimieux eloi woman tells george about another side of the coin in the night her people is preyed upon by morlocs humanoid creatures from the underworld,positive
the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times,positive
for h g wells it was frightening threat of class struggle for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie,positive
even the modern audience which would be tempted to discard the film as oldfashioned could find some values in its universal messages fit for each era,positive
compared with the genre films of today the time machine is even better and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent thoughtprovoking films,positive
of course since this is hollywood product after all the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness,positive
for example it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today,positive
some of the final scenes that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero are also rather unconvincing,positive
but on the other hand the film is very well directed cleverly paced and the special effects although definitely oldfashioned are more than adequate for this kind of picture,positive
the acting is good with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as georges trusted friend filby,positive
yvette mimieux who plays weena on the other hand would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role,positive
however despite all those flaws the time machine is a very good piece of cinema something that connoisseurs of quality sciencefiction films sorely miss these days,positive
what surprises me most about the longawaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker,positive
the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis,positive
i can hear batfans everywhere protesting first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker,positive
and indeed this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play,positive
nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding oscarworthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman,positive
nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown romero played the joker in the 60s tv series,positive
on one hand nicholsons joker is extremely funny,positive
his murderous escapades and manic outbursts which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film,positive
but on the other hand his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind,positive
the jokers cruelty and demented diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister,positive
this guy is off his rocker and he not only knows it he flaunts it,positive
but enough about nicholson as the joker im sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman,positive
like many i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader,positive
but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting,positive
keaton delivers,positive
he is convincing as the tormented millionaire bruce wayne and beneath his hard black body armor he is mysterious and formidable as the batman,positive
even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city,positive
visually batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team,positive
the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as the dark knight returns and the killing joke,positive
burtons film is a feast for the eyes the 35 million budget is definitely on the screen,positive
the sets costumes and makeup are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations,positive
nicholson isnt joking when he boasts wait till they get a load of me,positive
his grimacing smile green hair and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous,positive
keatons wardrobe is equally appropriate,positive
batmans cape mask and body armor make him look threatening frightening and invincible bringing to mind not adam wests campy costume in the tv series but peter weirs outfit in robocop,positive
production designer anton fursts sets are a wonder,positive
gotham city is dark and foreboding almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york,positive
the batcave is cold bare and desolate,positive
the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption,positive
the movies gritty look is a joy to behold,positive
the plot on the other hand is not as rousing,positive
the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting,positive
it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear,positive
batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology but it fails to give us enough of either one,positive
as i mentioned earlier the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker but it never fully establishes batmans psychological motives and underpinnings,positive
in terms of action batman is not as thrilling as you might expect,positive
burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story,positive
more than anything batman is a mood film,positive
while batman may not completely absorb and excite you it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books,positive
thanks to its distinctive look the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world,positive
after a rather disappointing mary railly stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise,positive
this is one of the best surprises of this season a sweet small budget comedy with a big heart,positive
in fact its not even a comedy,positive
its a drama or even more precise a clever satire on human relationships and needs,positive
based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby high fidelity is a wry and likable story about a mans quest for fulfillment and happiness,positive
rob gordon was a dj,positive
it seems that he could make everything spin except his own life,positive
now he owns championship vinyl a little musical store somewhere in new york,positive
when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend a gorgeous blond attorney life suddenly looses every purpose,positive
decimated humiliated and on the verge of a mental and emotional breakdown he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been about whats right and whats important,positive
he starts categorizing life dividing it into top 5 lists,positive
and the most important is the top 5 list over the most painful breakups of his life starting with 5th grade when he found his young girlfriend with another boy,positive
though you might think that people change grow more mature with age it just doesnt seem that way and all robs relationships were different versions of that first,positive
where did he go wrong,positive
was it he that screwed up,positive
or maybe life just stinks,positive
while he is lost in his own selfpity he must think of the top 5 list over his needs for the future find the right elements and mix his life together,positive
with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity music and with incredibly direct narration it addresses the average audience member in other words people like you and me,positive
although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter and frears the director the acting is equally important as the written word,positive
and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned,positive
he is simply superb,positive
it is as much his movie as it is frears,positive
the film would not be the same without him,positive
cusack whose character is sadder wiser and 35 brings intelligence and warmth to post mod irony,positive
most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera not an easy task but cusack pulls it off,positive
his interpretation feels so emotionally right so incredibly realistic and precise that frears message simply cant be ignored or overseen,positive
the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job,positive
both and jack black are fabulous,positive
even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts not just looks beautiful,positive
however the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as robs coworker and friend dick,positive
this is such an impressive achievement that its almost worth a oscarnomination,positive
he is simply a joy to behold,positive
otherwise everyone are in their place and at the right time all part of frears colorful blend,positive
pretty much like edward nortons keeping the faith this film doesnt follow any formula or belong to any genre its dramatic tragic sarcastic comic and even cynical but never bitter or angry,positive
its a little bit of everything pretty much like life itself,positive
nothing seems unreal or staged,positive
it reflects reality as a mirror,positive
as you watch it you go through the same emotional problems as the main character,positive
you feel and think and reflect,positive
this effect has become a rarity nowadays,positive
although its primarily about the perils of love high fidelity is secondarily about pop music,positive
rob owns championship vinyl and his employees timid dick todd louiso and overbearing barry jack black are fellow music snobs,positive
music is the language in their lives the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives,positive
and so does the movie,positive
it is as much a musical film as anything else as robs journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments,positive
in the end you have gained something while watching it,positive
its not the film of the century or even of the year,positive
its not an special effects extravaganza,positive
it doesnt require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed,positive
its a small movie about the big things,positive
and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy you feel as if you have experienced something of significance and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time,positive
this sometimestedious and oftenmoving documentary charts the life and times of anne frank the young diarist and mostfamous victim of adolph hitler,positive
producer jon blair has collected a staggering amount of historical material on both anne and the frank family,positive
we meet miep gies one of the familys protectors who is still alive,positive
she recounts how she found the diary in the days after the germans captured the franks,positive
we watch otto frank annes father and surviving family member in interview footage filmed before his death,positive
blair successfully combines these clips footage and other historical records to recount exactly what happened during that terrible period of european history,positive
as narrated by kenneth branagh and with diary excepts read by glenn close anne frank remembered retells more than just annes story,positive
we meet and learn about the many friends family members and acquaintances whose lives were touched by this young woman and her writings,positive
winner of the last years academy award for best documentary,positive
its been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but its been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths to emerge so radiantly,positive
id saw that its been at least a couple decades even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers though im hardly comparing a simple plan to say rear window or strangers on a train,positive
yet its almost as good,positive
its simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point to plot point and merely laying out theymightbecaught overtones it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral,positive
elegantly directed by sam raimi yes the same a simple plan concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dimwitted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe,positive
without anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking and so they generally dont flaunt anything they dont want to flaunt theyll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton,positive
the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse a they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities b they could try to fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous or just or c they could fight amongst themselves,positive
a simple plan though borrows a little from each of these,positive
a little tiff with the cops here a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent a chilling gary cole there and a bit of inside feuding over here,positive
but as austin powers would say thats not necessarily its bag baby,positive
what i most admired about this film and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that its successfully able to have its cake and eat it too,positive
it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag,positive
so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up and these subsequent steps go miserably awry the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity,positive
in one early scene paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesnt look like it was all stolen not a bad idea when thornton screws up as he does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has to do some major coveringup read homicide,positive
instead of a quick murder and immeadiate handswashing raimi shows a lengthy painful shot from a lowangle onto paxtons face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion,positive
theres a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder hes committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gutwrenching,positive
in short probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results for further proof watch persona s sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done,positive
but the film hardly stops here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof,positive
yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story,positive
when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played by bridget fonda a pal to raimi he does and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights,positive
theres at least two grand shootouts and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history and when they arrive they dont come with masochistic delight but with cringeinducing horror,positive
during the one i was actually sinking into my chair with the mantra they cant do this can they,positive
streeming through my head,positive
in fact this film which is getting many comparisons to the coens superior but forget about it fargo has many similar moments of manic insanity attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what in other hands would be overthetop distractedness imagine i suppose robert rodriguez directing this then,positive
again after seeing the evil dead films id hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed raimi moments a rifleshot notwithstanding,positive
instead raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch easily letting the story and characters coexist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches,positive
most particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob is a brilliant creation,positive
his dimwittedness is often hilarious for most of the film every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter but theres authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that were not totally laughing at him,positive
the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of fullcondescension because thornton is so damn real,positive
jacobs a multidimensional character and while being stupid we see that as not so much a flaw but a strength to his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and coconspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money,positive
the final third of the film spends much time with him and many of the touches upon his character not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b smith adapting his own book by the way are just great,positive
i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to nearsweetness and further strength of his saddened character,positive
thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance by far the best performance hes ever given and further proof that hes the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you dont believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary colors a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadnt been in the same year because hes easily able to slip into a character and make him completely and utterly believable,positive
he brings so much weight to the film that as it is with most character actors its difficult picturing anyone else in the role,positive
the rest of the cast is great too from paxtons declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff,positive
even fonda shows off her talents nicely,positive
and if i had any complaints about the film its that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at times it seems too much like an exercise like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved,positive
and the occasional narration is as it usually is annoying narration should be used with extreme caution especially when youre trying to set things up express emotions didnt raimi watch the first murder scene,positive
and the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie the ending is basically amiss,positive
i wont reveal it but its way too cruel and too much of an outsider setup as if the appearance of a plane wasnt already too much of that anyway,positive
for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved this is the wrong ending,positive
imagine a charactercontrolled ending otherwise its like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that im at all comparing a simple plan to dostoevsky,positive
the ending does work despite my protestations but to me there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it then just ignore me and go about your day,positive
but despite my mere claims make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured not because of any kind of gore factor which is thankfully for this very minimal but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ive frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile,positive
at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece,positive
no humans were harmed tested or tasted in the making of this film,positive
all recipes are fictions,positive
twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism,positive
a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul,positive
antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves,positive
they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive,positive
this true story briefly mentioned in the shining has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture,positive
in 1847 the united states was a land of pioneers of goldstarved americans making their way west,positive
it was a period of manifest destiny the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could,positive
capt john boyd guy pearce has become both a hero and a victim during this period of relentless consumption,positive
in ways he could never have imagined,positive
boyds journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexicanamerican war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california,positive
upon his arrival he is greeted by a small motley group of soldiers including his commanding officer hart jeffrey jones a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life toffler jeremy davies the forts personal emissary to the lord knox stephen spinella the veterinarian that plays doctor who never met a bottle of whiskey he didnt like reich neal mcdonough the nononsense soldier of the group and the seriously overmedicated cleaves david arquette a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions,positive
into this cold bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger colqhoun robert carlyle a halfstarved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound,positive
seeking refuge in a cave they soon ran out of food and were forced to consume one another,positive
colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors doeuvre himself,positive
our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors and colqhoun tags along to help out,positive
soon it becomes clear that colqhouns tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive,positive
it involves an old indian myth called weendigo which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that persons strength spirit and very essence,positive
his hunger becomes an insatiable craving the more he eats the more he wants and the stronger he becomes,positive
there can never be enough and death is the only escape,positive
its all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through,positive
as professionally made as the movie is you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this,positive
teenage horror fans wont care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell,positive
older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit but theyll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces,positive
but jokes aside this is a film that is well worth watching,positive
it has wonderful and mature characters that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end,positive
the two main characters are also the most interesting,positive
boyd is a simple honest man tiered of war killing and fear,positive
his sacred wish is to live a normal quite life away from gunpowder and blood,positive
colqhoun is different,positive
he proves that a man on the brink of death would do anything to stay alive including sacrificing his own soul,positive
he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically,positive
it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen,positive
the atmosphere in ravenous is macabre and bizarre scary and surreal,positive
completely isolated from the rest of the world stands fort spencer,positive
here time stands still and nothing changes,positive
the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage,positive
they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life,positive
men that are nothing and has nothing to loose,positive
the result is some sort of cabin fever,positive
cannibalism is more like a sick game for them,positive
since they find no pleasure in living they find some excitement in killing and dying,positive
its like whos going to die first,positive
the unchangeable icy landscape where birds do not sing and even wind doesnt move the leaves on the trees resembles kubricks the shining,positive
its hard to not get mad here,positive
one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters and starts to understand them although they have turned into half crazed killers,positive
music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere,positive
a strange musical score composed by michael nyman the piano and damon albarn that often seems out of place and in complete contrast to the image somehow reflects the characters twisted reactions on the world and their situation,positive
the director herself stated that it was ok to laugh during the picture,positive
and i must admit that it is often very funny in a strange way such as the wonderful quote its,positive
lonely being a cannibal,positive
you dont get that many friends,positive
or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin saying eat to live,positive
dont live to eat but,positive
mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change,positive
every actor does a great job,positive
especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier nagged by his undeserved honor,positive
this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordans interview with the vampire,positive
actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies since the topics are so alike,positive
ravenous starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring,positive
however these little failures dont diminish the impression,positive
this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations,positive
it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyones soul a dark side which were all trying to hide but its there always,positive
it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since the shining,positive
i said no food,positive
i didnt say there was nothing to eat,positive
colqhoun ravenous,positive
albert brooks saves the day just in the nick of time,positive
with a very poor summer for movies brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up and does so in a positive way,positive
while this may not be his finest work the muse still shakes up some delightful humor,positive
in albert brooks latest comedy he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter brooks whos losing his edge as his business partners say,positive
in desperation he goes to see his friend jack jeff bridges who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past,positive
he asks jack for some help and recieves word of a real life muse that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career,positive
so brooks seeks the muse named sarah sharon stone and is suckered into buying her expensive food etc as a sort of payment,positive
the real punch line however doesnt come until the end,positive
it really makes you wonder how screenwriters really get their ideas could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street,positive
the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner,positive
speaking of brooks he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter,positive
every time he graces the screen i cant help but start laughing,positive
albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character,positive
the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone,positive
she wasnt likeable at all,positive
brooks had the right idea with her occupation but she never pulled through,positive
in a way she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak,positive
luckily brooks could clean up the mess and cover for stones mishap,positive
it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance because the muse had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy,positive
on a brighter note andie macdowell was also charming as brooks wife,positive
she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film shes in,positive
the funniest moments in the muse in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese,positive
i mean imagine brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice like it was something out of the ordinary,positive
it was just plain hilarious,positive
it just adds to the satire joke of how directors get ideas,positive
brilliant move by brooks,positive
as i mentioned before the film is a satire much like its proceeder bowfinger which came out a few weeks before,positive
unlike bowfinger this is not a mean spirited film thats desperate for jokes its rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood,positive
bowfinger had its moments but had quite a few problems that were never worked out but the muse still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour,positive
by the end of the film youre glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it,positive
for once im not fully disappointed because the film didnt slow down it kept moving even with some flaws,positive
thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort,positive
i think hell still manage to keep his edge around well into the future,positive
men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction action and comedy that hits the target in every possible way,positive
although another alien movie men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didnt and towers above many other movies of its type,positive
the brilliant acting especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay is also as good as it gets,positive
director barry sonnenfeld who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty has crafted a masterpiece,positive
the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be,positive
the men in black or mib are a topsecret governmental agency that is not known to exist,positive
the mib are responsible for saving the world from the scum of the universe,positive
a though job indeed,positive
the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens the human kind being transported across the mexico border and into the united states,positive
presumably these aliens are all migrant workers,positive
that is until the mib show up and begin interrogating them,positive
agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien but a real extraterrestrial alien,positive
when the alien makes a run for it agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mibs very unique weapons and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them,positive
the device described as out of state eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on,positive
from here we are introduced to james edwards played very well by will smith,positive
edwards a police officer is chasing a fleeing criminal,positive
the criminal gives a very good chase and at one point when edwards confronts him the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground,positive
edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go because someone is after him,positive
edwards doesnt take this seriously but when the criminal shows very nonhuman characteristics and leaps off the building he begins to wonder,positive
back at the police station agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions,positive
he informs edwards that is was in fact a nonhuman that he was chasing and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not manmade,positive
he has edwards identify the gun and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day,positive
edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he,positive
after goofing up for half of the time edwards puts on a show at the firing range and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib he chased down the criminal on foot which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do,positive
in the meantime an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter,positive
edgar vincent donofrio owner of the farm investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport,positive
the bug as he is called is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors,positive
and it up to the mib with newly recruited agent jay formerly james edwards to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war,positive
men in black delightfully combines fastpaced action with often hilarious comedy which is usually from will smith although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film,positive
the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot as in another big alien film from the past summer,positive
screenwriter ed solomon writer of super mario bros,positive
and the upcoming xmen film has surely struck gold with this story,positive
all ages will enjoy men in black,positive
it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again,positive
although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes the entire film from beginning to end is a nonstop adventure,positive
the ending of the film which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters is also very well done,positive
a sequel is already being planned so there is more to look forward to,positive
there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie,positive
action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything fullcircle,positive
for fans of both genres however realism is key,positive
action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movies end,positive
on this advice director john frankenheimer the island of dr,positive
moreau strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller ronin,positive
the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing considering the fare thats fallen into the same category over the last few years,positive
the script written by j d zeik in his bigscreen debut approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission impossible two years ago,positive
a certain number of people will be lost by this but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times,positive
frankenheimer masters the script with poise and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of postcold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck,positive
his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here and ronin becomes a better movie because of it,positive
robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time,positive
he takes command and offers much gravity as the exspy sam a man whos called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre natascha mcelhone recover a package,positive
the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast especially once the requisite doublecrossing begins and its role is skillfully penned by zeik,positive
at times however zeiks tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission impossible de niro might easily become tom cruise the package might become cruises computer disk,positive
fortunately the focus here is almost entirely on the package whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the doublecross and why it happened,positive
the action content is impressive and it lives up to the hints given in previews,positive
the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect fullblown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness,positive
ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots,positive
the suspense tapers off considerably by the end a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movies open,positive
considering these factors its good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well and its another good bet this month,positive
since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months its definitely worth the visit,positive
shakespeare you hardly understood it in high school,positive
why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesnt count on it,positive
if this is your attitude then ill say right off the bat that kenneth branaghs hamlet is probably not for you and you might as well stop reading right now,positive
if however you are a lover of the bard or at the very least are openminded about a challenging script read on for there is something rotten in the state of denmark,positive
namely the king has died and his widow the queen has wed the kings brother claudius but prince hamlet suspects foul play,positive
his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brothers hands,positive
hamlet enlisting the help of his friend horatio conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery and,positive
the game is afoot,positive
the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes,positive
with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established,positive
interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers,positive
the hamlet castles grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings mirrorpanel doors and bridges which connect opposite sides of a secondstory loft,positive
costuming is equally grand drawing upon both history and imagination,positive
not quite the denmark of the 1600s the characters attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel,positive
it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars respectively,positive
in addition to directing kenneth branagh also plays the title character,positive
as the revengedriven royal heir branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows,positive
from the anticipation of seeing his fathers ghost to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester to his eventual wrath branagh delivers in spades,positive
every scene truly revolves around hamlet as much a tribute to branaghs acting and directing as to shakespeares manuscript,positive
hamlet seems to be a whos who of shakespeareantrained actors so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself,positive
julie christie as hamlets mother gertrude and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly as do many of the supporting players,positive
kate winslet as hamlets lover ophelia does an outstanding job demonstrating the characters plummet to the depths of dispair and madness,positive
richard briers as ophelias father polonius and michael moloney as her brother laertes are equally convincing,positive
nicholas farrell as hamlets trusted friend horatio and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the twotiming rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast,positive
hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible,positive
in some cases this made for interesting scenes,positive
billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick whom hamlet knew quite well,positive
crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian and the result is a very funny scene,positive
however charleton heston whom many might think would butcher shakespeare is the biggest surprise of all,positive
as the player king the leader of a troupe of traveling actors he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba,positive
part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story with sir john gielgud and judi dench but this is most unfortunate for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time,positive
his offcamera speaking while gripping sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other wellvoiced actor,positive
i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out and let the venerable actor have the attention,positive
unfortunately there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions,positive
jack lemmon an excellent actor just cant do shakespeare,positive
as marcellus the guard who sees the elder hamlets ghost lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him,positive
gerard depardieu another talented actor is wasted when given little more than the utterances of yes my lord and no my lord in the role of reynaldo,positive
richard attenborough has a literally walkon role showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador,positive
i think he had two lines,positive
then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway,positive
when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was,positive
if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you,positive
hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one,positive
branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashbacktype images,positive
this only works about half the time and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them,positive
you dont have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly,positive
the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar the high school english course,positive
in it you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the kings english,positive
or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes,positive
stendhals syndrome a condition where in the presence of art a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression suicidal behaviour and personality disorder,positive
grim stuff to be sure but the subject of a remarkable film from italys master of the horror thriller dario argento,positive
boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento,positive
it follows his disappointing american debut trauma 1992 the patchy opera 1987 and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980s,positive
based on the novel by graziella magherini the film stars argentos daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapistkiller,positive
visiting florence to follow up several leads she is lured by the killer alfredo thomas kretschmann to an art gallery a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail,positive
at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints,positive
posing as a bystander alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer a strange game of cat and mouse begins,positive
a gripping story evolves and a coherent one too which may surprise those familiar with argentos often lumpy narratives,positive
the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cophuntingkiller scenario,positive
it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central characters psychological disintegration,positive
the script explores its psychosexual themes with intelligence and candour perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers,positive
but as dark as its themes are the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years,positive
argento is once again working in his native italy and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences,positive
effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent,positive
the films opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination flashback and realtime with tremendous style,positive
proof that at his most inspired argento remains one of the worlds most exhilarating filmmakers,positive
the cast is generally good though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless,positive
asia argentos performance is by turns risky awkward and fascinating,positive
its a difficult role and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts,positive
thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo and marco leonardi of cinema paradiso and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy does okay as annas work colleague and increasingly confused love interest,positive
but perhaps the stendhal syndromes single most striking element is ennio morricones soundtrack,positive
active since the 1960s morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts,positive
its mostly a variation on the one theme a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards,positive
its been three decades since argento and morricone worked together,positive
this is a long welcome reunion,positive
if the film has a fault it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesnt quite reach a completely satisfying climax,positive
but by the closing scenes the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argentos career,positive
note see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can,positive
dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web,positive
i swear i have seen the edge before,positive
in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different film,positive
however the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot,positive
in doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker,positive
unfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film,positive
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head,positive
one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script,positive
action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre intelligence,positive
even horror films have learned this a genre which is probably the least respected of them all,positive
the river wild was one of the best films i have seen from the 90s,positive
the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day,positive
the edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack of originality is the downfall,positive
i must admit that it was very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes,positive
this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around as in the lost world,positive
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity it could have become a great action film and i use the term loosely,positive
the edge is pretty much a survivalofthefittest film,positive
but taking screams lead the edge makes fun of the genres cliches and then uses them though not quite as effectively,positive
charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him,positive
for once we dont immediately care for the main character,positive
instead we like bob alec baldwin a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness,positive
they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic,positive
charles birthday is the same day and he receives a gold watch from his wife and a pocket knife from bob,positive
as action films go these items do have importance to the rest of the story but quite a bit more than we first expect,positive
soon however bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his personality,positive
charles bob bobs assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and as shown in the previews hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter,positive
down the plane goes the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness,positive
director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations,positive
he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film,positive
take for instance the entire manhunting bear plot,positive
this has been done many times in films with different animals and even bears,positive
but given the charles intelligence and bobs uncertainty many of the cliches are given fresh twists,positive
even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before,positive
my favorite line of the film comes from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didnt do the one thing that could save their life,positive
thinking,positive
despite the predictability of the main plot a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when i realized that everything isnt as it seems anymore,positive
i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise so instead i will avoid it entirely,positive
the first twothirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along and some of charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice,positive
tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the characters lose all sensibility,positive
i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water,positive
why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across,positive
i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while,positive
thankfully we already have begun to care for the characters and so we let this small detail slide,positive
but some of the technical details are awkward such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles,positive
the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature and borders on phenomenal,positive
anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day,positive
hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs,positive
alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game,positive
baldwin can be a good or a bad character and here he succeeds at both in a way,positive
you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the doublenatured photographer,positive
elle macpherson gives a good performance albeit slight,positive
she isnt in the film all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles as an actress not as a model,positive
harold perrineau is a good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed,positive
he is eliminated early and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable,positive
the edge is rated r for graphic violence some gore and language,positive
some of the violence is a little too disturbing even for me,positive
this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to but too many cliches bog it down,positive
director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts,positive
david mamets script though has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid,positive
the best thing about the script is the ending which doesnt end with the normal highstrung action sequence but with a small detail involving a certain gift,positive
its a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear,positive
and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear,positive
way to go bart,positive
jay and silent bob strike back kevin smiths swan song to his two most famous characters is the best received comedy that ive seen since theres something about mary which is a tea party in comparison to the foulmouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back,positive
the audience didnt just laugh they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout,positive
in short if you like really raunchy humor you may find it as i did to be the funniest movie of the year,positive
on the other hand if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smiths dogma then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you,positive
in one of the fastest paced movies of the year the story has jay and silent bob jason mewes and kevin smith a pair of card carrying drug dealers traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie,positive
it seems their comic book alter egos bluntman and chronic are being used in a movie without jay and silent bobs consent,positive
jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it,positive
jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that ive ever seen,positive
among others they include carrie fisher as a bibletoting nun mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell action,positive
best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies,positive
the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was stupid enough to buy tickets to this movie,positive
actually purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory,positive
the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet,positive
guilty,positive
although its filled with inside jokes youll still be laughing even if you only get some of them,positive
its easy to understand enough so that they are still funny,positive
jay is a motor mouth who hasnt met a subject that he couldnt vulgarize,positive
his favorite topic is oral sex but being an equal opportunity profaner hes willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything,positive
but it is his buddy the aptly named silent bob who is responsible for most of the movies success,positive
his reaction shots with his wildly exaggerated eye movements are comedic gems,positive
the storys main subplot concerns four animal rights activists justice shannon elizabeth and her three sexy buddies sissy eliza dushku missy jennifer schwalbach smith and chrissy ali larter,positive
these charlies angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture,positive
jay tries to put the moves on justice but he doesnt stay in command of the situation for long,positive
one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink clamshaped birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry,positive
granted its not the movie for everyone but if you like kevin smiths brand of humor youll find that this is his best,positive
and as i said earlier its the funniest movie of the year thus far,positive
no wait,positive
forget thus far,positive
its bound to be the funniest movie of the year,positive
in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash its great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience,positive
jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 35,positive
it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations,positive
it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older,positive
the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday august 22 2001,positive
in the silicon valley it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters,positive
seen february 15 1998 on home video borrowed from chris wessell,positive
when it comes to modern gangster movies its really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre just using the word routine,positive
ive always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea no matter how many times its been used before can provide for a good story and donnie brasco clinches this idea,positive
its not unlike most of the great films of the genre yet it never apes anothers style as it has a good layer of authenticity even if its core is a tad stale,positive
the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it,positive
we meet lefty pacino an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk,positive
he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this,positive
somehow he comes across donnie brasco depp a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isnt afraid of lefty and his rep and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him,positive
its clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately telling him all the tricks of the trade,positive
i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit,positive
however we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone an fbi agent working undercover a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer,positive
the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor a brief history of the mob definitions of their slang and where their money comes from and who it goes to,positive
the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements however the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original,positive
most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works probably from watching other gangster movies and although this attitude comes across the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable,positive
thankfully the film doesnt become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime and instead opts for character development,positive
much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie,positive
pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would,positive
hes old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be,positive
we learn of his accomplishments which are quite impressive within their context and when he complains about not being made top boss its easy to sympathize with him,positive
newell constantly plays up this aspect making it a major theme which works well in the long run,positive
as donnie is constantly impressing and even oneupping lefty its hard to tell which emotion is more powerful the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed,positive
most of the film tells the story of donnies life in mafia which creates for many subplots and individual conflicts but doesnt always seem to come together as a whole,positive
the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar,positive
the resonance to donnies actual assignment varies he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress but it doesnt always seem to have much meaning,positive
back home his wife maggie heche is ready to divorce him because hes never a and the family is suffering,positive
since this is based on a true story i wouldnt doubt this would happen although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic,positive
my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act or at least any real sense of closure,positive
a climax of sorts does occur but theres little feeling of a payoff,positive
we get a happy ending which is good but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful,positive
aside from a few minor general flaws donnie brasco manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development,positive
it may be routine but its good and thats respectful,positive
the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year,positive
we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics loved by the people and make tons of money at the box office,positive
this year the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic the mummy,positive
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them,positive
that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza,positive
in the mummy the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick oconnell,positive
he teams up with a curious clumsy librarian named evelyn played by rachel weisz to find the mysterious city of the dead hamunaptra,positive
evelyn loves egypt and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable,positive
rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle and thats why she chose him to lead her there,positive
also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyns brother jonathan played by john hannah sliding doors,positive
now in hamunaptra the three uncover the book of the dead,positive
the curious evelyn unlocks the book reads from it and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep arnold vosloo becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book,positive
along with imhotep arising from the dead the ten curses of egypt become in full effect launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra,positive
not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt,positive
dont expect huge things out of the mummy but just expect to have a good time,positive
this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects which may turn off some viewers,positive
on the other hand this type of film is one of my favorites but thats up to you to decide,positive
there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though,positive
the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world,positive
we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert swarms of beetles and locusts and even creatures crawling under a humans skin,positive
these may have been in other movies before but not like in the mummy,positive
as of now the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year but all this could change when star wars episode 1 the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country,positive
in the past brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles,positive
when playing george in disneys george of the jungle he was mainly not known by anyone,positive
i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens,positive
in the mummy fraser gets to play an action hero and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle,positive
although brendan fraser is great rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast,positive
weisz really reminded me of a character from an old horror film,positive
the way she acts looked and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time,positive
evelyn is probably the only character that was likable considering that the other characters like john hannahs didnt get much personal attention,positive
in many films when different genres are mixed the mixing usually works and i like it for the most part,positive
in the mummy though not all of the mixing works,positive
there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror some with potential comedy some with potential drama and some with potential pure action but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work,positive
the mummy could have gotten an a rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these,positive
i didnt mind the corny oneliners here and there during action sequences but it certainly could have done without them,positive
the cinematography is amazing in the mummy,positive
particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt mummies and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians,positive
the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography,positive
from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits the costumes are always top notch,positive
the bottom line with the mummy the summer is off to its usually great start,positive
here is a film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop,positive
okay it isnt quite original considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species but it certainly is smart,positive
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy bhorror films from the 50s and 60s and some even become them,positive
however as we learned with the 1995 smallbudget fi film sometimes expectations can be shattered,positive
a lot of criticism has gone against this film from what i have read so far anywayyep all two reviews and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory laughable pieces of trash,positive
but the thing is it isnt,positive
its well made well acted and quite intelligent,positive
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film,positive
but the species series isnt about the lack of these elements,positive
its about how much it can get into one film,positive
and yet behind it all it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so,positive
species ii begins in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe,positive
many films especially scifi ones create similar timelines as our realistic one but change it to fit the films needs,positive
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mars,positive
aboard is patrick ross justin lazard a very bright and very handsome astronaut,positive
patrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick to succeed,positive
well it would seem that he has succeeded,positive
landing on the surface of mars he is the first human being to ever do so,positive
of course he isnt the first ever,positive
about a billion years ago an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life,positive
now of course the red planet is cold and rocky,positive
no life lives on it,positive
that is no visible life,positive
patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collects samples from the ground,positive
he takes them aboard and puts them in storage,positive
unfortunately one of the samples contains a form of life and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship,positive
just prior to heading back to earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings,positive
they pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug it off as nothing because they cant even remember,positive
they blame it on a technical malfunction,positive
back on earth patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible,positive
as we know from the original this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet,positive
however the children that are bred are halfhuman as their father is,positive
patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he finds it in eve natasha henstridge,positive
eve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien,positive
however this time around most of her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant,positive
the project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable,positive
since she was involved with the original alien attack she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again,positive
and it has,positive
storywise species ii is much stronger than its predecessor but it is also much stronger than say aliens hey i love the film but you cant tell me it was strong on story,positive
what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay,positive
in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles,positive
this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars later it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it,positive
the script uses this effectively but also manages to provide a wellbalanced plot,positive
beginning with the first man on mars something i have always dreamed of seeing i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie,positive
and it does it quite well,positive
the characters are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do,positive
the only character that seems a little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he does,positive
there are the obvious flaws of course mostly lying in the technical aspects,positive
the special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad,positive
but for the most part they remain believable i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children,positive
also the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someones head being blown off,positive
however some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including a menage a troi that is all but necessary,positive
many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence,positive
however i tend to disagree,positive
what were the alien films about,positive
and if an alien species ever did come to earth and their sole purpose was to destroy us wouldnt you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible,positive
my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store,positive
i didnt realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with i just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one,positive
the acting is quite good for this kind of film,positive
it is a vast improvement over the first film at least,positive
the acting is the key element to this film if it was bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it was good it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens,positive
okay so it isnt that good,positive
george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting as his overthetop impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting,positive
natasha henstridge is limited this time around as she is usually enclosed in a cage,positive
however she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent,positive
oh yeah and shes quite fun to just plain watch,positive
marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film,positive
michael madsen is soso but he isnt annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality,positive
james cromwell has a small part but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor,positive
as i say any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability,positive
mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance and he gives the film a more downtoearth feel,positive
and of course justin lazard,positive
lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance but i think he is effective,positive
sure he is wooden but isnt that what his character is like,positive
the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due to the couples acting,positive
species ii is rated r for strong sexuality scifi and language,positive
this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see,positive
more than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives,positive
hell i dont even know if i will,positive
what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year,positive
i probably wont see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while,positive
director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series,positive
medak has also mastered the wonderful jump,positive
moments and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film scream still has the first,positive
strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and a surehanded director species ii is exactly what these films should be entertaining,positive
available for rental october 12 1999,positive
10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play the taming of the shrew,positive
that said drop any preconceived notions of what shakespeares work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school home of a student counselor allison janney who obsesses over the male penis a slightly too hip and racist africanamerican english teacher daryl mitchell a new kid named cameron joseph gordonlevitt a model named joey andrew keegan the subject of cameron and joeys crushes bianca larisa oleynik and biancas sister the shrew julia stiles in a marvelous performance whose name is katarina kat for short,positive
with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedicromance,positive
yet you must realize that the story is timeless and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage,positive
the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and biancas last name stratford,positive
their family is run by walter stratford pretty womans larry miller a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly,positive
in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor the family no dating policy is amended to bianca can date when,positive
katarina does,positive
with prom just ahead biancas fate is grim unless of course she can tame the shrew,positive
dont think this mission to be a simple one as bianca kindly points out her sister is a particularly hideous breed of loser,positive
getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing,positive
when cameron who likes bianca learns of her fathers new rule he is quick to consult a friend for advice,positive
the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit someone with money,positive
in this case that is joey the other guy with a crush on bianca,positive
camerons friend a loser by teenage verdict convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out,positive
the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe patrick verona heath ledger,positive
this verona is far from fair rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison,positive
moreover katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso hoping to nail his leftovers,positive
the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet,positive
providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isnt exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy a party polluted with liquor a best friends betrayal and prom,positive
it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy american pie never been kissed carrie shes all that and cant hardly wait,positive
yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare falstaff was a drunk romeo and juliet met at a party and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way,positive
apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer apart from swashbuckling braveheart,positive
director and former actor ron howard splash backdraft far away most noted for his dramatic film making displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13,positive
being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer with more than us150 million in the states alone this film is his most successful effort yet,positive
perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks gump himself kevin bacon footloose tremors a few good men etc gary sinise forrest gump bill paxton aliens true lies boxing helena and ed harris the abyss just cause,positive
all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles,positive
apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight the worst being the challenger accident,positive
jim lovell hanks the mission commander together with his crew fred haise paxton and last minute replacement tom swigert bacon are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission more than three quarters way to the moon,positive
suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home,positive
if they ever reach it,positive
ed harris and gary sinise who play respectively the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles both delve into their roles superbly,positive
audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space,positive
also there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970,positive
the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well thanks to filmmusic maestro james horner,positive
watch out for the launching sequence it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film,positive
a bad point though apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script,positive
those who consider themselves scientifically illiterate might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show,positive
this is however just a minor point just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film,positive
you should enjoy it,positive
let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film i really wasnt looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films,positive
im not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the everpresent dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years,positive
im happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film,positive
by that point it was evident that mr bond was back with a vengeance,positive
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film werent exactly a pleasant experience,positive
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts,positive
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in,positive
i guess they can be excused though taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain,positive
anyway after somebody remembered what the light switch was for i settled in for bond,positive
i think the most noticeable aspect of this the 19th film in the series is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films,positive
there were probably more oneliners in this movie than in the last several combined,positive
and bonds last oneliner in the film is about the best of the series,positive
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series,positive
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007,positive
for the most part the action sequences worked very well,positive
although there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top even for a bond film,positive
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted,positive
while he did a good job for the most part there were points in the movie specifically during action sequences that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film,positive
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie,positive
he almost seemed like he didnt know what he was doing,positive
but they were brief scenes and really shouldnt take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing,positive
if you have ever seen a bond film you wont be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit,positive
the world is not enough is no exception,positive
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world,positive
007 matches wits with the terrorist renard robert carlyle a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain,positive
why this point is included is beyond me,positive
they took great pains to explain his condition but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought,positive
anyway renard like the typical terrorist that he is is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mideast oil pipeline,positive
i guess world domination just isnt as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore,positive
bond is brought in to protect the pipelines owner elektra king sophie marceau who is the daughter of one of renards recent victims,positive
along the way bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle,positive
like all bond films you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot since it is ridiculous beyond words,positive
my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films,positive
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing,positive
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceaus character,positive
it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly although not included in the film,positive
later it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something,positive
but because it is a bond film the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly,positive
after all it isnt shakespeare,positive
how about the cast,positive
brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007,positive
i grew up with the roger moore version of bond so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character,positive
judi dench as m had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role,positive
she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner,positive
robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie,positive
coltrane gets more screen time which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes,positive
then there are the bond girls,positive
sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today,positive
there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim,positive
those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face,positive
marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest,positive
then we have denise richards,positive
there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks,positive
and after you see the outfits she wears you wont have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producers eyes,positive
i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist,positive
admittedly there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue but other than that she stacks up no pun intended to her bond girl predecessors nicely,positive
i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyles character,positive
while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had his character just never worked for me,positive
the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character but it just never quite got off the ground,positive
i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character,positive
this might have worked well in another movie but i dont go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations,positive
last but not least we have desmond llewelyn as q this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bonds gadget guy and he is as good as ever,positive
although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films he is still a treat to watch,positive
rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role,positive
he says future appearances are up to a higher power,positive
the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese,positive
while we dont see much of him in this film i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyns legacy whenever it is passed on will be in very capable hands,positive
so how does it stack up,positive
despite some problems the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie,positive
and all things considered what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies,positive
this is easily the best of the brosnan films,positive
it may even be the best of the entire series certainly in the top 3,positive
one thing is for sure even after 19 movies there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series,positive
heres looking forward to bond number 20,positive
there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video,positive
no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure the culture and the brotherhood of white supremacy,positive
nice guy ed norton jr who sang in everyone says i love you plays derek a twentyyear old skinhead,positive
dads subtle racism grew large in derek after gang members killed his father,positive
dad was fighting a fire when they shot him,positive
now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart,positive
derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence,positive
at a basketball court black and white tempers flare,positive
derek channels the aggression into a game black versus white for ownership of the courts,positive
when the choice presents itself derek goes for game point instead of the suckerpunch,positive
cameron stacy keach steps in to dereks life as a surrogate father,positive
he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings,positive
keeping his own criminal record spotless he uses derek as a leader and organizer for highvisibility racial intimidation,positive
derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in racemotivated mob crimes,positive
at the bottom of the chain dereks younger brother danny edward furlong made famous in terminator 2 joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong,positive
one night three black youths break into dereks truck which is exactly what derek has been waiting for,positive
outside in his shorts and his tattoo he shoots them all,positive
the third wouldbe thief unarmed is only wounded,positive
in the key scene of the film derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious enraptured awful stomp,positive
the funspoiling nc17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate considering american history x was rated r what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal ecstatic violence,positive
the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief,positive
derek does not resist the cops and as they spin him around to cuff him the film slows down,positive
derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling sadistic satisfied grin,positive
now in prison derek faces new challenges,positive
as the black man in the laundry tells him in the joint you the nigra not me,positive
there is a clique of swastikawearing skinheads but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy,positive
they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation,positive
derek finds himself truly alone truly in danger and truly afraid,positive
when derek finally gets out of prison he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed,positive
without dereks leadership they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture,positive
it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly hes screwed up,positive
in the end he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny,positive
the film ends a little too deliberately too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film but it barely detracts from the overall experience,positive
edward norton gives an oscarworthy performance,positive
although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction nortons performance compensated,positive
an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store,positive
he also captured the essence of an older brother,positive
he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously very lovingly both before and after his change of heart,positive
though clearly not for all tastes this film is bold and daring,positive
the subject matter is ugly cruel and at times hard to look at,positive
nevertheless its subjects are part of humanitys great face,positive
kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating if distasteful american subculture,positive
after a stylistic detour with mrs,positive
parker and the vicious circle which despite its uncomfortable tone was close to being a conventional movie director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow a romantic black comedy about love betrayal and selfabsorption,positive
while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture rudolphs atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing if not always pleasant movie,positive
it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it,positive
until mrs,positive
parker i had not been overly impressed by his movies,positive
i found equinox his last pre mrs,positive
parker effort to be irritating and frustrating,positive
i was somewhat surprised therefore to discover that i liked afterglow,positive
there are several reasons for this but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident mannered aspects of his approach,positive
the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems the story is absorbing and the acting is topnotch,positive
in short rudolph has created a world that its worth spending two hours in,positive
afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples,positive
jeffrey byron jonny lee miller is a cold seeminglyheartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife marianne lara flynn boyle,positive
for her part marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level,positive
all shes interested in is seducing him during those few days when shes ovulating,positive
after he refuses to make love she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor,positive
the other couple lucky nick nolte and phyllis mann julie christie are an older pair but theyre no more content than jeffrey and marianne,positive
a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart,positive
they remain married as a matter of convenience but since phyllis wont allow lucky to touch her they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs,positive
the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable,positive
the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey,positive
the two of them are immediately attracted to one another and it doesnt take long before theyre lounging together naked in her pool,positive
meanwhile jeffrey who is captivated by older women runs into phyllis in a hotel bar is smitten and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains,positive
the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love,positive
sex means something different to everyone to jeffrey its an unpleasant chore a loss of control to marianne its a means to a maternal end to lucky its an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles and to phyllis its a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness,positive
ultimately none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves,positive
the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script but in the performances,positive
jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish callous suitandtie businessman,positive
those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity,positive
lara flynn boyle who wasnt impressive in rudolphs equinox is greatly improved making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability,positive
nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky and he manages to deliver some of rudolphs most pregnant lines with practiced ease,positive
the clear standout however is julie christie who is nothing short of delicious as the worldweary phyllis,positive
her often wry occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the films humor and theres hardly ever a moment when she doesnt steal the spotlight from her costars,positive
i dont know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph detractors but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the directors earlier productions,positive
enough of his trademark style remains however to reassure his supporters,positive
afterglow is basically a fourpronged character study,positive
the plot is not especially compelling but the character interaction is and thats the real reason to see this motion picture,positive
rudolph has painted an able picture of the nonromantic side of love the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction,positive
it is simply amazing how the green mile developed in its three hour running time,positive
based on the stephen king series of the same title the film starts out painfully slow with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue,positive
however as the plot begins to progress the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction,positive
frank darabont who masterfully followed a prisoners story in the shawshank redemption this time follows the perspective of a prison guard paul edgecomb tom hanks,positive
through edgecombs experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law,positive
from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner the green mile is successful in creating sympathy for kindhearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners,positive
the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them,positive
the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb,positive
the ensemble acting in the film is perfect,positive
hanks david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles,positive
they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles,positive
they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience,positive
the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting,positive
some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson sam rockwell and michael duncan,positive
hutchinson playing percy wetmore a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie,positive
every time he appears on the screen the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying,positive
it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks,positive
rockwell an independent film veteran plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection,positive
as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others,positive
this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable,positive
the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill,positive
duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened childlike behemoth very similar to lennie small in of mice and men,positive
his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause,positive
his pain creates pain for the viewer,positive
however it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film,positive
the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at the jerry springer show,positive
the scene containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks,positive
not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief,positive
as the film flashes back to 1935 graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction,positive
his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is the scene is neither sad nor convincing,positive
greene is not even given a final word like some of the other characters and we dont even see him walk the infamous green mile,positive
however as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters such as coffey and eduard delacroix michael jeter as well as the five prison guards the film becomes more interesting,positive
the speed in the green mile is perfect,positive
if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others,positive
the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character,positive
the green mile is so good following the rough beginning that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene,positive
fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing,positive
if you survive the first third of the green mile sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment,positive
quiz show an almost perfectly accurate true story is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid50s twentyone,positive
on this trivial game show contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice on which they wagered an amount of points on,positive
the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win,positive
but after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began,positive
quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants herbie stempel and charles van doren,positive
stempel john turturro a former g i,positive
and your jewish man raising a family,positive
stempel has been the reigning champion on twentyone for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars,positive
in his mind he is the best thing on television and the people love him,positive
although in the mind of the shows producers herbie stempel is getting old,positive
dan enright david paymer in particular feels that the people are tired of seeing a jewish guy from queens with bad teeth and that the kids need someone better to look up to,positive
therefore they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win,positive
someone who can defeat stempel even if they have to resort to cheating,positive
enter charles van doren ralph fiennes a welleducated professor from a widely recognized family,positive
van doren had decided to try out for the game show tic tac dough because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing,positive
but when albert freedman hank azaria enrights assistant spots van doren the two decide that they have found their soontoberuler of the twentyone kingdom,positive
van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer on purpose in order to lose the game,positive
after stempel loses the throne to van doren he starts to feel cheated which he should,positive
meanwhile on his own dick goodwin rob morrow a harvard law graduate has decided to start an investigation on twentyone to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings,positive
his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved,positive
quiz show is an extremely well done movie and robert redfords direction is especially superb,positive
the performances turned in by john turturro ralph fiennes and rob morrow are very good although it seems that turturro stands out more than any,positive
quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film,positive
definitely a film you should not miss,positive
capsule sidesplitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end,positive
but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs,positive
most comedies these days have one flaw,positive
theyre not funny,positive
they think theyre funny but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly,positive
occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem ruthless people for instance which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end,positive
liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny,positive
this is one of the few movies ive seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through instead of a couple of setpieces that inspired a laugh think of the dismal fatal instinct the whole movie works like clockwork,positive
jim carrey playes a highpowered lawyer to whom lying is as natural as breathing,positive
there is one thing he takes seriously though his son and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away,positive
but his wife is divorced and seeing another man and now it looks like they may move away together,positive
the son goes with them of course,positive
the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carreys overthetop persona with reality,positive
then the plot springs into action after being snubbed not deliberately by his father at his birthday the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles that for just one day dad cant lie,positive
he gets the wish,positive
what happens next is sidesplitting,positive
everything turns into a confrontation when cornered by a bum for some change he shouts no,positive
im not giving you any money because i know youll spend it on booze,positive
all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society,positive
he cant even get into an elevator without earning a black eye,positive
and whats worse hes now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture,positive
carrey who i used to find unfunny has gotten better at his schtick even if its a limited one,positive
he uses it to great effect in this movie,positive
there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process theres a grin breaking out across my face right now just remembering the scene,positive
he cant even write the lie his fingers twitch his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning and when he tries to talk its like hes speaking in tongues,positive
equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp dont ask why tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom it fails with semipredictable results and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them,positive
this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end,positive
the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end,positive
a shame too because the movie insists on having a big ridiculous climax that involves carreys character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs then breaking his leg etc a simple reconciliation would do the trick,positive
why is this stupid pentup climax always obligatory,positive
its not even part of the movies real agenda,positive
thankfully liar liar survives it and so does carrey,positive
maybe they were being merciful on reflection,positive
if id laughed any more i might have needed an iron lung,positive
youve probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over keeping the faith,positive
its a fluffy comedy thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer regarding two moral topics love and religion and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide headon,positive
as youngsters brian finn jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio,positive
while their friendship progressed anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support so neither would feel excluded,positive
but tragedy soon struck as anna was forced to move away,positive
now adults brian edward norton and jacob ben stiller hold similar but contrastive jobs,positive
the likable and kindhearted father brian is a catholic priest while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi,positive
on the basketball court they refer to themselves as the god squad,positive
in the relationship field brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory,positive
everything changes when anna jenna elfman returns to new york to visit her childhood chums,positive
now a workaholic she devotes endless hours per week to her business but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again,positive
with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail theres bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters,positive
predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult but keeping the faith is open entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b,positive
edward norton has emerged as one of the finest most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller primal fear,positive
after shockingly bitter roles in american history x and most recently david finchers vicious fight club a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice,positive
not in the least,positive
norton slips into the directors chair for the first time with keeping the faith and here his incisive resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg,positive
weighing every aspect it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut,positive
in addition norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian generating a thoroughly likable screen presence,positive
stiller the zipper guy from theres something about mary is firm and funny boasting a fullyripened comic maturity,positive
elfmans perky repetition can grow tiresome such is occasionally the case on tvs dharma and greg but she seems perfectly rambunctious here,positive
the remaining cast members offer fine support from anne bancroft as jacobs animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice,positive
keeping the faith is the perfect date flick,positive
though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general,positive
there is turbulence during the process of liftoff as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead,positive
once the film does settle in it is often funny and always cheerful,positive
stiller norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities,positive
we enjoy their interaction understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true,positive
this is excluding the ending which is acceptable and all but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements,positive
nonetheless a narrowly mishandled finale certainly wont wipe the smile off your face nor anyone elses in the audience,positive
keeping the faith is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion,positive
aww what the hell,positive
the quality is not quite heavensent but this little charmer could revive our faith in a potentially tired filmmaking genre,positive
there must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere,positive
in the exotic morocco of 1972 a 25yearold english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the 6yearold lucy carrie and the 8yearold bea bella has arrived for a years stay with the selfabsorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold oneroom london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech,positive
at least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers,positive
she has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip doesnt seem like its much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in,positive
drugs a worldwide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there,positive
but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here,positive
in this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an offhanded but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken,positive
even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from,positive
the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freuds granddaughter esther freud who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister,positive
it is written by the directors brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie,positive
the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls,positive
with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui,positive
he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls,positive
the girls readily accept him and there is no bigtodo made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really dont know what to make of the relationship,positive
it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mothers loose attitude and wants to go home,positive
things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village,positive
it seems only that bilals charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has a wife who still lives there,positive
this scene didnt make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also,positive
but i doubt that,positive
the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel,positive
lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl,positive
the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets,positive
kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many a dropout reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose,positive
the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film,positive
the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves,positive
the familys travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her,positive
that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts,positive
it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence,positive
he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him,positive
the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldnt comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories a gift from god,positive
the films weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia,positive
the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same babyboom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by,positive
her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best,positive
she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldnt have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey,positive
after all the mystical trip is the journey,positive
the films strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings,positive
bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity,positive
the little girls are precocious but they are lovable,positive
julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who cares about the children but doesnt know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them,positive
she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where shes at,positive
this is a very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being,positive
and after all is said and done whos to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was,positive
that thing you do from firsttime film director tom hanks is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band the wonders that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country,positive
but the question arrises will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another onehit wonder or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations,positive
the oneders as they are originally known have their first gig at a very smalltime contest,positive
jimmy the lead singer has written a catchy song and intends to play it at the contest,positive
but a short time before the contest begins the current drummer becomes injured and a replacement is needed,positive
enter guy patterson skilled musician who currently works at his fathers appliance store and is looking to break free from the restricting clutches that bind him,positive
he seems to fit in well until the group takes the stage,positive
when they begin to play guys beat is much too fast and the pace is way off for the intended song,positive
it looks as though the group is doomed to failure,positive
but the new song is a hit,positive
this leads to another gig and soon enough the group has an agent,positive
he doesnt do too much for them but they do get their song played on the radio,positive
eventually mr white of playtone records approaches the group and he informs them that they want to release a record,positive
before you can say billboard the band is now renamed the wonders and the members are speeding their way to fame,positive
the gigs are getting better their fame is increasing and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records history,positive
the band is invited to appear in a feature film and they then fly out to hollywood to appear on television,positive
after the appearance on television things start to fall apart,positive
two of the members of the band pretty much disappear and things are not working out well between jimmy and guy,positive
will the band work it out or will they split up and go on their own separate journeys towards success,positive
that thing you do complete with a nifty original song that actually sounded authentic is a fun and enjoyable movie that although it doesnt become clear if it wants to be a comedy drama or romance is a wellmade look into the world of music,positive
tom hanks directorial debut was a good one and should lead to more work for him,positive
capsule the world will come to an end at midnight,positive
everyone knows it and must make a final peace with the last hours of their lives,positive
this is an intelligent science fiction film with no special effects just personalities and ideas,positive
high 2 4 to 4,positive
it is the last night of the planet and several different people are reacting each in their own way to the end,positive
the film covers 6 pm to midnight,positive
the main character is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote and directed,positive
reminiscent of on the beach,positive
but much more so of a story richard matheson wrote the last day,positive
p s,positive
on rereading the 1953 matheson this film is almost a loose adaptation of that story,positive
the similarities may be mere coincidence but they are numerous and they are very striking,positive
us release may be problematical,positive
the title is lackluster and nonmemorable though very appropriate when you know about the film,positive
also provincial americans may not care about the end of the world coming to toronto,positive
they probably would feel it would not affect them,positive
perhaps a pbs release would be possible,positive
patricks family has declared it christmas and are hurt that the adult children will not spend the whole evening with them,positive
grocery stores mostly looted,positive
it seems though that one of everything is left,positive
some people continue business as usual some want sex some react with religion some riot,positive
some people are in total denial,positive
much comedy much drama,positive
very canadian cast,positive
it does not get dark,positive
it is just always daytime,positive
radio playing last night i didnt get to sleep at all,positive
how appropriate,positive
david cronenberg as a kind of bland functionary manager at the gas company,positive
genvieve bujold as french teacher visiting former student,positive
science fiction film with no special effects cost about two million dollars,positive
the person you have been thrown together with by chance becomes the most important person to you for the rest of your life,positive
why would it be so precisely at midnight,positive
what about other time zones,positive
what is the nature of what is destroying the world,positive
naturally at the core of leon gasts when we were kings is the fight itself for what a fight it was,positive
thanks to the business savvy of don king an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman,positive
fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy as much as brute strength that immediately entered boxing lore,positive
with the benefit of the firsthand recollections of that old expug norman mailer this classic conflict is brought back to life,positive
but when we were kings tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match,positive
questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary,positive
gast could hardly choose otherwise considering the vocal uncompromising politics of muhammad ali,positive
a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam ali opens gasts film with a forceful swipe at the united states,positive
when ali hollers damn america the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind,positive
his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury no viet cong ever called me nigger ali reasons,positive
despite showcasing alis proud unequivocal politics one of the most impressive features of when we were kings is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion,positive
listening to the films numerous commentators it is clear that the geographic location for this rumble in the jungle is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map,positive
spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage a coming home to africa,positive
foreman reminds us that africa is the cradle of civilisation,positive
fair enough but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality,positive
it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu a brutal dictator,positive
while ali respects mobutus ability to forge an independent african state mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents wellstocked torture chambers,positive
mailers insights are lost on most of the films commentators,positive
george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo rather than the newly christened zaire,positive
with admirable restraint gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire s squalid ruling elite,positive
mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power,positive
don king resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the messiah label attributed to him by a loyal disciple passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity,positive
understandably foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal,positive
he may be as one sympathiser notes blacker than ali but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali the thuggish mobutu and the tacky huckster don king,positive
africa zaire inspirational leader or vicious dictator all is left undifferentiated unconsidered in this optimistic celebration of black unity,positive
little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that alis opponent wasnt white,positive
admittedly these issues are only hinted at rather than substantially explored,positive
the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves in their own time,positive
there is just too much to cover too much that is truly worthy of celebration for a protracted political analysis to be justified,positive
the excitement of james brown and b b king in concert for instance,positive
and of course theres always ali to consider as he shamelessly and hilariously hams it up in front of the camera shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another we gonna get it on coz we dont get along,positive
doubtlessly considering the multifaceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover the makers of when we were kings faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues and what personalities best deserved their attention,positive
fortunately by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event,positive
charlie sheen stars as zane a radio astronomer who listens for sounds from other lifeforms,positive
when he finally gets one his boss destroys the tape and fires him,positive
naturally zane is not ready to give up and he comes up with an ingenious way to do this himself,positive
he is aided by a young neighborhood kid and they discover that the sound is coming from mexico,positive
so zane goes down there to investigate and runs into a lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly,positive
zane is having marital problems at the time and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting,positive
hearing charlie sheen deliver the line i guess there is something to be said for celibacy is the funniest thing i have ever heard in a movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames,positive
this is just the setup and i dont want to give too much away because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises,positive
charlie sheen who has had a rocky career as of late is in top form here,positive
he is funny serious and determined to accomplish his goal,positive
sheens absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie,positive
the story is ingeniously devised by twohy who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour disaster in time,positive
the films major flaw is a very slow pace and not much happens in the earlygoings,positive
viewers may be growing restless for a while but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it you will have a good time,positive
up until about a year ago john travoltas career consisted of those look whos talking movies notice how they never called them look whos talented and the 1991 bomb shout which was bad enough to make most people scream,positive
but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again,positive
weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again while barry robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straighttothecutoutbin album aptly named size isnt everything and of course they learned that sales are everything,positive
but now travoltas back on the hollywood scene once again and i think we all know why,positive
four words contract with the devil,positive
and this has nothing to do with newt gingrichs contract with america,positive
no satan is much more humane,positive
anyway yes travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld,positive
how do i know,positive
i own the document in question,positive
amazing what you can buy at those collectors shops for a few hundred dollars isnt it,positive
get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction with travolta as crime minion chili palmer,positive
he goes to collect some of the mafias money from a bgrade director gene hackman and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game,positive
sure a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood but i guess thats beside the point,positive
palmer is determined to get hackmans next project made so he sets out to convince big star martin weir danny devito to star in the movie bringing along downandout horror actress karen flores rene russo who has already had affairs with hackman and devito,positive
it doesnt take a las vegas oddsmaker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well after the customary sexual tension and denial which has been used in every comedy from whos the boss,positive
to speechless,positive
it works in this case unlike whos the boss,positive
although its interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also,positive
complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackmans other films and want in on this one too along with travoltas mob boss trying to track him down for defecting,positive
get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction despite the obvious similarities,positive
this movie doesnt have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year yes even better than halloween vi,positive
get shorty is my kind of movie one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence,positive
im definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on,positive
are you getting this shorty,positive
gere willis poitier chase each other around the world,positive
the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman,positive
when the soviet union imploded the western countries lost their shadow,positive
with the united states friendly with the russians we no longer had an entity to blame for the worlds problems,positive
this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy,positive
its time to rejoice because weve found our new villain,positive
now its no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands its the russian mafia,positive
a perfect solution it combines the dread of organized crime and the stillpresent uneasiness with the former eastern block countries,positive
best of all the villains are still foreigners fear of the other always plays best,positive
so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal bruce willis to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid,positive
the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone theyre not sure even exists,positive
coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen richard gere who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston sidney poitier and russian major valentina koslova diane venora,positive
mulqueens exgirlfriend basque terrorist isabella mathilda may is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal,positive
presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met,positive
the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his 70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesnt slip away,positive
crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his minivan the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers,positive
being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller the day of the jackal comparison between the two films is inevitable,positive
there is no doubt that the original is the better movie playing the story for suspense rather than the current,positive
as a mystery the jackal has enough holes in it to ruin the tale but if you can accept it for what it is theres entertainment to be had,positive
holes lets see a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up,positive
for a 20year veteran that can command the big bucks the jackal is an incredibly poor shot,positive
the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police but its just the two of them,positive
willis disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmers in the saint,positive
and lest you misunderstand thats not a compliment,positive
but the three stars are fun to watch,positive
its good to see gere in something other than a business suit,positive
willis has a mixed history in picking projects but his characters are always watchable,positive
poitier is by far the superior actor but has limited screen time,positive
the problems in logic are flaws but dont ruin the experience,positive
occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes,positive
this is one of them,positive
the appeared in the 112097 bloomington voice bloomington indiana,positive
seen may 31 1999 on home video rented,positive
one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise,positive
with some films it might be just a secondary issue but with dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifullyconstructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie,positive
theres an old roleplaying computer game called d ja v wherein the player takes on the role of a man who cant remember who he is where he is and how he got there,positive
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict,positive
the premise to this film is not unlike that game only this time we dont have control over the protagonist,positive
we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually its more than just the city its the whole reality that isnt just that neogothic look a la batman blade runner but is so fully developed its almost a different genre completely,positive
later he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he has no idea whats going on other than the fact something is not right,positive
the fact theres a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling,positive
this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre horrific tone,positive
the man doesnt know who he is nor where hes going and its interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him,positive
in fact this is the way all stories begin since its impossible to know the history of a character their feelings values morals etc until after weve observed them for a while,positive
but in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story,positive
eventually some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police,positive
we met inspector frank bumstead hurt a quiet unemotional softspoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time,positive
two other important characters are also introduced dr daniel p schreber sutherland a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be johns doctor and emma murdoch connelly a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old filmnoir movies,positive
it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film,positive
he also contacts emma which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex mysterious back story,positive
but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in dark city which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo,positive
everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot its lighting art direction and overall production design they dont seem to be able to afford any gratuities,positive
however that might also be whats keeping it from reaching its maximum potential,positive
by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come to realize that its all a hoax,positive
everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction,positive
but as the films tagline says last night one of us went off,positive
for reasons that are never clearly explained it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive a process known as tuning,positive
the aliens which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight,positive
at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then,positive
this premise certainly is interesting and director and coscreenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard,positive
he does provide some explanations such as that dr schreber is an assistant to the strangers because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form,positive
the aliens mix and match the memories of the citys population to see who will change and who will not,positive
in the process this creates for a good deal of deep thoughtprovoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world,positive
however where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is,positive
the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant static and cold mediocre performances by hurt and connelly dont help either,positive
for example john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her yet in some scenes crucial to the films plot we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other which is also part of the films climax and ending,positive
and thats what proyas seems to be inferring with the film but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense,positive
ironically this is what made his first film the crow work so well which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical dark twisted world,positive
with dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message,positive
still the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable,positive
theres a lot to like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does,positive
the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years,positive
dark city is what the movies are all about the escape from the real world,positive
sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest,positive
some people call it original or artsy or abstract,positive
some people simply call it trash,positive
a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings,positive
definitely a generationx aimed movie a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaokebased musical dream sequence,positive
whew,positive
anyone in their 30s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film,positive
its somewhat silly its somewhat outrageous and its definitely not your typical romance story but for the right audience it works,positive
a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting,positive
well sorry folks but i havent seen trainspotting so i cant really compare,positive
whether that works in this films favor or not is beyond me,positive
but i do know this ewan mcgregor whom i had never had the pleasure of watching definitely charmed me,positive
he was great,positive
cameron diazs character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp,positive
the audience may find it difficult to care about her thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him,positive
misguided,positive
you bet,positive
loveable,positive
you bet,positive
a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city utah,positive
this was just one more thing i didnt know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke,positive
maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise but i think even if i had known i would have been just as happy,positive
a life less ordinary is quirky eccentric and downright charming,positive
not for everyone but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies,positive
it is an understood passion and an understood calm,positive
bud white walks into the home of lynn bracken a prostitute cut to look like veronica lake,positive
hes one of l a s finest investigating the murder of fellow cop and one of the leads takes him to her home,positive
its understood that he is quiet thunder a guy whos calm voice is more powerful than his arms,positive
its understood that shes supposed to be beautiful but underneath her face is pain and scraped out lines that say her life could have been so much more,positive
you know without having to be told,positive
youre the first guy who hasnt told me i look like veronicca lake in under a minute she says,positive
you look ten times better,positive
he says it without thinking,positive
like he knows without her having to say anything,positive
whites face doesnt turn it doesnt blush,positive
you see his eyes and you believe him,positive
its a perfect moment in a near perfect movie,positive
l a confidential is the best movie of the year,positive
it is grace and poetry a richly layered work of pure entertainment,positive
it is a portrait of police and morality as it works its way through characters that are so real on screen that you believe that they might have a soul,positive
in a phrase it is everything,positive
it is funny it is exciting has enough action and adventure and mystery and grace and suspense,positive
it is the pinnacle of a movie a complete work a flawless film,positive
its hard to tell you about the plot because its about so much more than plot,positive
besides theres too much to describe,positive
sure its about police and searching for corruption and who fights for the right reasons and the definition of justice,positive
but its also about what you feel when you look into the eyes of the characters in the film,positive
director curtis hanson has perfectly framed each character letting you see into them rooting for them one moment doubting them the next,positive
the actors work with their lines but in this movie their most important weapon is their eyes,positive
you can tell what each person is feeling just by looking into their eyes for one moment,positive
russell crowe plays bud white a muscle cop with a beef for wife beaters,positive
his movements are fierce,positive
when he strikes you jump when hes calm you know it wont be for long,positive
his intensity oozes out of the screen,positive
you follow his character through the movie afraid of him but in sympathy of him because you know how good his heart is,positive
hes looking for a way to solve crimes youre just never sure how hes going to do it,positive
his counter is ed exley played with a chisselled face by guy pierce,positive
you feel for him for his character because of all the cops in the movie hes the one thats actually trying to do the right thing by going by the book,positive
you know that he must face the reality of breaking the book and you love the way he gets there,positive
ive seen l a confidential twice immediately after it was over i wanted to hit the rewind button and watch it again,positive
i didnt want the theater experience to end,positive
its been a long time since i actually experienced a movie feeling like i got something after i walked out,positive
thats why i love movies the great ones can be too rich and powerful to describe,positive
watch l a confidential after you leave the theater you feel like you just watched a classic movie,positive
thats why la confidential stands as the best movie of the year,positive
l a confidential directed by curtis hanson,positive
starring russell crowe guy pierce kevin spacey james cromwell and kim basinger,positive
capsule the best place to start if youre a jackie chan newcomer,positive
roars along never stops for breath and frequently hilarious,positive
to talk about jackie chan as a stuntman is to miss a million things,positive
jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today but also a very funny guy,positive
he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger used to make me laugh hes funny just standing there copping a look,positive
supercop has jackie making us laugh scream duck root and gasp for breath often all in the same scene,positive
its actually the third in a loosely related series of movies each with jackie playing kevin chan a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neckdeep into trouble and then karatekicking his way out of it,positive
the others are also worth seeing,positive
its a little slow to start but once it gets moving its a field day,positive
the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind,positive
kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china which requires him to collaborate with the attractive and asskicking chief fo chinese security played here by the everenjoyable michelle yeoh,positive
theres a fun chemistry between the two of them especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform,positive
kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail all undercover of course and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss,positive
the drug boss however has problems of his own his wifes on trial for many of his own crimes and shes got the key to an account with all of his drug funds,positive
this means of course endless trouble not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while hes out in the field and she sees him with this other woman and but thats one of the movies unique pleasures the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly,positive
action there is of course nonstop action in this movie everything from oneonone kung fu to allout gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines,positive
outrunning the hong kong coast guard,positive
there is also a virtuoso climax which features among other things jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter a wrongway freeway chase which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the copter as well as a motorcycle,positive
you get the idea,positive
this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food quick enjoyable filling,positive
watch it with friends,positive
when they stop making movies like this the world will be a tad greyer,positive
i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years,positive
it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood,positive
but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex,positive
yes more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster,positive
for all teenagers its almost like a rite of passage,positive
and what we did was sometimes downright nasty sometimes funny and sometimes shocking,positive
and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer,positive
american pie is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year,positive
just how great are their hormones raging,positive
one of them notes after watching disneys the little mermaid that ariel is soooo hot,positive
the four schoolmates are kevin oz finch and jim,positive
kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend but doesnt want to have sex until the time is just right,positive
but what is the perfect time,positive
there is just no way to know and that frightens him,positive
oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive,positive
he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages,positive
finch is the phobic hermit who doesnt stand a chance with any girl,positive
so he pays someone 200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess,positive
suddenly girls are lining up to go out with him,positive
but among these friends it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful,positive
when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student his inexperience comes shining through,positive
he has much to learn and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge,positive
this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with moms apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking raunchy yet unbelievably funny,positive
the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its r rating,positive
there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that theres something about mary was gloriously ribald,positive
in fact at first this film received a sinful nc17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teenaccessible rating,positive
but i guess after seeing the noholdsbarred coarseness of south park this seems tame by comparison,positive
teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest,positive
but unlike many teen sex comedies there is a genuine intelligence at work here,positive
these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex,positive
their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences,positive
they know what they want yet temper it with responsibility,positive
but almost always its impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster and its these episodes that make american pie such a carnal delight to watch,positive
the second jackalbased film to come out in 1997 the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland and is directed by a man who hailed from joblos own alma matter concordia university in montreal canada,positive
the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal but does not pretend to be 100 factual,positive
plot naval officer ramirez quinn gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal in order to put an end to the actual militants radical activities,positive
he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee,positive
ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this assignment and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism intrigue and doublepersonality syndrome which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states,positive
critique great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to twohour runtime,positive
admittedly i wasnt a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film and didnt expect much from this movie beforehand but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line,positive
the first hour is mostly just a buildup of things to come and does offer a great characterization of the jackal but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending,positive
quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal but didnt offer anything extraordinary in my opinion,positive
sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that theyve played in both of their respective careers of late but nonetheless appeared to relish the coldheartedness of their chosen characters,positive
i didnt like performance put forth from quinns wife in this flick but then again she doesnt show up in most of the film so that wasnt so bad,positive
i did however enjoy director duguays interesting style and cinematic vision,positive
this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer,positive
i thought that was neat,positive
having said that i didnt think the first hour needed to be as long as it was and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the fake jackal met with the real jackals girlfriend without much retrospection on her part but all in all not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre,positive
little known facts ben kingsleys real name is krishna banji he stands 5 8 was born in scarborough england and won the best actor honor in 1982s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi,positive
many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal canada joblos haven of restfulness,positive
donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland is canadian and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal,positive
us critictype people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies arent thrill rides but i think that back to the future ii is one of the few exceptions,positive
if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s then this has the spirit of the 80s full of fights chase scenes cliff hangers special effects some detective work and of course the vision of the hightech future,positive
the film picks up exactly where the first film left off with doc lloyd marty fox and jennifer elizabeth shue travelling 30 years into the future because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifers kids,positive
doc tells marty he must take his sons place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr says yes to griff wilson in one of four different roles,positive
whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasnt joking especially when it comes to the movies,positive
essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 but its not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself,positive
at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better and it seems like everythings copasetic right,positive
wrong,positive
since when do things go according to plan in the back to the future movies,positive
there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i wont even bother to list them all,positive
basically we get to see marty as an old man his house his family etc we also go back to an alternate 1985 and then back again to 1955 with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath,positive
the films best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle,positive
its difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail,positive
the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense,positive
instead of a grand finale we get lots of little victories,positive
by the end everything is back to normal but something happens that leads to yet another sequel but it doesnt seem gratuitous,positive
back to the future part ii is a really great adventure movie,positive
it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor,positive
if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child would you do it,positive
gattaca is a film which presents a future where society has answered yes to this question but then ponders if this was actually the right decision,positive
gattaca came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature the lovable dolly the sheep and with this in mind the film only becomes more frightening,positive
the way the realm of genetics is heading it may only take a couple decades until the future gattaca presents becomes true,positive
contrary to the misleading trailers gattaca is not a scifi thriller in the way that theres lots of murder hitchcockian suspense and chase scenes,positive
this is a quiet sad film about intelligent theories,positive
in fact the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley the latter whos novel brave new world featured genetically engineered children,positive
its a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia which is exactly what gattaca presents and the main reason i dug it so much,positive
the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ethan hawke a man with high hopes but a 90 chance of heart problems and a prospected life span of around 30 years,positive
as a child he was put down because of the threats of genetics while his younger genetically perfect brother anton loren dean was promised whatever his heart desired,positive
vincent yearns to be an astronaut but when he gets a job at a giant space company its as a janitor ernest borgnine plays his boss,positive
but one day he finds out that its probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist or something german wings tony shalhoub who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in 97 men in black a life less ordinary whos client is a genetically perfect man jerome morrow jude law who has unfortunately been crippled,positive
fortunately though theres no record of the accident and hes willing to give someone else his life,positive
since vincent looks a bit like him,positive
after a couple alterations some minor some really major he has donned the life of jerome and is doing his job,positive
there he meets a genetically imperfect woman irene uma thurman whos genetically perfect in real life anyway hee hee and the two begin a kind of relationship albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a mans stats are,positive
however a murder of a highlevel worker at his office is killed and one of s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semiwily inspector hugo alan arkin and none other than vincents long lost brother anton who hasnt seen him since they were teenagers,positive
we know didnt do it but with his older picture being posted everywhere not only s in trouble but also the real jerome whos as much in it as he is,positive
however there isnt many big suspense set pieces which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in the film would lose its message and descend into just being a scifi thriller a la william gibson,positive
the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin,positive
while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening there are no big distractions from the point of the film much to the dismay of commercial audiences,positive
what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created,positive
irene has no real spunk in her life and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people,positive
and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man claiming that his accident was really no accident,positive
what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that and the ending is shocking as its a definite work of dystopian propaganda but doesnt have the down ending of other works of this kind,positive
the production design of this film is probably the best ive seen this year its stunning very pleasing to the eye but still very cold,positive
since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery,positive
and the sequence of all the highlevel workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliamesque feel to it showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombielike life,positive
the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy,positive
the acting from everyone is great with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway interesting pointless fact uma and ethan started dating after this film and currently she is pregnant with his child,positive
but the best performance belongs to jude law who steals every scene hes in and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden,positive
i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something im not sure of,positive
gattaca warns us not to go any farther chiefly because well create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are,positive
and when i see a possible future featuring a 12fingered piano player well folks that just creeps me out,positive
the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients a witty and whimsical script inspired performances a great sense of humor a large and wonderful cast and the beautiful scenery of vancouver,positive
its a movie of weddings marriage family infidelity andoh yeslove,positive
like 3 men and a baby cousins is an americanized version of a french film 1975s cousin cousine,positive
the plot is complicated but it goes something like this,positive
larry and tom are cousins each of whom is notsohappilymarried,positive
tom starts an affair with larrys wife tish and to get even larry and toms wife maria pretend to have an affair of their own,positive
soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running,positive
cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures,positive
the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role and virtually every performance deserves mention,positive
ted danson in his first starring film role finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity,positive
while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on cheers he is also complex and vulnerable with more between his ears than empty space,positive
as maria isabella rossellini is a joy to watch she is shy sensuous and immensely alluring,positive
sean young is perfectly cast as larrys picture perfect wife tish a superficial and trendy makeup consultant,positive
keith coogan from adventures in babysitting is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larrys rebellious son mitch,positive
and finally lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitchs rambunctious grandfather he provides some of cousins best lines and laughs,positive
like moonstruck cousins is a mix of drama and comedy,positive
the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd,positive
it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and hearttug,positive
how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other as friends and as lovers,positive
well to its credit cousins is just such a movie,positive
lets hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins,positive
pleasantville 1998 taps into hollywoods lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed,positive
www pleasantville com april 2 1999 friday,positive
cast tobey maguire reese witherspoon william h macy joan allen j t,positive
walsh jeff daniels,positive
mpaa rating pg13 for sexual content and thematic elements,positive
genre drama,positive
in my opinion,positive
in short it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film one can easily be misled as to what the real message is,positive
review in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life such as rain fire or emotions,positive
the town of pleasantville has one adjective pleasant,positive
there is no sadness no fear no danger no discomfort no love and no hate,positive
put simply its a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for,positive
j one big note however is that it is only a 50s sitcom that airs in reruns on an oldies tv station or is it,positive
i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed,positive
i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office,positive
but it wasnt until months later when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy dollar theaters after not having seen it for so long that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced,positive
it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some healthy immorality is not a world at all,positive
instead the actual message which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of is that a world without immorality doesnt give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself because everything is automatically right,positive
there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made no space for growth and never anything new to learn and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story,positive
now im not saying thats necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be,positive
besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch,positive
the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable,positive
after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white its hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more,positive
a truly intelligent addition to it all however is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork,positive
that said the plot goes as such,positive
david and jennifer are two very 90s high school twins with the typical relationship outline of dontmesswithmylifeandiwontmesswithyours,positive
they demonstrate the wellknown teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today,positive
david is the shyer subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv while jennifer is the wild licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation,positive
but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home,positive
nevertheless jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed,positive
and as said earlier not to flip the town around into some corrupt society but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them,positive
not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place,positive
people got hurt,positive
they cried,positive
they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves and thats when their physical world turned colors as well,positive
this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie but to me the message is finally clear,positive
i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run well never know what we could have done better,positive
until the next great movie i see i remain sincerely danielle flynn imr,positive
national lampoons animal house made in 1978 and set in 1962 remains one of the no fuck that noise the funniest movie ever made,positive
and this isnt just my opinion either everybody knows this and thats why about a gazillion inferior ripoffs have been made trying to duplicate its success,positive
pcu anyone,positive
and the first person to bring up glory daze gets decked,positive
animal house takes place at the fictional faber college circa 1962 where the omega frat calls the shots,positive
these guys are wholesome cleancut modelcitizens,positive
i e,positive
a bunch of assholes,positive
greg their leader is going out with mandy pepperidge but since the silly bastard doesnt believe in premarital sex their relationship never goes further than a quick jackoff under the stars,positive
neidermeyer is the supremebozo of the bunch walking around with his dick out kicking freshman ass and trying to impress the muff,positive
also hanging around these losers is babs future universal studios employee and serious bitch,positive
now lets just take a peak next door at the delta house,positive
over here anything goes you wanna throw shit out the window,positive
okay,positive
you wanna crush a bunch of beer cans on your forehead and pour honeymustard all over your chest,positive
go right ahead,positive
the frats leaders are otter and boon tim matheson and peter riegert,positive
otter is the ladies man going out with another girl every night and boon is the comedian,positive

the kind of guy who puts a creamfilled snowball into his mouth puffs up his cheeks and spits it out and then says im a zit get it,positive
the story is as follows the omegas are getting the deltas kicked off campus,positive
the deltas knowing that fighting the omegas is stupid decide to go out with style throwing a wild toga party and ruining the homecoming parade,positive
this is the fucnniest movie int he history of the world,positive
do yourself a favor and go see it,positive
after being hypnotized a man believes there is a ghost in his house,positive
the review,positive
two lowkey summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year the blair witch project and the sixth sense,positive
each has made well over 100 million in north america based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising,positive
if a films box office take were based primarily on its quality stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected for it is as scary if not scarier than the other two,positive
david koepp has given artisan entertainment the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit,positive
the story gets going after tom witzky bacon an average bluecollar dad gets hypnotized by his wife maggies erbe sister lisa douglas at a party,positive
while the hypnosis goes as expected to the partygoers it triggers something in toms head,positive
things begin to change around him blinking red lights let off a strange hum for example and he fights to stay in control of his own senses,positive
where these experiences take tom maggie and their son jake cope who tom thinks might have some answers is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you,positive
david koepp keeps the action localized the majority of the action takes place at toms house or just down the street,positive
by keeping things at home koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc,positive
unfortunately the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity,positive
humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting,positive
several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes,positive
also there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved though to mention them would be to give too much away,positive
kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably,positive
his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable as are the reactions from his wife maggie,positive
kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most wife who can no longer handle her husband parts,positive
while it is still a supporting role her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls a private club that im not invited to where they whisper about things all day long,positive
as jake zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense but gets less screen time,positive
both children manage the same trick making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are,positive
fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes,positive
it combines the dread of blair a creepy closedin feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast specifically bacon to give the fall its first genuine scary film,positive
if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more this could have been one of the years best,positive
the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now it mu5t be found,positive
so what exactly is the fifth element,positive
after seeing luc bessons ambitious muchshroudedinsecrecy science fiction fantasy i could not help but be let down by the actual answer which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think,positive
but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films docreate a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen,positive
the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wrapsthe actual storylineis the most conventional dismayingly so element pun intended of the film,positive
speaking in the vaguest possible terms the basics of the plot are as follows in the year 2259 a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth and only the four elementsearth wind fire and waterunited with a fifth element can stop it,positive
figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas bruce willis a shady southerndrawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg the hilariously hammy gary oldman picking up where he left off in bessons the professional a priest ian holm and a mysterious creature named leeloo milla jovovich,positive
all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelmingand unsurprisingfashion but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest,positive
what remains interesting and exciting however after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil director of photography thierry arbogast visual effects supervisor mark stetson and the crew at digital domain,positive
the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last,positive
the frenzied cityscape of new york with its vibrant dayglo colors tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds and the swarm of cars cabs and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways is absolutely breathtaking to behold especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film,positive
but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings werent equally as interesting and are they ever,positive
in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world from bulky robots to doglike mangalores the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jeanpaul gaulthier best known for creating madonnas pointy bustier getup in her blonde ambition tour,positive
gaulthiers outlandish creations such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps feel more at home in bessons futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film,positive
while bessons bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience,positive
for all its imagination certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre,positive
i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film ruby rhod chris tucker a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservativehe makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed,positive
at first this characters hyper energy is funny but the act wears out its welcome very quickly,positive
not irritating but just as strange is a musical number by blueskinned alien chanteuse diva maiwenn lebesco who singsand dancesan aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno,positive
the tune as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serras innovative score is haunting but it is also completely jarring,positive
then there are the campy touches of humor besson and coscripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout which too often are silly and forced a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny to boot,positive
the storys weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element,positive
while still visually and aurally spectacular the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be,positive
the big serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward,positive
as such at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters,positive
this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself who told me in the lobby following the screening imagine that the filmmaker watching the film with the enemy the critics that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second halfnow titled mr shadowis still waiting to be made,positive
still despite the story problems the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson rarely does a filmmakers original vision come to the screen in all its audacious undiluted glory,positive
it is a fascinating example of how of one artists fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams,positive
close your eyes for a moment if you will and imagine the sound of stephen reas gaelic brogue silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness,positive
a lackadaisical naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols,positive
an acerbic singsong metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess a clockwork orange,positive
a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile like those out of delicatessen or the tin drum,positive
imagine all of that and youll get a good sense of what you can expect from the butcher boy,positive
imagine that and more,positive
neil jordans latest film stars rea in more ways than one,positive
rea the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordans the crying game contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s,positive
but its his walltowall narration as the butcher boy of the title da bradys son francis that makes reas performance worth watching worth listening to,positive
and thats only half the fun,positive
playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is without a doubt a revelation,positive
for as much as reas voiceover permeates almost every scene of the butcher boy owens commands virtually every frame,positive
its impossible to take your eyes off him,positive
with his crop of carrotcolored hair ruddy complexion and overall grubby appearance francie brady is an unlikely hero refusing to be done in by his alcoholic trumpetplaying father his depressive suicidal mother or the neighboring bespectacled monster known as mrs nugent fiona shaw,positive
in fact everything was ok until the nugent came to town,positive
now she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe alan boyle as the looming commie menace the butcher boy is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many,positive
pigs screams mrs nugent at the brady menagerie,positive
youre all pigs,positive
its the start of many a related image,positive
after ma brady is shipped off to the garage for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians the lone ranger and other comicbook characters,positive
squealing like a stuck pig francie does the likes o that on the nugents living room floor and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for boney arsed bogmen where his ever fertile imaginationand clever chicaneryrunneth over,positive
director jordans vivid treatment of pat mccabes nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing dark comedy littered with surreal touches such as sin ad oconnor playing the virgin mary,positive
its not as outlandish as the trailers make out instead this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys schoolboy chums in real life allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior,positive
its bleak and its black but its fundamentally very funny,positive
rea talks us through it beautifully and owens drags us though it admirably and in tandem with jordans sure hand theirs are contributions to make the butcher boy a film worth savoring,positive
love is the devil is a challenging film munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artists psyche rather than the artists lifeline,positive
watching it i was enthralled with the look of the film the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre personalized filter,positive
everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon the films subject looked at it personally,positive
but while i was engrossed i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film awakened from my trance by some inner distraction and began to try and follow whats going on,positive
exactly what was i looking at,positive
watching this film i wasnt sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous,positive
directed and written by john maybury love is the devil is stylish masterpiece for the senses,positive
everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing,positive
the camera angles are ferociously askew and the closeups are uncomfortably too close,positive
the editing is deft occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs or rather intruders to bacons world and psyche,positive
as such there is no real story,positive
ive not heard much about francis bacon that i didnt read prior to the film but what i learned was this he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like,positive
he was one of the first to really come out of the closet and in interviews he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty,positive
as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi hes like a foppish and selfabsorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero,positive
he lives life the way he wants to live it to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him,positive
its as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself champagne for my real friends and pain for my sham friends he says one night at the bar he frequents,positive
love is the devil chronicles the latter part of his life,positive
bacon wellknown in his midlife awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor,positive
he walks in unafraid of what he finds and discovers a thief george dyer daniel craig,positive
bacon gives him an offer if he spends the night with him he can take anything he wants in the morning,positive
george agrees to this and off to bed he goes but ends up staying with him for whatever reason,positive
the film shows their lives together at least in reference to one another,positive
while creating bacons world of friends like high art this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant,positive
bacon is haughty and bizarre george is simple and doesnt understand bacon in the least especially not his paintings,positive
while watching this thats basically all i thought was there,positive
the film has a hypnotic feel free of any restraints of form and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about,positive
once the film is over its easier to piece it together,positive
i kept on thinking about this film wondering what the point to all of it was,positive
someone doesnt merely make a film of all style and no substance at all and if they do they do it by accident but still allow some substance to creep in,positive
thinking about it i remembered how the two fed off of eachother,positive
i thought about how bacon was a masochist in love with cruelty in one scene he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxers head splashes across his face in another scene he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisensteins battleship potemkin and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain,positive
he drove him over the edge and for him that was love even if it wasnt for george,positive
i guess that explains the title,positive
a bit,positive
thats great and all but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning,positive
i wish it hadnt reduced itself to making some point about humanity about how love is the most selfish thing in the world and it is if you look at it a certain way,positive
or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one mans twisted pysche,positive
its almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one mans uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audiences throat,positive
that way you dont reduce your film to something its just not,positive
i cant say i totally enjoyed love is the devil though,positive
despite all of the things i respect about this movie its still rather uncomfortable to sit through,positive
even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through especially after an exhausting first hour,positive
though hypnotic it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times as if it were taking advantage of one mans truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it,positive
as such i respect the way the film looks,positive
its beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that along with what dreams may come and dark city its the years most visually stunning film,positive
in fact if a better script had been forged id almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever,positive
and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs,positive
i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance,positive
then i would have had something to hold me over even now,positive
no man is an island one character quotes john donne in apt pupil effectively summarizing the movies themes,positive
while hardly a great film singers ambitious adaptation of kings short story is challenging nonetheless perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it,positive
apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses,positive
1984 wonderbred high school honours student todd bowden renfro conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again,positive
bowden suspects arthur denker mckellan the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby is actually a pseudonymous dussandermuch research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todds theory,positive
bowden strikes a deal with dussander in exchange for not revealing his identity dussander must satisfy bowdens intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view,positive
the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams but like a bystander at a traffic accident todds desire for gory details overrides his repulsion,positive
bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii,positive
marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his student among other things,positive
bowden who has taken on very hateful qualities he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook engages the veteran in an endless game of oneupmanship,positive
dussander stands to lose his freedom and bowden his credibilityin effect his postsecondary school future,positive
all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable and unsettling conclusion one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source materials excessive climax,positive
singer has yet to get keyser s ze out of his system,positive
his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence verbals tics and todds goldenboy reputation are plausible ruses they showcase morally bankrupt antiheroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals,positive
apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcomethere was no way you could see the ending coming as it was all a hoodwink anyway,positive
thankfully singer has gotten most of the usual suspects filmschoolish geek theatrics out of his system,positive
some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected obvious the dream sequences were extraneous but the majority of the film is subduedand singers handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murdererintraining,positive
mckellans and renfros performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellans finelytuned realization id like to single out renfros daring work,positive
he isnt afraid to play someone largely unappealing and coldhearted he strips his character of vanity something many of his peers wouldnt do,positive
can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylorthomas in the same role,positive
renfro was recently charged with possession of cocainei hope he doesnt continue down that path because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him,positive
as guidance counsellor edward french friend schwimmer also deserves mention,positive
he wants to be the parent to todd that todds own welltodo folks are not todd like most modern kidsand onlychildrenhas mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger and his sincerity makes the apt pupils blackeningheart even more apparent,positive
but one of the films ultimate questions are we born evil or do we learn evil might be answered in french whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous,positive
no man is an island indeedwe all have the capacity to make the right or the wrong choices,positive
schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible,positive
october 1998,positive
the excellent collection kings stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil but the shawshank redemption originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption and stand by me originally titled the body,positive
eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career,positive
known for his notorious late 80s slump murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years,positive
with the exception of the dreadful holy man he appears to be on pace for a fullfledged comeback,positive
life was a great move on the part of murphy and costar martin lawrence because its a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slapsticky drivel,positive
director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own and doesnt insert a distracting plot to back them up,positive
life is in a sense one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other,positive
amazingly the scale never tips in eithers favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other,positive
as the movie opens were introduced to ray gibson eddie murphy a twotiming pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club,positive
there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks martin lawrence,positive
somehow after multiple contrivances the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run,positive
when all is said and done ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff,positive
hence the setting of life mississippi state prison where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important and become set on finding an foolproof escape plan,positive
the film takes us from the 30s all the way to the 90s presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude,positive
luckily rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic academy award caliber manner,positive
not only do we believe the characters look as if theyre 90 years old but they sound like it too,positive
murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards,positive
this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up its sleeve,positive
while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at its core,positive
but the comedic aspects work wonderfully wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars,positive
the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama but in both senses its an overwhelming delight,positive
i could say a few bad things about the movie but i dont want to,positive
its such a nice surprise such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll,positive
have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally at any given moment in life,positive
or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world or outside of it,positive
these thoughtprovoking questions are the subject of final destination which is the most riveting horrordrama since 1999s the sixth sense,positive
stylishly filmed and tautly directed by xfiles alum james wong the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters in accurately written teenspeak rather than overwrought highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldnt use all the while developing into a darkly foreboding severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the lesssuccessful but still suspenseful epilogue,positive
at the start of the film 17yearold high school senior alex browning devon sawa is about to leave with his 40student french class for a field trip to paris,positive
progressively getting a case of preflight jitters he spots several mysterious coincidences including the departure time being 9 25 the same as his september 25 birthday as well as hearing the john denver song rocky mountain high over the sound system in the airport bathroom,positive
john denver died in a plane crash alex grudgingly mutters to himself,positive
once seated alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff and after causing a ruckus onboard he as well as six other students and a teacher are thrown off,positive
arguing in the airport lobby alexs suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight killing all 300 passengers including the rest of their classmates,positive
as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode the fellow survivors whom he has saved treat him in varying manners,positive
carter kerr smith the hotshot jock holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate,positive
alexs best friend tod chad e donella wants to stand by him but cant because of his fearful parents,positive
the teacher mrs lewton kristen cloke is frightened by him believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker,positive
only outsider clear rivers ali larter who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alexs premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life,positive
that is only the setup of final destination and the less said about what follows the better,positive
suffice to say the film does indeed turn into a slasher film albeit one that is more thoughtful than most and replaces a knifewielding maniac for the neverseen granddaddy killer of them all the grim reaper itself,positive
the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes and final destination surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years,positive
graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner they manage to occasionally be so intense you dont know whether to shrink down in your seat tap your feet in nervousness or turn away,positive
devon sawa a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999s underseen slashercomedy idle hands is even more of a charismatic presence here,positive
the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival which he comes to believe he wasnt meant to do as well as the loss of the other passengers is superbly and subtly acted on his part,positive
one scene in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful,positive
ali larter 1999s varsity blues in the other central role is also effective as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish manthe exact opposite of her nowdeceased father,positive
the other roles are not as fully written and most remain rather onedimensional,positive
the movie is mainly sawas however and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles,positive
tony todd 1992s candyman as an arcane morgue attendant pops up for a fiveminute cameo but his appearance is rather supererogatory,positive
and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy,positive
ultimately what is so good about final destination is that within the confines of the slasher genre writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films,positive
if anything its safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again,positive

star trek first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina,positive
star trek first contact pg13 anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the evenodd pattern the evennumbered installments of the series are good while the oddnumbered ones are well notsogood,positive
the pattern continues with the new star trek first contact an energetic scifi adventure that coincidentally is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series,positive
in this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek the next generation television series captain jeanluc picard patrick stewart and the rest of the 24thcentury crew of the starship enterprisecommander will riker jonathan frakes who also directed android lt cmdr,positive
data brent spiner lt cmdr,positive
geordi laforge levar burton lt cmdr,positive
worf michael dorn dr beverly crusher gates mcfadden and counselor deanna troi marina sirtis travel back to 21stcentury earth while doing battle with the borg a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen alice krige,positive
the borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their racestarting with the earthorbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway alfre woodard,positive
this is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else but unfortunately it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d moore,positive
the other half of the titlefirst contactrefers to a subplot that takes place on 21stcentury earth where riker troi and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran james cromwell who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials,positive
while this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise,positive
not helping matters is the tiresome cochran character an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too onenote after a while,positive
in the end though the first contact subplot doesnt detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole,positive
the story is typical scifi fantasy but the conviction of the castmost notably the alwaysphenomenal stewartmakes you believe and care,positive
frakes making his feature directorial debut keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods even upping the violence a notch this is the first trek film to bear a pg13 rating to greater effect,positive
st fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing the middling star trek generations and it definitely shows on screenthe production design and especially visual and makeup effects are outstanding in particular those involving the borg queen,positive
braga and moores mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees and the rest the references to the borg storyline in the tv series the continuity with the previous film e g,positive
the ongoing saga of datas emotion chip and a fleeting star trek voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos,positive
paramount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm,positive
based on the entertaining success that is star trek first contact id say the studio has nothing to worry about at least not until this cast retires and the crew of the wan star trek deep space nine takes over,positive
the premise of the new teentargeted horror film final destination causes a recollection of a memorable simpsons halloween episode,positive
after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable timemachine,positive
after a trek into the cretaceous period homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world,positive
again and again homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it,positive
the characters of final destination have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence their design,positive
someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake,positive
that someone is death,positive
you see alex browning devon sawa and six others have cheated the grim reaper,positive
but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve,positive
for a high school excursion alexs french class is traveling to paris by airline transport,positive
alex tense and neurotic has a shocking premonition after boarding he sees the plane and every passenger on it spontaneously explode in midair,positive
in a panic of sheer lunacy alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft,positive
after a handful of others including one teacher follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane the unwitting survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky,positive
the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize,positive
but death wont be cheated so easily and one by one the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances,positive
the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi,positive
before i delve into the meat of the review id just like to confer,positive
is that one helluva premise or what,positive
final destination creepy beyond rational comprehension probably reads more like an unsettling xfiles episode than the simpsons therefore the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong,positive
on familiar turf the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong and the opening 20 minutes of final destination reflects that,positive
unlike most thrillers the setup is crisp and cool,positive
you just deeply sincerely hope that the momentum wont unspool leaving us with a secondstring effort with nothing but cheap derivative shocks,positive
young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration what with i know what you did last summer and sequel idle hands and a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil urban legend,positive
after the setup when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair i started to really have fun with final destination,positive
low and behold a teen thriller that is actually unsettling actually suspenseful and yes actually intelligent,positive
some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside this film is among the most refreshing and allout enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cuttingedge scream in 1996,positive
final destination stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the bloodspattered slasher crap weve endured throughout the past few years,positive
not that the characters are that good,positive
sawa is game as alex a connectthedots personality that we never fully comprehend,positive
in addition the survivors are endearing geek tod chad e donella jocky controlfreak carter kerr smith of dawsons creek carters ditzy girlfriend terry amanda detmer the nonetoosubtly named billy hitchcock seann william scott supplier of lukewarm comic relief and a lone teacher the emotionally delicate ms lewton kristin cloke,positive
aside from alex the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter varsity blues playing an abstract character named clear rivers what were her parents thinking,positive
the personality of clear is written with such a vague nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flashcard saying hello i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main characters plight,positive
toss a few stereotypical fbi agents daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith and a ummm,positive
spiritual mortician former candyman tony todd into the mix and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing dicing and assorted disembowelments,positive
not so,positive
final destination has no slicing and dicing or at least none dealt by a human killer and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening,positive
the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying murdererontheloose concept with assistance from a shrewd intelligently paced screenplay by morgan wong and jeffrey reddick,positive
the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity listen up reindeer games,positive
but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination is the murder scenes,positive
creative resourceful and breathlessly inventive the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a characters demise,positive
what will trigger the accident,positive
will it be the john denver record just put on to play rocky mountain high,positive
yeah sick humor,positive
will it be the leaking toilet,positive
the falling fishing reel in the corner,positive
the murders are startling and largely unforeseen including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward,positive
a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach,positive
it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes but who cares,positive
its fun,positive
in that simple regard final destination is my cup of tea,positive
this stylishly executed thriller although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side,positive
after the show it will also have an frightening impact on you,positive
when will your design expire,positive
is death waiting around the corner,positive
the final effect is a major case of the heebiejeebies,positive
most people fit into two different categories you either love woody allen or you hate his guts,positive
my family for the most part hates him and his movies,positive
i think hes very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years,positive
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of,positive
unrestrained by physical boundaries allens humor comes shining through,positive
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allens intelligent observations of life,positive
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one,positive
in 1995 a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something theyd never seen before,positive
toy story used stateoftheart computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present,positive
many critics will call that a better film but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture,positive
antz however has upped the ante considerably,positive
disneys a bugs life isnt due out for another two months and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal,positive
by beating disney out they have satisfied the audiences thirst for computeranimated films,positive
but dont let that fool you disney is definitely not scared,positive
in the past two years competitions have broken out between studios,positive
in 1997 it was the volcano duel,positive
in my opinion dantes peak came out way ahead of its predecessor both in time and in quality,positive
volcano had an original premise but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations,positive
in 1998 there are twice as many competing films,positive
first was the comet competition and armageddon blew away its cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact,positive
but now its even more interesting as one beloved studio disney goes up against the newcomer dreamworks,positive
who will prevail,positive
time will tell but im sure that mr mouse has nothing to fear,positive
this may sound like i didnt like antz on the contrary id put it up there with toy story,positive
but due to its pg rating many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldnt appear in disneys version,positive
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a familyoriented film,positive
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd,positive
the humor is also written especially for adults though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended,positive
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents,positive
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allens shtick and franz kafkas metamorphosis the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug,positive
z allen is a troubled ant believing he was not made to be a worker,positive
when youre the middle child in a family of five million he comments about his neglected childhood,positive
one night z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place in life,positive
in walks princess bala sharon stone whom no one recognizes without a crown,positive
bala asks z is he would like to dance and they engage in a pulp fictionesque dance while everyone else is following the leader,positive
after discovering that she is the princess z falls in love but theres a problem bala is getting married to general mandible gene hackman a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony,positive
in order to do that he must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest of the colony namely the worker ants,positive
but to get rid of the queen he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her,positive
he and colonel cutter christopher walkin come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle where they will surely be killed,positive
the queen is reluctant at first but decides it is best for the colony,positive
meanwhile z wants to meet bala again and he asks weaver an army ant to switch places with him,positive
so z gets sent off to battle but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites,positive
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers which contained a very similar sequence,positive
however antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time so the similarities are merely coincidence,positive
the second half of the film revolves around zs kidnapping of bala and their search for a mythical place called insectopia,positive
there an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants,positive
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension especially one involving a magnifying glass,positive
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day in fact im just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally,positive
the ants look up in awe and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground,positive
visually its an exciting rush of adrenaline,positive
but dont be fooled,positive
little kids shouldnt see this as they may just try and copy it,positive
after seeing antz i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again,positive
hopefully children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel,positive
as an animated film antz is probably the best you will find to date,positive
visually its as stunning as what dreams may come,positive
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters arent limited by gravity,positive
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible,positive
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball,positive
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball,positive
however the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boys shoe,positive
its truly a great example of film making at its finest,positive
with computer technology the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar to the actors providing the voices,positive
the best example would have to be barbatus danny glover,positive
at one point you can even see the pores on his face although i doubt ants have pores,positive
do they,positive
barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body,positive
young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head but a good deal of humor is derived more appropriate for adults of course,positive
disneys a bugs life looks good but i dont know if they will be able to best dreamworks newest animated feature in terms of animation,positive
if not then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do go head to head with the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia was good but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney,positive
vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature and antz has one of the best lineups seen since toy story,positive
in fact it far exceeds that one,positive
woody allen has always been funny but here he transcends most of what hes done in the past few years,positive
without a body his comic timing is the most noticeable thing,positive
in fact im pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines,positive
sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability though for the most part stone works best as a dramatic actress,positive
sylvester stallone teamed up with stone once again is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor not a typecast action star,positive
after a snub at the oscars last year stallone is proving himself as the serious or comedic as illustrated here actor that he is,positive
gene hackman is superb as the grufftalking general almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona,positive
christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns,positive
anne bancroft has a minimal role but shes effective nonetheless,positive
danny glover has a small role but he does a very very good job,positive
dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick eurotrash beesboth are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd,positive
jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver although most people wont recognize her voice either,positive
many people will recognize grant shauds voice as the foreman,positive
he played miles on the tv show murphy brown,positive
this is definitely a huge cast with some highprofile names and it will definitely help its grosses,positive
of course you can probably tell where a lot of the 60 million budget went to also,positive
directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers though guterman did direct a 1994 feature headless,positive
but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture,positive
tense at times and very funny throughout the two hold this film together like professionals,positive
the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults,positive
kids will delight in the animation while parents can laugh heartily at the humor,positive
most of it will go over young childrens heads,positive
does that mean you shouldnt take kids to see it,positive
not at all,positive
they will have a lot of fun watching this one,positive
what is great is the themes that are given to us,positive
part social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz gives everyone something to talk about whether it be the animation or the discussions of individualism and community,positive
thankfully its not subtle in either aspects,positive
antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action,positive
sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie but the violence is what should keep kids at home,positive
the battle scene has ants melting in acid and bugs being speared to death,positive
and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight,positive
but other than that and some sexual innuendos its a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters,positive
i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough but its still advisable to leave really young children at home,positive
have i confused you enough,positive
if you do take your kids i recommend seeing the film with them because more than likely youll enjoy it the most,positive
this christmas little ralphie parker peter billingsley wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree,positive
although cautioned by many that he will shoot his eye out ralphie remains optimistic conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers,positive
it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one,positive
a christmas story is a favorite among many during the holiday season and boy it is certainly easy to see why,positive
ralphies endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable,positive
evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things a christmas story does so well,positive
here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season,positive
1 period detail,positive
this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940s with loving detail,positive
shepard narrates from a first person pointofview divulging his various adventures one snowy december in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head,positive
shepards firsthand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious but also witty and warm with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing,positive
on top of that young billingsleys stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration,positive
director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality,positive
i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like,positive
2 mom and dad,positive
both melinda dillon as mom and darren mcgavin as the old man are perfect in their roles,positive
its hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured,positive
for instance he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues,positive
in portraying the writer as a persistent but mildmannered young lad peter billingsley has struck quite the chord,positive
his performance is richly textured making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment,positive
which brings us to,positive
3 the comic situations,positive
there are plenty of memorable moments in a christmas story,positive
moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing with so much more to explore and to cherish,positive
i am particularly partial of the fword scene in which ralphie blurts out the shocking fourletter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard,positive
again shepards method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry,positive
the numerous sequences that stick in ones mind include of course the famous department store santa scene in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree,positive
i could go on but ill finish on this note a christmas story is a standout among holiday movies because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes,positive
not only is it funny its often genuinely hilarious not to mention warm fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places,positive
i plan on making a christmas story a christmas tradition,positive
why dont you,positive
a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hiphop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why todays youth seem attracted to black culture,positive
the review,positive
if black white the new film from james toback is eventually remembered for only one thing it will be the revelation that brooke shields claudia schiffer marla maples and mike tyson can act,positive
however this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that,positive
black white is a fascinating film it makes a statement about americas youth and hiphop culture without getting heavyhanded overly serious,positive
featuring a cast of known commodities ben stiller robert downey jr and hot newcomers singers bijou phillips tobacks is a complex film worth seeing,positive
black white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other a la robert altman,positive
there is dean the basketball player allan houston who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear stiller in exchange for fifty grand a game,positive
this eventually spills over into the life of deans longtime friend rich power a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem,positive
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a whiteowned club on his turf,positive
meanwhile the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager shields and her gay husband terry downey jr,positive
others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will joe pantoliano as his district attorney father jared leto as a high school teacher marla maples as the mother of one of hiphop crazed teens claudia schiffer as deans girlfriend and mike tyson as,positive
mike tyson,positive
the stories ebb and flow through the film losing and gaining prominence over time,positive
friendships are lost lovers are gained and there is an occasional burst of violence,positive
originally rated nc17 in the united states black white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls,positive
while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing,positive
the threeway sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for and several audience members got up and left at that point,positive
the frequent sex is one of the films few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film,positive
to tobacks credit the level of violence in black white is almost nil,positive
these gangstas and hiphop artists are given real problems and concerns and only become guntoting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way,positive
whenever a character finds himself on donagers handheld digital camera he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence but not everyone has fully bought into the idea,positive
charlie phillips is full of bluster about why she loves hiphop but admits that in ten years time ill be way over this,positive
these youth know they are going through a phase and are simply enjoying it,positive
toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny,positive
most of the humour comes from mike tyson who provides the films comic relief without really trying,positive
he is given big words like vernacular to say and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better playing on tysons image as a dimwit,positive
but tyson also gets the films scariest moment,positive
as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm,positive
the scene is entirely improvised with downey jr being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction,positive
the reaction he gets being slapped and then choked is astonishing as downey jrs face turns a frightening shade of purple,positive
black white is a film about hiphop culture and the films omnipresent hiphop soundtrack strongly supports this,positive
but toback keeps things from becoming too serious by moving from story to story as quickly as he does toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one characters struggle,positive
thus black whites message about hiphop becomes secondary to the film itself,positive
toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hiphop along the way,positive
and we do,positive
i think that any competent member of the human race whos ever seen a movieany moviecould probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer,positive
even though i try very hard to not predict films as im watching them especially not romantic comedies the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds and sometimes minutes before i actually saw it happen on screen,positive
but i dont care,positive
not even a little,positive
my reasons for this are simple 1 adam sandler is great,positive
2 drew barrymore is great,positive
3 the movie is so funny,positive
there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard,positive
i havent laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers,positive
sandler plays robby hart a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music,positive
in the opening scenes he seems like a happygolucky wedding singer at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual steve buscemi who decides that his brothers wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life up to that point was utter pointlessness,positive
a week later at his own wedding he is left standing at the altar by his exfianc e linda angela featherstone,positive
with his life in complete disarray he meets julia barrymore a waitress,positive
she is engaged to glenn matthew glave and is to marry him in about three months,positive
julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans,positive
soon and predictably it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk and that robby and julia really love each other,positive
oh sure its trite,positive
and if anyone making this film expected us to like feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer then they truly underestimated their audience,positive
what makes the story bearable aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music are the performances,positive
barrymore is simply adorable here ive never seen her look so close to the way she did in et,positive
not only is she pleasant to look at but her acting job here really is a good oneand it doesnt hurt that the character is likable and adequately wellwritten,positive
and the jerk played in fullforce by graves is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy ive ever seen,positive
naturally the true star here is sandler,positive
i think the guy is flatout hilarious,positive
he can say something that just isnt funny and his delivery makes me laugh,positive
his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can indeed hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy,positive
whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler the wedding singer gives him a character that for the first time he actually has to fit into,positive
as far as im concerned he succeeded and this film is testimony that he does in fact have some range in his talents,positive
and the movie is just so funny,positive
perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc e abandoned him,positive
this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air,positive
and while the film like all romantic comedies takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half,positive
my formal complaints for the wedding singer arent very important,positive
the film is predicable but who cares,positive
the characters are extremely likable the movie is ridiculously funny and the experience is simply enjoyable,positive
in addition to this i cant imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film,positive
in that order i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review,positive
i just want everyone to know that i laughed,positive
a lot,positive
vannesa kensington austin do you smoke after sex austin powers i dont know baby ive never looked,positive
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season,positive
austin powers 2 the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity,positive
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place,positive
myers returns as the swinging 60s spy and his archnemesis the bald headed dr evil who is given much of the spotlight here,positive
theres an early scene in which dr evil and his son scott seth green appear on a jerry springer segment entitled my dad is evil and wants to take over the world hosted by springer himself,positive
most of these talkshow gags spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee are no longer as funny as they once were,positive
happily this is an exception especially when a fight breaks out between dr evil and the other guests,positive
sample dialogue come back here you mother,positive
you want a piece of me,positive
the audience was in stitches,positive
there are many good things about this sequel,positive
dr evil is now assisted by minime verne troyer a pintsized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry,positive
minime is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does pinkie and all,positive
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina evils loudmouth assassin sidekick and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber,positive
this works surprisingly well,positive
afterward theres even a meeting at the coffee machine where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment,positive
oh yes,positive
the plot,positive
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington elizabeth hurley that goes disastrously wrong powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr evil,positive
in the original the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods,positive
here its time travel,positive
dr evil has this crazy plan to steal austins mojo the source of his sexual powers so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber,positive
there he employs a grotesque 600pound scottish assassin named fat bastard also myers to commandeer the mojo so that our future hero is left completely shagless,positive
meanwhile austin is informed of evils wrongdoing by basil exposition michael york and is supplied with his very own timetraveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle,positive
once back in 1969 powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell heather graham and learns of dr evils plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon,positive
in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars evil calls the moon base a death star,positive
if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke its austin powers the spy who shagged me,positive
ap2 has many hilarious moments much more so than the original austin powers,positive
but what it doesnt have is the confident support system that the first boasted and the jokes are now more scattershot and hitandmiss,positive
while myers has a knack for delivering clever inspired gags he sometimes doesnt know when to call it quits,positive
the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa will ferrell and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner,positive
robert wagner as dr evils 2 man has only one scene early on in the film where he lacks all the focus of the character,positive
one nice surprise is rob lowe as the young 2 who patterns wagners voice and movements right down to a tee,positive
there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina,positive
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project and many bits are sidesplittingly funny,positive
dont miss an extended visual gag in a tent where the shadows leave much to the imagination,positive
of the new characters graham doesnt leave much of an impression,positive
her performance is merely okay and she lacks the gungho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her,positive
and as for fat bastard,positive
well he provides one or two hilarious moments but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far,positive
but my most severe complaint mr bigglesworth was only in one scene,positive
but with gritted teeth i managed to get over that,positive
this sequel will not leave fans disappointed its more often than not a laugh riot,positive
and i look optimistically to the future where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection,positive
if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas we should be in store for much more,positive
c 1999 jamey hughton,positive
jamey hughton 15 has written a weekly column in the starphoenix saskatoon sk since november 1997,positive
he was a 1999 writing finalist in the canadian ytv achievement awards,positive
well this is not mission difficult mr hunt its mission impossible,positive
difficult should be a walk in the park for you,positive
agent swanbeck sir anthony hopkins the series new agent phelps takes ethan hunt tom cruise down a notch,positive
a russian scientist rade serbedzija has created a new virus and its antidote called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection,positive
a rogue imf agent sean ambrose dougray scott wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause,positive
posing as ethan hunt ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do,positive
the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoffhall thandie newton to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods,positive
ethan and nyah fall quickly in love but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambroses,positive
reluctantly he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team,positive
ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah,positive
although the first mission impossible film was a moderate box office success audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasnt much action although being a fan of the series both old and new i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy,positive
that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry robert towne and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo,positive
the end result is one of the most entertaining yet simple action films made in a long while,positive
unfortunately the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow dwelling mainly on ethan and nyahs quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission impossible tv series,positive
ethans conflict is a compelling one but it seems very rushed and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes,positive
john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed closeups,positive
the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film,positive
thankfully though at the point ambrose discovers nyahs deception mission impossible ii becomes very entertaining and actionpacked,positive
robert townes screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a highrise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus,positive
after that the action scenes just begin to build in intensity as is the case with many of woos previous highoctane films,positive
the final half hour is an all out assault of action a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer unfortunately,positive
as far as summer entertainment goes mission impossible ii is serviceable fare,positive
anyone looking for hardcore action wont be disappointed except for during the first half of the film perhaps,positive
even if you werent a fan of the first film this entry deserves some checking out,positive
pg13,positive
john sayles men with guns is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power,positive
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country where the men with guns are the rulers,positive
most of the country is divided into tiny segments some are controlled by guerrillas with guns some are controlled by army soldiers with guns and all the spaces inbetween are controlled by thieves bandits and terrorists,positive
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness,positive
however like so many central american countries this one also features modernity,positive
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc but it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land or else they are simply ignorant of it,positive
the films main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls into the latter category,positive
one of his patients an army general describes him as the most educated man he has ever met and also the most naive,positive
fuentes is a true liberal a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians,positive
with government assistance he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate,positive
this program was to be his legacy and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea,positive
however when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot g s he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned,positive
as he travels deeper into the forest going from village to village the story is always the same the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers usually for helping the other,positive
when dr fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors she replies simply because they had guns and we didnt,positive
rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power,positive
dr fuentes picks up several companions during his journey all of whom are characterized by their loss,positive
first there is a young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez who has neither a mother nor a father,positive
next fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo dami n delgado who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities,positive
through his ordeal in the army domingo has lost most of his selfrespect and defines himself only by his pistol,positive
along the way the group also picks up padre portillo dami n alc zar a priest who has lost his faith,positive
as domingo is running from the army so is portillo he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer and ran away from the village in which he was preaching,positive
last the group takes on a mute girl named graciela tania cruz who hasnt spoken since she was raped two years earlier her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her,positive
sayles two major strengths as a director characters and setting are abundantly evident in men with guns,positive
like many of his films sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room but a longerthannecessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor,positive
he creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes and domingo,positive
their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the films overarching theme of violence as power domingos attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded at first it is but later is isnt,positive
the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself,positive
sayles knows how to bring a location to life whether it be an early twentiethcentury coal mining town in matewan 1987 or a contemporary bordertown in lone star 1996,positive
sayles is not a particularly inventive director he likes to let his actors do most of the work but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain,positive
sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico using all latin american actors and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects,positive
the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border,positive
it would not be a stretch to say that men with guns is a depressing film,positive
in fact the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure,positive
in addition to loss the main characters are also failures at something whether that be dr fuentes failure to change anything through medicine or padre portillos inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being,positive
nevertheless it is bleak material sayles has chosen and he deals with it accordingly,positive
the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope even in a world where as one character puts it nobody refuses the men with guns,positive
melvin van peebles sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement,positive
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident,positive
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before,positive
in style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was a cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with its subject matter,positive
van peebles a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself,positive
because no studio would dare fund such a film he was forced to raise all the money himself,positive
the movie ended up costing about 500 000 part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby,positive
van peebles cut costs by hiring nonunion labor and taking on most of the films responsibilities himself,positive
he wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film as well as starred in the central role,positive
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck,positive
for instance when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded xrating van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed a little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated x by an allwhite jury which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film,positive
he also printed the phrase on teeshirts which he had no problem selling,positive
the storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple,positive
it takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel and makes money by doing what he does best having sex,positive
one day he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like theyre bringing in suspects on a politicallycharged case involving murder,positive
however on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mumu hubert scales who they proceed to beat viciously,positive
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death,positive
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico,positive
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of l a the ghettos alleys and backstreet whorehouses that other films had always overlooked,positive
van peebles entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored,positive
at the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented but a hymn from the mouth of reality,positive
van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration,positive
of course with todays abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black innercity life as well as films by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback doesnt seem all that revolutionary,positive
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made,positive
at that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it,positive
distributors were petrified of a film that in van peebles words gave the black audience a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass,positive
of course once it caught on it caught on big,positive
sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft 1972 and the mack 1973 because those were financed by big hollywood studios,positive
sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers,positive
however even if when viewed from an africanamerican perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies,positive
when it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it,positive
there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of,positive
others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives,positive
still others point to the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm,positive
nevertheless a movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting points of view,positive
it is a revolutionary movie not because its about one mans defiance but because it put frontandcenter black issues that had never been dealt with before,positive
until that point american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites,positive
the fact that sweet sweetback was a movie by black about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the black community,positive
van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it,positive
when the movie first opened he saw it in a theater next to an older woman,positive
near the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die,positive
dont let them kill him,positive
let him die on his own,positive
it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any africanamerican in a movie who rebelled against white authority that she couldnt even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape,positive
and of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out,positive
a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues,positive
beyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be,positive
he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced a film that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time,positive
he shot in rough documentarylike fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him,positive
he makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images,positive
the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment,positive
watching sweet sweetback more than twentyfive years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite,positive
arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this film,positive
but there is more to the film than its racial aspect,positive
the legacy of sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the africanamerican perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him,positive
synopsis upper middle class suburban family man lester kevin spacey realizes that he is just going through the motions he is unable to feel passion he is soulless cynical and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure,positive
everyone else around him has similar symptoms,positive
lesters unassertive daughter jane thora birch is too lethargic to change her world yet all too ready to whine and complain,positive
his wife carolyn annette bening is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans,positive
and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living,positive
the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it a dopedealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering bullying father,positive
when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again the fact that he has quit his job to feel what its like and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl ruffle a lot of feathers in the family,positive
will lester regain his ability to appreciate life,positive
opinion people say it all the time you never appreciate good health until its gone,positive
likewise people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest most inconsequential problems simply because they have no clue how good they have it,positive
sometimes it takes a near fall accidentally or through deliberate fasting to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world,positive
the cycle is a major theme of american beauty,positive
american beauty is a nonformula intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast especially kevin spacey who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie,positive
the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum,positive
the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is,positive
if you are in the mood for a thoughtful nonformula flick i highly recommend american beauty,positive
in intolerance d w griffith told four different historical stories at the same time cutting from one to the other,positive
each of the stories builds to a fastpaced climax,positive
in magnolia paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others,positive
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent,positive
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized,positive
each story builds to a tense moment or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment but then lets the tension dissolve,positive
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along even though they are not in the same scene,positive
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again,positive
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked,positive
this creates some strange effects,positive
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships,positive
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content,positive
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge jason robards wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends,positive
phil parma philip seymour hoffman is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal,positive
partridges young wife linda julianne moore is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies but for an unsuspected reason,positive
frank mackey tom cruise runs the kinds of selfhelp seminar that businesses like so much but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shitheels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to womens lib,positive
officer jim kurring john c reilly is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place,positive
jimmy gator philip baker hall hosts a popular childrens tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector jeremy blackman and former quiz kid donnie smith william h macy,positive
the film juggles all these stories for over three hours but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily,positive
each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story,positive
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories,positive
the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history but it really has little to do with the content of the stories though they all are connected in part by one weird event,positive
magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson though in my opinion his two previous films hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories,positive
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from andersons company,positive
john c reilly seems to be a standard fixture,positive
particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight,positive
here he several of the characters are mesmerizing but that characteristic is not really used,positive
as studies of characters these stories are each worth following,positive
as wellrounded stories with a beginning middle and end they leave something to be desired,positive
but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through,positive
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
heavy spoiler,positive
heavy spoiler,positive
heavy spoiler,positive
heavy spoiler,positive
during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen,positive
and in actual fact it does,positive
since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods,positive
it is however a perfectly natural if somewhat unnerving phenomenon,positive
the cause is associated with whirlwinds,positive
we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air holding them aloft,positive
the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister,positive
smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are,positive
when the whirlwind is over water animals near the surface frequently fish and frogs may suffer the same fate,positive
essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind held aloft by updrafts and finally dropped elsewhere,positive
so while the rain is possible some doubts do creep in,positive
the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs,positive
it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped,positive
it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon,positive
frankly i have no idea on these points,positive
otherwise the event was quite believable,positive
what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano,positive
in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 2,positive
and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants,positive
however a rain of frogs though it feels biblical is most definitely not a biblical portent,positive
note that the previous verse says and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up,positive
so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river,positive
the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 13,positive
i can hear the question already,positive
what on earth do these two movies have in common,positive
to most people not a lot except that both are by renowned directors,positive
as i saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers,positive
but oh how differently the packages affect their films,positive
while everyones production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campions imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is,positive
i left everyone says i love you not remembering a lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face,positive
i left the portrait of a lady not remembering a lot about who loved whom and i could have cared less,positive
everyone features nothing allen hasnt done before storywise,positive
woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrongagain,positive
similar situations happen to his family and friends,positive
some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his early funny films,positive
the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut,positive
however nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this oneofakind display of sheer good spirits,positive
in fact in this movie the feeling itself is whats most important,positive
yes the movie would have been betteramong his very best i thinkif it had a meatier story,positive
but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling,positive
and what better way to express feeling than through music,positive
love is often best expressed in a song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart,positive
some are a tad too goofy such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor but i admired allen for even putting them in there,positive
it also helps that as usual allen has a topflight cast working with him,positive
their singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn to not quite good allen to literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed by a professional,positive
but while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience,positive
granted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned to it this film should work wonders,positive
jane campion too has a topflight cast working for her in portrait of a lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit a visually interesting one,positive
campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eyefilling images that linger in the mind,positive
unfortunately what didnt linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting,positive
i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people,positive
even worse i dont find myself feeling bad that ive forgotten,positive
the problem i think lies not with the cast which seemed to be trying very hard for the material,positive
it was the script that couldnt convince me to care about anyone,positive
the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but i found no reason to connect with any of them,positive
i understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me to care about them i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives,positive
jones script never simply gave me that opportunity,positive
in the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes,positive
unfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film,positive
in the end the movies one strength ended up hurting it,positive
so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them,positive
why,positive
with both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says i love you was able to make my heart sing,positive
blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywoods premier leading men,positive
blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it,positive
it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well,positive
although at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie,positive
the ideas behind blade are good as is the basic plot of the story,positive
but at times things seem to get a bit muddled and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once,positive
that really doesnt take away from the story too much but it does hurt it a little bit,positive
blade snipes is half man half vampire,positive
his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire,positive
including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust,positive
blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother,positive
but this isnt as easy as it seems because the vampires in blades world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films,positive
the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires,positive
where do vampires get money,positive
well in blade they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations,positive
i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea and a great addition to the movie,positive
blade runs up against the evil deacon frost stephen dorff a maverick in the vampire community,positive
he isnt content to live among humans and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority,positive
he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an allpowerful vampire rendering him virtually unstoppable,positive
its up to blade to see that this doesnt transpire,positive
admittedly blade is style over substance through and through,positive
the story is a relatively forgettable one but it is fun none the less,positive
the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type,positive
this isnt a film that is going to win accolades for its performances and the actors know this,positive
the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise,positive
its a popcorn movie and no one involved has any illusions otherwise,positive
blades production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster,positive
the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done,positive
although the mtvstyle cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences,positive
blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre,positive
this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle,positive
what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life,positive
very cool,positive
the story of us a rob reiner film is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films,positive
well 1999 has two of them the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family american beauty,positive
the story of us a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family is a well written heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience including myself cry,positive
the story of us tells the story of ben bruce willis and katie michelle pfeiffer jordan and asks the question can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage,positive
the film is about two individuals who have come together spent a good chunk of their lives together and shows when our main characters are him and her during the bad times and when they are us during the good times,positive
the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day,positive
ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they dont want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer or at least say they dont love each other anymore,positive
ben a cartoonist and katie a crossword puzzle writer have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage as they have grown to follow different views on life family and marriage,positive
katie is the more organized sophisticated type who wants to plan everything out while ben is a spontaneous adventurous individual who doesnt mind doing things differently than they were planned,positive
the story of us plays out nicely as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist told to the viewer through flashbacks,positive
as the film progresses it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage,positive
this method is highly effective as we see the characters changing from year to year slowly growing apart,positive
through the flashbacks we get to see the story of them through both of the characters eyes and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like as the story of us has three dimensional believable main characters,positive
the screenplay written by jessie nelson stepmom and alan zweibel dragnet is a touching down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer much like another one of nelsons films stepmom,positive
the script has an open honesty and outlook on life one that is so realistic you feel uncomfortable at many times because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar as most families these days most go through the hard times as ben and katie must,positive
if it wasnt for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote which are rugged and certainly flawed the story of us would have been this years best picture,positive
bruce willis a usual star has certainly turned himself around in the past year he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies to a distinguished sophisticated actor as in last summers the sixth sense and now in the story of us willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script,positive
although i wouldnt pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan willis handles himself nicely and shines in a few of the films most powerful scenes enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season,positive
where to start about michelle pfeiffer,positive
pfeiffers performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion you wonder how how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism,positive
pfeiffers performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring will be in the hearts of any viewer that has watched this moving film,positive
the story of us is one of 1999s most real yet funny films as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked,positive
superb acting direction writing story and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman make the story of us a touching unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall,positive
the films major high points are the fights between ben and katie as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed and although they also say things like its over or i hate you you can tell the two still share a deep connection and that inside somewhere they are still an us,positive
the bottom line a wonderful enchanting and heartbreaking film,positive
one of the most realistic heartbreaking films in recent years,positive
the question isnt why has grease been reissued,positive
the answer to that one is easy to celebrate the movies 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramounts coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity,positive
no the question that ought to be asked is should grease be reissued,positive
the answer is not an easy one,positive
grease is a fun movie an entertaining fantasy of the 50s embodying all the cliches of that era,positive
the music is lively and the dance numbers choreographed by patricia birch are energetic and highspirited,positive
travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon cool but nonthreatening,positive
but grease didnt break any new cinematic ground,positive
it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider,positive
what grease is or has become is the highestgrossing musical in film history,positive
ok lets not be a spoilsport,positive
grease is a fun and entertaining movie even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta olivia newtonjohn taxis jeff conaway and the multitalented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers,positive
its nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was and its sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career,positive
he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly,positive
cinematically the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur,positive
between grease and 1996s evita you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand,positive
two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated no make that cynical and jaded,positive
today if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight he or she would probably be hooted off the screen,positive
todays audiences lack the innocence that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed,positive
secondly a lack of talent,positive
performers with the charisma the style the largerthanlife panache of fred astaire gene kelly ginger rogers and judy garland are gone,positive
most singers and dancers remain on the stage and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts,positive
a good example is gregory hines one of the greatest dancers in the world,positive
he danced a bit in the cotton club tap and white nights but those were essentially dramatic vehicles,positive
so perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose,positive
if audiences show enough interest meaning if the rerelease earns the studio enough revenue it may spark a revival in movie musicals,positive
perhaps not original musicals such as singin in the rain an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years,positive
at one time or another according to the industry rumor mill hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webbers cats a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago the latter reportedly to star madonna,positive
so let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals,positive
let grease be the word that sparks this revival,positive
voices trey parker matt stone george clooney minnie driver,positive
south park bigger longer and uncut is undoubtedly crude offensive meanspirited movie that comes off as a politcally correct movie too,positive
if your canadian a strong christian fat gay or anything else you will be offended,positive
but when you watch this movie there is no doubt that you will laugh,positive
based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show south park stars cartman an overweight foulmouthed kid with attitude and a sweet side,positive
kenny a poor kid who gets killed in every episode and talks with his coat hood covering his head,positive
stan a regular sometimes boring kid who has problems with women,positive
and kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop,positive
the movie opens with a funny but messageable song that all of the people of south park sing,positive
cartman stan kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip beavis and butthead types movie asses of fire,positive
but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets they learn the movie is rated r which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 cannot get in without a parent or legal guardian,positive
the kids do not understand this and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets,positive
while in the movie laughing at the movie terrance and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids,positive
they kids then go out and cuss themselves getting in trouble and causing kyles mom to go against the mpaa,positive
while doing this kenny learns a thing or to by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire,positive
kenny does so dies and goes to hell to find out that satan and saddam huiessan homosexual lovers are about to take over the world if terrance and phillip die,positive
from here on nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise,positive
but believe me this isnt your regular south park tv show and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more,positive
this film contains extreme profanity over 130 f words and a collection of others,positive
but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way south park bigger longer and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it,positive
but i bet you will not leave the movie for at least laughing one time or more,positive
and enjoying yourself,positive
take it from me south park b l and u isnt as good as youd hope but it is good for some laughs,positive
harmless silly and fun comedy about dimwitted wrestling fans gordie and sean david arquette and scott caan who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king oliver platt,positive
when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter joe pantoliano gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory,positive
my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed but not fake mind you,positive
the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that,positive
arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances which is exactly what a movie like this requires and oliver platt one of my favorite actors is a riot as the drunken washedup exchampion,positive
many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record but for me it just added to the silly factor of the film thereby increasing my enjoyment of it,positive
one casting complaint however rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer,positive
please,positive
if rose mcgowan is sexy then im marilyn manson,positive
given the current state of the actual wcw if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming hed be the most popular guy they have,positive
on a similar note the plot line of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years,positive
although one does have to ask,positive
why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans,positive
director brian robbins youll remember him as eric from tvs head of the class just knows how to make good dumb movies,positive
this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues,positive
and screenwriter steven brill the epic mighty ducks trilogy late last night manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me,positive
the only exceptions to that were 1 a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan,positive
those moments made me cringe groan,positive
as an added bonus though the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll,positive
pg13,positive
plot a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesnt quite know what she wants out of life,positive
one day she falls upon something and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others,positive
she starts with the people around her but when she suddenly falls for her own guy she cant act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature,positive
critique a clever quirky original french flick set in a picturesque paris featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone,positive
this is a feelgood kind of movie a fairy tale for grownups who are bummed out about life,positive
it doesnt pretend to be deep it doesnt weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters its basically just a cute movie in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year a sham on so many different levels you might as well slap this film up for consideration also since its quite a bit better and much more original than the former,positive
one thing that this film isnt though at least according to me is the best film of the year it was bestowed the honor of best in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year,positive
it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long its a little over two hours but it felt even longer with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters all of whom werent as interesting as the lead and a lot of indecisiveness from ms amelie herself which got frustrating,positive
thankfully this film doesnt bog itself down with too much of that stuff and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kindhearted french girl,positive
on the whole its a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man,positive
the lead audrey tautou is perfect for the role and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film,positive
unfortunately the rest of the cast isnt as welldeveloped and even though most of them are pretty appealing a couple couldve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plotwise by the films end what happened to the guy in the caf who was spying on his exgirlfriend the whole movie,positive
now i havent seen too many recent french films i will admit but if this is the kind of scene that theyre developing over in le pays du vin i wouldnt mind catching more of their flicks in the future crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year which i really liked ironically that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz who is the costar in this film,positive
granted the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times i speak and understand french also but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head especially since the films visuals were so intriguing that you just couldnt help but constantly gawk at them but the general idea the background music the nifty french neighborhoods the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the storyline from the start were all very easy to appreciate and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world,positive
in fact id recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol time at the movie house with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts,positive
and this guy directed alien resurrection,positive
get outta here,positive
note i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the of everyone with exact mentions in the film,positive
it was very original very well shot and very nostalgic as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described,positive
good stuff,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
chocolat 610 crimson rivers 810 ghost world 910 like water for chocolate 810 o brother where art thou 710 pay it forward 510 rushmore 910 woman on top 710,positive
bob the happy bastards quickie review,positive
i must admit no doubts single new is quite catchy,positive
it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back,positive
the result,positive
a movie thats just as good as that song really,positive
it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend,positive
first we hear about a grocery bagger sara polley who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave with bad results as a drug dealer feels hes been swindled by her then comes the story of an english grocery store worker same store who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends where sex gunplay and stolen car trouble come into play then we see the story of two gay movie actors played by scott wolf and jay mohr who deal with a cops strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl sara with their car and finally we come to another grocery worker katie holmes who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer the one mentioned earlier,positive
really its all confusing to keep track of in review format your best bet is to just well go,positive
the movie features some very good acting from all angles and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product,positive
the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending,positive
think of it as a well ending,positive
the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie as its never really confusing and tells different sides of the story like sliding doors kinda did,positive
however its better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks which sliding doors kinda isnt,positive
perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects,positive
there is no question that actionadventure and science movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise,positive
whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion contemporary films like jurassic park are multimilliondollar creations of computer technology,positive
the latest in this visually awesome series of movies the wachowski brothers the matrix is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movies story,positive
unlike many scifi movies which promote themselves as effectsheavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event,positive
it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the films length,positive
contrary to popular trend the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound,positive
in this regard the movie is something like a card sharp,positive
with its flashy mass stripped away the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented,positive
the script is characteristically weak and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach,positive
but like the card sharp the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent,positive
the viewers dont care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner,positive
and right around the corner they usually are for the script tells a fastpaced albeit frequently revisited story,positive
as the movie explains the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind,positive
billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence the matrix farms our life energy,positive
only a select group of individuals knows of the real world and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultracool morpheus laurence fishburne,positive
morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo keanu reeves believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth,positive
the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion,positive
the set design is very dynamic running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy,positive
the costumes as well as the actors who wear them add to the roles,positive
for instance the manifested antagonists in the movie a group of agents created by the matrix in its computer program all dress in matching secret servicewear the rebel fighters on the other hand dress in rich hues of leather,positive
the casting cannot be criticized for the typically stoic reeves isnt required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool,positive
supports in carrieanne moss joe pantoliano and hugo weaving are all effectual,positive
one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last years science fiction masterpiece dark city particularly if one ponders how this same premise wouldve worked from a different approach,positive
the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear here the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrillride motion picture with little abandon and much noise,positive
the better picture between the two depends on the viewer but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun,positive
weir is wellrespected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subjectmatter into deceptively simple powerful films the mosquito coast utopia and fearless posttraumatic stress disorder among them,positive
in the truman show weir essentially breathes life into the nowtired concept of mediamanipulation by tackling the material from the insideout,positive
it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in topform playing the title character truman burbank,positive
by now you must be aware of the premise unbeknownst to him truman carrey is the star of his own tv series a 247 peepshow in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants,positive
seahaven his hometown and the show itself are the brainchild of christof harris who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras,positive
for 30 years truman suspects nothingwe accept the reality were given poses christofbut a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in fiji mcelhone who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement overwhelms him,positive
thus christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highlyrated program,positive
in a few broad strokes weir creates a convincing secondreality and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost threequarters through,positive
this allows us to comprehend and accept trumans world before we contextualize it,positive
for all his madness christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it,positive
truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be well so darn nice like a sibling or perhaps more appropriately a caged animal in an interactive zoo they want to see him succeed,positive
the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carreyhe really is an everyman here abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible wideeyed bewilderment,positive
cinematically the truman show is impeccable stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images,positive
as well it employs wojciech kilars piece zycie za zycie masterfully and beautifully,positive
if the film has any flaws one may find them in laura linneys characterization as meryl trumans wife i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone and in a subplot involving trumans father which feels curiously incomplete,positive
there are a few stupendous sequences and the film pulls off a wonderful trick we become trumans audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film,positive
they wear buttons asking how will it end,positive
i couldnt wait to know myself though i didnt exactly want it to end for this inspired movie is possibly the bestand most complexsummer picture in years,positive
in a flashback the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film the hanging garden tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance,positive
horrified the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows the rule of 6,positive
if you dont break off a kiss by the count of 6 then you committed a sin with the boy,positive
and most of all the grandmother wants to know if she has protection,positive
she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times,positive
the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style,positive
although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture that moniker misses the mark,positive
yes every member of the household has their own special problems but the writer didnt choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident,positive
this delightful little picture mixes love tragedy and pathos resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction,positive
during the opening credits we observe the boy sweet william at the center of the story,positive
first hes an average sized young lad who is slapped offscreen by his father,positive
next hes 300 pound teenager played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte,positive
when the opening credits end we cut to 10 years later,positive
william is now an averagesized reasonably happy adult played with love and compassion by chris leavins,positive
william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his freespirited and foulmouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover fletcher joe s keller,positive
kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy,positive
nicole burnell who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter plays the teenage rosemary,positive
the father of the family whiskey mac peter macneill is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful,positive
his wife iris seana mckenna says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids,positive
rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nineyearold violet the sister whom william meets for the first time,positive
as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home william wanders off to try on one of his old coats which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self,positive
the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways,positive
he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways,positive
rosmarys trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath all while talking to her brother,positive
as much as anything the film is a series of character sketches,positive
in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter a homosexual one,positive
although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex his mother is aghast,positive
a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife dusty miller martha irving who for a fee will have heterosexual sex with william,positive
with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational,positive
dusty after asking iris to watch her daughter takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex,positive
all of this notwithstanding he still prefers males,positive
the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes facetoface with himself when younger,positive
this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited,positive
in the most devastating he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself,positive
even here the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker,positive
the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot,positive
the hanging garden runs 1 31,positive
it is rated r for strong sexuality language violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature,positive
well ill be damned what a most excellent surprise,positive
not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring exporn star traci lords this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950s drivein schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best scifi flick of 1995,positive
once again bmovie king roger corman is behind this effort he directed the original but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer,positive
the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns,positive
it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries because its an absolute mustsee for scifi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent,positive
the plot in brief,positive
paul johnson michael york is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who though needing to kill people to live is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons,positive
his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure the key of which lies in the blood of humans,positive
he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr rochelle whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf,positive
he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda elizabeth barondes to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires,positive
but before long amanda and johnsons sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric,positive
i must admit my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging,positive
british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat 1972,positive
but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding,positive
the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech the dapper clothes and cool spectacles the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character,positive
york is by turns hilarious menacing and tragic,positive
this is a tourdeforce and quite simply the best performance ive seen from him,positive
and while obviously made on a modest budget the film boasts enormous strengths,positive
the casting is spot on the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent witty and consistently engaging cleverly updating the original,positive
the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988,positive
the film doesnt drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of littleknown director terrance h winkless,positive
and it doesnt matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy this is schlock after all even if it is high class schlock,positive
in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end,positive
tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their lifethreatening situation,positive
but these are minor complaints,positive
just see it,positive
not of this earth is one of the biggest scifi surprises in years,positive
and michael york in one cool swoop youve made yourself a bmovie legend dude,positive
in enemy at the gates jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov joseph fiennes who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad,positive
its world war ii and the russiangerman standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland,positive
laws vassili is the russians top pawn to victory,positive
lots of war stuff happens,positive
an older german version of judes character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings,positive
hes equally talented and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other,positive
they constantly switch roles as the war fades far into the background,positive
the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov,positive
the setup is decent and so are the production values,positive
boasting a wide range of grimy locales greasy hair and tattered costumes the art direction prospers,positive
the actors however suffer the problem matt damon had in saving private ryan,positive
either their eyes teeth skin or a combination of other features looked too white and clean,positive
with dirt and blood all around the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action,positive
that said the players are mostly good in their roles although i dont think ed harris was really trying,positive
maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in onenotedom,positive
while the film is technically about snipers there are far too many predictable sniping scenes,positive
director jeanjacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting but after about the sixth time in which we realize that jude is not going to die its relatively pointless,positive
we get that hes talented okay lets move on,positive
thats the problem with enemy at the gates it just doesnt know when to stop,positive
witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere,positive
reestablishing his title as the most beautiful and often talented man on film jude law carries the movie,positive
without him this costly production would have gone into the ground,positive
the story and acting are of good quality but theres never a sense of authenticity or reality,positive
something about this war movie is undeniably modern and it loses its feeling,positive
strange enough the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper,positive
when you go to the movies as much as i do you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times,positive
such was the case with frequency,positive
every time i went to a screening there was the frequency preview,positive
it looked awful,positive
it looked cheesy sappy and ridiculous,positive
it looked like a flop,positive
well whoever put that trailer together should be fired because in terms of pure entertainment frequency is one of the best of the year thus far,positive
frequency boasts a compelling story line,positive
an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan james caviezel to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan dennis quaid through a ham radio despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years,positive
john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire but by doing so causes other changes,positive
somehow a serial killers reign of terror which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders extends to ten victims,positive
including johns mother,positive
this is director gregory hoblits third film the other two being primal fear and fallen,positive
with all three hes managed to attach himself to great scripts this one by toby emmerich whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films and add equally great direction,positive
also he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kickass ending,positive
frequency is no exception the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying,positive
hoblit is three for three and i hope he can keep it up,positive
now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the scifi elements of frequency,positive
but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved,positive
whos to say how something works and how it doesnt when its never happened,positive
is it because weve become accustomed to time travel laws from other places like star trek and the back to the future trilogy and quantum leap,positive
yes if you sit down and think about it certain plot elements in this film probably wont make any sense,positive
most films are like that,positive
dont let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however,positive
when frequency was over it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug okay okay shut up,positive
when you break it down past all its scifi elements and serial killer antics frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share,positive
its touching its sincere and its what ultimately makes this movie work,positive
pg13,positive
why do so many childrens films treat their target audience with utter contempt,positive
too many of those who write or direct for childrens movies assume that the kids just cant handle serious thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues,positive
the iron giant which was directed and cowritten by brad bird late of such animated series as the simpsons and king of the hill assumes that not only can children handle such discussions but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time,positive
the iron giant holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience making it a film thats enjoyable for both children and adults alike,positive
hogarth hughes voice of eli marienthal is a spirited young lad who lives with his hardworking single mother annie jennifer aniston in a small town in maine,positive
after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception,positive
he comes across a giant robot vin diesel from space that eats metal for food,positive
after saving the robot nicknamed the iron giant from electric shock hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts,positive
because of damage he suffered upon landing the giant has forgotten what his original mission was so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy,positive
realizing he cant just keep the giant in a barn all the time and that the giant needs food he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean harry connick jr an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time,positive
it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth cant keep the giant a secret forever because a government spook named kent mansley christopher mcdonald has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security,positive
he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant and takes up residence in hogarths house as a lodger,positive
meanwhile the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind,positive
the iron giant is exactly what family films ought to be because it doesn t talk down to its audience,positive
the story is simple very simple about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy,positive
its very similar to the spielberg classic e t and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of the iron giant,positive
the film holds many of the better elements of spielbergs film such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy,positive
the film delivers several serious messages the most important of which is ones ability to choose ones own fate,positive
hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be a hero,positive
the final sequence is touching and appropriate though i wont give it away i will say that very few will be disappointed,positive
the animation while not up to disney standards what could be after tarzan is good enough to make you forget youre watching a cartoon,positive
the giant is computeranimated while the human characters are all handdrawn the oldfashioned way,positive
the characters faces are done quite well drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief,positive
fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother,positive
harry connick jr does a nice characterization as dean and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney of tvs frasier as an army general called in by agent mansley,positive
unlike several cartoon features each character is actually a developed personality rather than a stereotype and is actually integral to the plot rather than being a superfluous comicrelief sidekick a clich disney still hasnt ditched,positive
dean for example could have been a stereotypical beatnik his character profile seems to suggest that but he is presented as a character with real emotions thoughts and motivations,positive
even the heavy agent mansley is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to but out of his own fear and paranoia,positive
a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paperthin stereotypes and figure the kids wont mind but the iron giant has clearly put a little work into making the characters real and it pays off,positive
the film isnt only around to deliver heavyhanded messages though,positive
its also very funny and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy,positive
the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things such as dive into a pool are handled well and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing having worked on the simpsons for many years,positive
a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to outlast one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed and also extremely clever,positive
the film even takes some jabs at americas nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to duck and cover in the event of a nuclear attack,positive
the iron giant has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing,positive
instead of seeing people get bonked on the head we get welltimed clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with,positive
when you get right down to it the iron giant is no more than the story of a boy and his robot,positive
the story is so straightforward so quaint that it ultimately becomes charming,positive
though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person when it comes to family entertainment simple is the way to go,positive
its akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word but its not the story that sets the film above others of its kind but rather the elements that go into the story namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue which the iron giant has in spades,positive
last night could have an aka tagged on the end of it that says its the end of the world and we feel fine,positive
last night is about just that,positive
the last night of planet earths existence,positive
the world is going to end at precisely midnight january 1st 2000,positive
how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained,positive
nor is the event itself,positive
throughout the entire movie no explanation is given as to why this is happening,positive
in doing this mckellar who also wrote and directed the film seems to be trying to transcend the genre,positive
hes attempted to make a film about people and how each of them deals with their last night of life,positive
the film contains no science fiction elements which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters,positive
mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material,positive
the film is set in toronto and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence,positive
theres mckellar who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs but keeps getting interrupted by a woman sandra oh in search of her husband,positive
her husband played by david cronenberg is spending the day working at the gas company informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end,positive
finally theres mckellars friend played by callum keith rennie a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of,positive
mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters ive seen in a film in months,positive
these people all felt real to me especially the character played by sandra oh,positive
we can see her desperation her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours,positive
rennie is good too as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies,positive
he exudes such charm and likeablity its not surprising that were rooting for him to get what he wants,positive
but for me the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar,positive
i knew that he was a talented director but i had no idea he could act as well,positive
his insistence to be alone much to the dismay of his parents is something that most people would find difficult to understand but as played by mckellar we can understand his reasons,positive
he doesnt buy into the whole notion that just because everyones going to die he should immediately find some companionship,positive
he realizes the relationship would be forced and they would only be together for the sake of being together,positive
mckellar gives a brilliant performance and i hope he alternates between directing and acting,positive
my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending,positive
i really wanted to know and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times,positive
i appreciate the fact that mckellar didnt want the material to rule the film and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious,positive
however in not telling the audience what the cause of earths destruction is hes left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film,positive
another problem is we never see anybody panicking,positive
i would imagine if the world was ending and there was nothing to be done about it a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds,positive
instead we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like its new years eve,positive
i just didnt buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate,positive
no one had the urge to rage against the dying of the light,positive
despite these small problems last night is one of the best movies of the year,positive
as opposed to the moronic armageddon last night treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty,positive
and bruce willis never shows up to save the day,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
east meets west in mulan the latest installment in disneys parade of annual animated feature films,positive
an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious massmarket commercial sensibilities this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years but falls short of actualizing its potential,positive
though not for lack of trying,positive
in many respects mulan is among disneys most mature efforts skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat,positive
the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized the imagery of a pillaged village neatly encapsulated in the form of a childs discarded doll is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars and mulans later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy bloodless method imaginable yet how often does a hollywood animated film long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner,positive
in an instant idealistic mulans innocence is lost and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending,positive
the film based upon an ancient chinese fable centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her familys obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones replete with glowing yellow eyes and daggeredged teeth although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace,positive
dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western european fables and literature for decades disneys new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere story intact to some neutral territory and revels in its east asian roots aside from a predominantly asianamerican cast providing the films vocal work theres liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence,positive
while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes invoking pseudoasian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary and i cant imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors really included karatechopping blocks of stone in two its rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory,positive
the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately its startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulans land,positive
at its core the film is a tale of heroic adventure and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour perseverance nobility and courage,positive
as such animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work handinhand with visual purity,positive
scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action such as mulans venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation,positive
mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments particularly during our heroines characterdefining opening halfhour,positive
its when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation the friendly animal sidekick the colourful array of supporting characters into the mix where it goes slightly awry,positive
off to battle mulan finds herself being trailed by a jivetalking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little lucky cricket who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audiencefriendly comic relief,positive
theyre affable presences and not precisely ineffective reasonable amounts of humour are elicited and eddie murphy who voices mushu is amusingly earnest but amidst all the high melodrama the effect is mildly jarring and from a storytelling perspective questionable in its necessity,positive
at training camp mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits easily characterized simply as the short clown the skinny clown and the big clown who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness and in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns she grows a certain fondness for a handsome squarejawed young captain shang,positive
everybody needs love even ancient chinese warrior princesses but not necessarily in this film,positive
the romantic angle which lets the air out of the sails of the storys neofeminist underpinnings lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation,positive
another staple of recent disney animated films a cache of hummable little ditties has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness,positive
composed by matthew wilder none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing and one ill make a man out of you unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable,positive
only reflections an early ballad of lament proves to be a song of any consequence serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga one of musical theatres most wondrously pure voices,positive
nonetheless mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork the computergenerated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive,positive
while the blatantly childfriendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film theyre not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable,positive
briskly paced with a smart energetic heroine and filled with high adventure the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter,positive
a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july,positive
i didnt really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family,positive
the movie bombed at the box office and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based,positive
my real concern though was the general reputation of snlrelated movies translating to the big screen with lessthanstellar results halfbaked anyone,positive
i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining often hilarious yet also touching little film,positive
it is an al franken production throughandthrough who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture,positive
for those of you who dont know al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley who has a really annoying show on a publicaccess station about increasing your selfesteem etc although not a licensed therapist stuart smalley is as the program proudly boasts a graduate of several 12step programs,positive
stuart is doing well enough with his tv show but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles,positive
stuarts relatives are a mess his dad and brother harris yulin and vincent donofrio respectively are alcoholics his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce and his mom is in constant selfdenial and solves all perceived problems by baking,positive
then disaster strikes,positive
stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked,positive
he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself and there the comedy truly picks up,positive
franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes but as sharplydrawn real people,positive
although smalleys dad has always imbibed too much stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy,positive
also after an accident towards the end of the movie both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought,positive
although filled with small very funny scenes stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments especially towards the conclusion,positive
for a lightweight comedy it handles these scenes especially well often better than many socalled serious dramas of today,positive
all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a onejoke bit,positive
if you feel like renting a comedy and you havent seen this film i definitely recommend you try this one out,positive
youll laugh youll,positive
cry its,positive
all there,positive
seen april 16 1999 at 10 p m at crossgates cinema 18 guilderland n y theater 15 by myself for free using my hoyts critics pass,positive
theater rating 12 very good seats sound and picture,positive
do you realize that every time you encounter a new person youve just become part of a story,positive
everyone has their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but a part nevertheless,positive
that seems to be the basic theory behind go where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways,positive
in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldnt usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them such as a teenage supermarket cashier a bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors,positive
these types of characters might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father a midlevel drug dealer a narc obsessed with multilevelmarketing horny wedding guests a zen lovemaker two shrimpscarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out,positive
how they will all come together is the process the film deals with,positive
id imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general,positive
the film starts out as anything else with little indication of whats to come,positive
we meet ronna polley a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesnt seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent,positive
shes not very charming especially to her customers but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works,positive
maybe this is because shes not a very afeminite character but shes far from masculine a creative character indeed,positive
things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences,positive
this agreement starts a threepronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug,positive
the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death,positive
nearly the same can be said for two other characters zack mohr and adam wolf who we dont think much of when they first appear as supporting characters but later will become major players to the films makeup another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be,positive
once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle,positive
when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene its clear this film isnt going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling,positive
considering how good it is up until that point its a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today,positive
and so the film begins to take shape first by following ronna and her friends on a onenight adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesnt exactly go as planned but thats what keeps it all so interesting,positive
the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronnas story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead,positive
simon and his three friends head to vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined,positive
the third arc about zack and adam again overlaps with ronnas story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle,positive
were shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna,positive
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam arent even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were,positive
id really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who havent seen the film,positive
perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking,positive
still i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well,positive
direction trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman its a great accomplishment,positive
he doesnt just depict a story he wraps us up in it all pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low,positive
screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general its clear the script has been inspired by many sources with both obvious and subtle references yet it never screams ripoff,positive
where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre,positive
its not overlydark or twisted and the comedy isnt so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy more like macabre light,positive
direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner,positive
characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture were able to get a sense of who they are what theyre thinking and how they came to be in their situations,positive
even when their actions are surprising it never seems very out of synch,positive
performances every actor nails their role see above,positive
the film doesnt seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages instead its more of a philosophical experiment,positive
in fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all,positive
and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure,positive

as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens i have some idea of how ellie aroway jodie foster feels,positive
but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers i cant say that i do exactly,positive
her reason is that she needs solid proof there is no proof that god existed so therefor she does not believe,positive
ellie also believes in aliens and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist,positive
how can she say she doesnt believe in god because of the lack of proof and then say she believes in aliens which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite,positive
thats the catch22,positive
when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them okay well they didnt really fax them,positive
ellie wants to be the one to go but because of her atheism she is denied the position,positive
how dumb is that,positive
she discovers the transmitions then she isnt allowed to go,positive
well because of a bomb and a psychopath jake busey she does end up going but not in the way that we wouldve thought,positive
contact is based on a novel by carl sagan who died during the filmmaking,positive
it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind and will end up being the best film of the year,positive
its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some but will stimulate more,positive
im glad at least one movie of the 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body,positive
mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tvshow er,positive
her mast famous episode loves labour lost dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child,positive
the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing,positive
there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywoods big blockbuster movies,positive
so its only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster,positive
and i have to say after a shaky beginning she does not disappoint,positive
peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists which is obviously nothing new,positive
the first half hour goes into detail way too much detail about how the weapons are stolen,positive
despite a few good images including a train collision and a very impressive explosion none of this was very coherent,positive
its long and drawn out and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better,positive
once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture it begins to take off,positive
george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world,positive
he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters,positive
nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling,positive
there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two but that is dispensed with quickly,positive
the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them clooney,positive
goes through bouts of sarcasm frustration determination and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and selfdoubt,positive
this is when leder starts to show her true stuff,positive
she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer,positive
then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter,positive
then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york citys crowded streets and a madman with a nuke walking among them,positive
mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense,positive
she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking,positive
nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero,positive
youre not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her,positive
george clooney is a real movie star,positive
many of you may have hated him as batman but this guy is for real,positive
he has a natural screen presence and an ingratiating personality,positive
hell be around for a while,positive
dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker,positive
capsule trippy hyperspeed action machine from hong kongs accomplished tsui hark,positive
van damme and rodman have nice chemistry the stunts are eyepopping and stuff gets blowed up real good what more do you want,positive
i admit i was all set to loathe double team it reeked of cheapjack timingoriented marketing stick dennis rodman in a movie quick while hes hot and do something about jeanclaude van dammes flagging career while were at it,positive
surprise double team transcends its dumb roots and turns out to be a mess of fun,positive
bring some friends get some pretzels and have a blast,positive
van damme is jack quinn an exagent who is brought back in for one last mission youd think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words,positive
but van dammes character has a pregnant wife whos also a sculptor and some unpleasant pressure gets used to get him to come through on this mission,positive
hes been assigned to take down an old enemy a terrorist named stavros mickey rourke looking oddly subdued who may be back up to his old tricks,positive
in the first showdown between quinn and stavros the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve nonstop action,positive
an amusement park a hospital a private retired spy s retreat most of rome various houses planes cars and other modes of transport and the coliseum,positive
all become arenas for some of the most bonerattling shootouts and punchouts filmed,positive
they are better seen than described and are reason enough to see the film one jawdropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his feet,positive
van damme is a good dextrous athlete and fighter but he is often upstaged,positive
there are other nice touches,positive
stavros and quinn both want the same thing to retire in peace with their families,positive
that ambition ties them together in various ways and also humanizes them a bit,positive
one of the things about hk action movies is that theres always some form of human element and thats carried over into this movie as well,positive
it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable,positive
also good is dennis rodman playing a weapons dealer named yaz a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there,positive
rodman is natural on screen hes fun to watch especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs and deserves to get a movie of his own based on whats seen here a lightweight fastmoving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently,positive
well ill be damned,positive
the canadians can make a good movie,positive
the world is coming to an end,positive
we dont know why or how but apparently there is no way to stop it,positive
the world has had this information for months as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations,positive
yet for a handful of toronto citizens life goes on,positive
they arent going crazy or attacking people in the streets,positive
instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end,positive
some engaging in activities theyve always wanted to do some gathering with family and friends and others just seeking to be alone,positive
these peoples lives however all intersect during their final six hours,positive
writerdirectorstar don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film,positive
all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth,positive
craig callum keith rennie tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies a gas company employee david cronenberg calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business and patrick mckellar just wants to be by himself but isnt having much success,positive
even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to tying everyone even closer,positive
things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film but ultimately everything comes together nicely although its not a happy film,positive
some moments are understandably gutwrenching,positive
the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances particularly from sandra oh whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end,positive
i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight in toronto anyway,positive
but i do wonder why the sun never sets,positive
come midnight the sun is still shining brightly,positive
maybe the sun is crashing into the earth,positive
who knows,positive
also its comforting to know that in mankinds final moments on the planet people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus thats not a shot at this film mind you,positive
i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars,positive
last night is available on dvd from universal home video,positive
it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer,positive
r,positive
a couple of months ago when i first downloaded the trailer from the net my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold yawn,positive
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this pisspoor trailer,positive
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u s unique excellent mustsee,positive
well i thought still skeptical i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here,positive
here of course was still three months away,positive
ill admit when i trotted off to see this film the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow,positive
id heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled but his films were definitely not on my mustsee list,positive
that let me tell you has changed completely,positive
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet,positive
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick,positive
seriously,positive
ive never been a big john travolta fan but he like cage perfectly suited his role in the movie sorry,positive
make that roles in the movie,positive
even travoltas great performance however paled in comparison to cages character portrayals,positive
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hasslers hideout,positive
half drugged out of his mind he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his sons death from castors perspective doesnt it just break your heart he mutters coldly,positive
now dont go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie its not,positive
thats what really makes this movie unique,positive
its an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters not a common mix at all,positive
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though thats,positive
the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other and,positive
never hit,positive
several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press rewind and watch it over again,positive
the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a doublesided mirror is just plain brilliant,positive
whilst cages and travoltas performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies the lesser characters are just as intriguing,positive
joan allen who usually sticks to the straight drama movies plays her part perfectly as archers long suffering wife,positive
i like the fact that her character didnt end up toting a gun at the end of the movie it,positive
would have wrecked her potrayal,positive
gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troys mistreated girlfriend make that one of castor troys mistreated girlfriends,positive
other movies would have used her character as just window dressing a,positive
sex object but instead her character is very strong and independent,positive
dominique swain who plays archers daughter also does a nice job though her character is not as explored as much as allens or gershons,positive
faults well there were some i have to say,positive
first the movies ending whilst being very good overall was a bit too drawn out for its own good,positive
after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you cant help but think geez are you guys nuclear powered or what,positive
there were certain bits that werent handled properly like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil more explanation here would have been nice,positive
overall this movie was not perfect,positive
but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect,positive
many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made i,positive
certainly hope so,positive
of all the films ive come to see this year 1997 i think only chasing amy had as many laughoutloud moments,positive
im not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes,positive
and i think im the kind of person that laughs least at movies even when i find them funny,positive
usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile so to get me laughing out loud and so frequently is a really good sign,positive
waiting for guffman is the story of blaine missouri a town celebrating its 150th anniversary and the musical that is being put on for the big event,positive
the play is being directed by corky st clair christopher guest who also wrote and directed this mockumentary as well as cowriting several original musical numbers the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success,positive
teaming up with st clair are a handful of blaine residents allan pearl eugene levy a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown but sitting right next to him and studying him ron and sheila albertson fred willard and catherine ohara respectively a married couple setting their sights on hollywood libby mae brown parker posey the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen and a few others,positive
everybody in this movie is brilliant absolutely so but levy particularly stands out,positive
these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you cant help but love them as pathetic as they really are,positive
although levy stands out guest willard ohara and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances,positive
if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance this is the group that should sweep it,positive
some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and even after starting very humorously they nearly lost me with the tadtoolong intros,positive
as delightful as it was it began to get monotonous,positive
thankfully just as your about to say ok maybe i should run to the bathroom they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes,positive
like a play this film gives a very threeact feel the intros funny but almost too long the rehearsals even funnier and finally the actual performance of the play excellent,positive
like i said each character really shines even when done with a subtle approach,positive
you cant really watch these people and not think theyre real people,positive
even they way they talk with awkward pauses and stumbles that dont feel staged at all you feel like youre watching a real albeit funny documentary,positive
and even with silly lyrics the original songs when the play is finally put on are absolutely wonderful,positive
as a word of note despite its r rating waiting for guffman is really quite clean,positive
this rating came from a brief very brief use of the granddaddy of all swear words,positive
even if that really bothers you let me say that its not presented in a vulgar cheaplaugh way,positive
its actually quite humorous and tastefully done,positive
it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman,positive
its silly humor but its also so dry subtle and intelligently done that youre not insulted by it,positive
its always really nice to see a comedy that isnt all slapstick and vulgarity and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones,positive
id recommend seeing it,positive
sam matthew broderick is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda kelly preston,positive
he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton tch ky karyo comes as a complete surprise to him,positive
but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back,positive
he moves into an abandoned house across the street from antons apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them,positive
suddenly antons ex maggie shows up but she does not want her former lover back,positive
on the contrary all she wants to do is vaporize him,positive
she may say that she doesnt want to kill him but the possibility doesnt bother her too much either,positive
after all people die every day,positive
in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on,positive
the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times,positive
but we havent,positive
griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since while you where sleeping,positive
the camera obscura adds a special something to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy,positive
everything about the movie is perfect from set design to casting,positive
the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite,positive
meg ryan known from when harry met sally or sleepless in seattle surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image,positive
she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl,positive
even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her much more so than in last years courage under fire where she played a gulf war pilot,positive
matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality,positive
the viewer can tell that he doesnt only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them,positive
he has trouble keeping in touch with reality,positive
after all who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love,positive
his naivet that we dont question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge,positive
she would do anything to harm anton,positive
she doesnt hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them,positive
that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier,positive
tch ky karyo is perfect as anton,positive
he is well repulsive,positive
thats all there is to say about him,positive
you cant really manage to pity him even after all his mishaps,positive
he not only took sams bride away from him he is also a french chef,positive
worlds collide i,positive
e,positive
the usa and france,positive
this can only go wrong,positive
even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking you just cant sympathize with a man who plays je taime moi,positive
non plus on his tape deck,positive
not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for,positive
sam certainly isnt,positive
too bad for anton,positive
for him things take a turn to the worse,positive
addicted to love is one of this years most pleasant surprises,positive
there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actors effort,positive
often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile,positive
when one of these comes along i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders,positive
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case with the hurricane,positive
this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally be called norman jewisons the hurricane as per the tradition of referring to a film belonging to a director,positive
but though he does decent work jewison cannot claim ownership of the hurricane because there is one reason this film works at all and his name is denzel washington,positive
washington plays carter a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a latenight shooting in a bar,positive
jailed for 20 years he maintained that he had never committed the crimes but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals,positive
the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter,positive
through the efforts of that group and carters lawyers he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted,positive
the film details carters childhood which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop dan hedaya,positive
when he finally got out of prison for good carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career on track until the police framed him for multiple homicide,positive
despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities he remained imprisoned,positive
flash forward to 1983 when lesra vicellous reon shannon a young africanamerican boy living with a group of canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while in prison,positive
the book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesras eyes to the injustice that was carters life and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer,positive
lesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah to work with him towards his goal,positive
the hurricane leans on denzel washington,positive
he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will and he does so brilliantly,positive
its probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be,positive
it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin cartera fictional personality invented solely for the film,positive
the actors work is masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing to keep the audience at arms length,positive
we feel everything he feels the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost,positive
washingtons is a performance of weight and emotional depth,positive
he doesnt merely play angry happy or sad he feels it at the deepest level,positive
his work is masterful and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor,positive
norman jewison directs the film doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection,positive
the hurricane moves quickly with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely,positive
jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is and nothing is terribly confusing,positive
his boxing scenes constructed with clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable as real sports footage,positive
jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform and jewison assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell,positive
jewisons best achievement in the hurricane is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hardknock life and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again,positive
sadly though the films chief failures lie with the screenplay as with most of the goodbutnotgreat efforts to round the pike this winter,positive
there is much to interest a viewer in the hurricane but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich d route possible it does,positive
take a look at the supporting characters for example who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil,positive
carter and lesra played nicely by shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else is a stereotype,positive
the canadians are good,positive
the cops are bad,positive
the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their loveydovey commune and it is a commune despite the films failure to make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedayas melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room,positive
much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey hate put me in prison,positive
loves gonna bust me out and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a madefortv lifetime special,positive
its too bad,positive
the cast is game the director does his job and the subject matter is interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often,positive
i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than hes a racist pig,positive
i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice,positive
in short i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens,positive
criticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes with the truth of what really happened to carter and much of it is deserved,positive
for example the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only to be screwed by the judges who ruled giardello the winner,positive
most accounts of the fight however have carter losing fairly,positive
furthermore much of carters criminal past is conveniently left out of the film and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained,positive
of course the hurricane works mainly as a fable so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially but even dismissing such issues dont remove one fact the hurricane is a highly flawed film,positive
only one actor could have made a schmaltzy predictable picture like this work as well as it does and its a good thing the hurricane has that actor,positive
carter has been quoted as saying denzel washington is making me look good but hes not the only one,positive
washington makes this film look good,positive
denzel washingtons the hurricane,positive
sounds pretty good to me,positive
a movie thats been as highly built up as the truman show with reviews boasting the film of the decade,positive
and a breakthrough,positive
can only be leading up to letdown,positive
thats no doubt it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think youre going in for the ride of your life that youll end up changed on the other side and you come out of the theater going eh,positive
thats what all the fuss was about,positive
so naturally the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment,positive
and i convinced myself as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair actually to try not to enjoy it,positive
let me tell you that is an impossibilty,positive
the truman show is truly the film of the decade and a breakthrough and more,positive
and you will come out changed on the other side,positive
such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling and this friends is it,positive
jim carrey shows that he doesnt need to talk out of his butt to entertain us that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywoods leading men,positive
the film has a difficult premise to tackle trying to set us up thirty years into the truman shows run but tackle it it does and perfectly,positive
with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show you get the sense that you are viewing a real primetime hit,positive
and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the real truman show is clever and welldone,positive
people rejoice,positive
this is the first oscarworthy film of not only this year but of the last five years,positive
not since schindlers list has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well,positive
this is a classic in the making and to borrow a line from esquires review it stars jim carrey,positive
nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank mark my word,positive
for as i said this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre,positive
forget specialeffect ladden summer fodder,positive
drop your romantic comedies in the trash,positive
toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile,positive
you need nothing more than the truman show to carry you through the summer or for that matter the year,positive
oh and in case i dont see you good afternoon good evening and goodnight,positive
leonardo decaprio whats eating gilbert grape and claire danes tvs my so called life star in director baz luhrmanns modernized version of william shakespeares classic romeo juliet,positive
surrounded by a superb supporting cast including paul sorvino goodfellas brian dennehy tommy boy pete poslethwaite the usual suspects and john leguizamo executive decision decaprio and danes shine throughout the film,positive
the story starts off at a gas station where the montague boys meet the capulet boys and square off with one another,positive
symbolizing the swords of shakespeares day were their weapons like the rapier9mm or the longsword shotgun,positive
instead of killing each other right away they shoot around just like in sword fights of old,positive
another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeos best friend,positive
mercutio who in shakespeares novel was quite a stud was portrayed as an africanamerican crossdresser whose violent nature was a definite plus,positive
miriam margoyles a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliets nurse even though she was never given a name,positive
she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world,positive
verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeares version only slightly changed in luhrmanns,positive
now known as verona beach the capulets led by sorvino and montagues led by dennehy are now rival corporate dynasties,positive
and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars,positive
one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue since it was spoken in old english,positive
subtitles could have helped in the beginning of the movie but toward the end it became easier to understand,positive
this excellent movie poses another problem what genre is it,positive
romeo juliet contains so much drama yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories,positive
with the same awardwinning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction romeo juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece,positive
meet joe black reviewed on nov 2798,positive
starring brad pitt anthony hopkins claire forlani,positive
in meet joe black brad pitt plays death,positive
thats all that really needs to be said but nevertheless i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description,positive
death decides to take a holiday what with all the rigors of soulcollecting and all and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what its like to be human,positive
death assumes the body of brad pitt and from there much trouble ensues,positive
for one thing deathaspitt falls in love with hopkins daughter played by claire forlani,positive
obviously this enrages hopkins because really what can death offer,positive
besides eternal damnation of course,positive
there is also a subplot about forlanis exboyfriend she dumps him for pitt trying to take over hopkins company,positive
meet joe black runs just under three hours,positive
ive always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics,positive
meet joe black is neither historical nor is it an epic though i get the feeling martin brest the director desperately wants it to be,positive
every single scene in the movie goes on about 34 minutes too long,positive
and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should,positive
a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent instead of just good which is what it is,positive
pitt an actor i normally loathe is actually quite engaging as death,positive
i believed his performance and i could see why forlanis character would fall in love with him,positive
i have to agree with roger ebert though who found it hard to believe that an entity thats been around for all time wouldnt know what peanut butter was,positive
that has nothing to do with pitts performance of course but it is a little distracting,positive
hopkins gives his usual excellent performance,positive
hes able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left without making him an obnoxious whiner,positive
and in her first major studio role claire forlani is surprisingly good,positive
she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her,positive
so meet joe black is a good movie hampered by its ridiculous running time,positive
had the film been cut by an hour or so i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review,positive
the film magnolia can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests,positive
the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower,positive
they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart,positive
the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially,positive
from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain,positive
they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness,positive
whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one,positive
magnolia is a clever well thought out film from prodigy directorwriter paul thomas anderson of boogie nights fame,positive
the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make magnolia memorable,positive
however what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories the film is never confusing,positive
andersons control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful,positive
he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of magnolias scenes drag on too long,positive
any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending,positive
from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesnt get boring,positive
it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot,positive
this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation,positive
every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees,positive
for example cop john c reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through halls daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly,positive
the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes races and genders suffer,positive
andersons explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing,positive
the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously,positive
this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get,positive
the performances in magnolia are perfection,positive
this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting,positive
anderson allows many of hollywoods best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best character acting,positive
all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film,positive
worth noting is tom cruise who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance,positive
he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillons character as phillip baker halls wife,positive
she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film,positive
magnolia uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters,positive
anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours,positive
to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity,positive
diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time,positive
i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future,positive
accepting his oscar as producer of this years best picture winner saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over,positive
one could almost say the same about his muchprized film,positive
rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery symbolism ideas and metaphors complex and literate storytelling all possessed of an intelligence that invites even demands constant scrutiny an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth,positive
in short the antithesis of all things hollywood,positive
yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind,positive
ralph fiennes is the title character an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory and particularly the memory of love is the ostensible focus of the film,positive
but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him,positive
his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld,positive
the same can easily be said for every other character in the film of which there are too many,positive
juliette binoches nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart,positive
at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious disfigured dying stranger,positive
even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion however that it verges on the comical,positive
with so many characters enjoying so little screen time the films 160 minutes can be taxing,positive
yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldnt help but feel that greatness was in the air,positive
hints of it were everywhere in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modernday swimmer in the sahara in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war,positive
there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years,positive
but ultimately the emotional truths writerdirector anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed,positive
in the end i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron a haunting bore,positive
bore is perhaps too strong a word,positive
but after drinking in the rich production values the cup remains only slightly over halffull,positive
the tailor of panama is a different kind of spy movie,positive
despite the presence of pierce brosnan there is nary a hint of james bond flash here,positive
instead of big action scenes leering super villains and emptyheaded femme fatales we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation,positive
based on the novel by john le carr who also cowrote the screenplay the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year a solid welltold story,positive
brosnan plays andy osnard a british operative walking on thin ice,positive
his british superiors ship him off to panama making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement,positive
osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new coworkers and his new home base,positive
when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that since the creation of the panama canal the structure is the sole connection between north and south america he barely keeps from yawning,positive
brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end,positive
searching for a way to get information on the government osnard sets his sights on harry pendel geoffrey rush an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite,positive
harry claims to be a transplant from britains renowned saville row but osnard knows his secret the tailor is an excon who served five years in prison after torching his uncles shop in an insurance scam,positive
he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm,positive
osnard offers harry a way out,positive
he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele,positive
eager to comply harry offers what he knows then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing,positive
before long he is forced to spy on his loving wife louisa jamie lee curtis an aide to the canal director,positive
harrys little lies build eventually taking on a life of their own,positive
osnard turns in reports about the silent opposition a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal,positive
the bogus revelation proves explosive leading to meetings in washington d c over how to best protect the vital waterway,positive
meanwhile osnard wallows in his newfound status enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive coworker,positive
and harry grows ever more fretful fearing the consequences if his clients not to mention his wife learn about his lies,positive
geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor,positive
rush makes harry a credible figure presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity,positive
after gaining fame playing larger than life characters rush flips everything around for this role using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems,positive
although she gets far too little screen time jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her,positive
of the central characters she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine selfconfidence,positive
curtis is one of my favorite female actors whiplash smart sultry and charismatic she deserves more than supporting roles,positive
speaking of supporting characters there are some great ones here,positive
harold pinter is amusing as harrys uncle benny who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways,positive
also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr strangelove school of armed patriotism,positive
but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson both outstanding as two wounded activists,positive
their presence adds weight to the story reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal,positive
director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location,positive
instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there,positive
the metropolis described by one character as casablanca without heroes pulsates with life underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people,positive
the tailor of panama succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment,positive
as fairy tales go cinderella has to be one of the most famous,positive
almost everyone knows it well at least in north america,positive
so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it,positive
it has been done before with varying results,positive
this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time,positive
the basic story remains unchanged but one thing that seems to vanish with this version and that is all the fantastical elements of the story,positive
there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature,positive
after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least,positive
unlike in the fairy tale the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end,positive
the prince who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france meets cinderella known as danielle on a few occasions most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her,positive
although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling,positive
the story takes place in a renaissance setting in france with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion,positive
this addition of leonardo da vinci was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical,positive
for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired,positive
for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that,positive
especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne,positive
the characters of danielle cinderella played by drew barrymore and that of the evil step mother played by anjelica huston are well developed and well played by the two women,positive
although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable,positive
the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie,positive
as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique,positive
but anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly,positive
the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable,positive
the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise,positive
all in all this movie takes you back into history into a seemingly magical fairy land,positive
but dont get me wrong there is nothing but reality it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening,positive
so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing,positive
strange days chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles,positive
as the locals gear up for the new millenium lenny nero ralph fiennes goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips,positive
he pines for his exgirlfriend faith juliette lewis not noticing that another friend mace angela bassett really cares for him,positive
this film features good performances impressive filmmaking technique and breathtaking crowd scenes,positive
director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it,positive
but as a whole this is an unsatisfying movie,positive
the problem is that the writers james cameron and jay cocks were too ambitious aiming for a film with social relevance thrills and drama,positive
not that ambitious filmmaking should be discouraged just that when it fails to achieve its goals it fails badly and obviously,positive
the film just ends up preachy unexciting and uninvolving,positive
perhaps its time for me to say a little about my reading habits,positive
i really do like to read and ive enjoyed many books in my lifetime,positive
my problem is that im a slow reader and not very dedicated ill enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time its taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina even though im loving the book,positive
in addition to this i typically dont read anything created after the 19th century,positive
the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting time after time that i havent read any of the books on which these films are based the only exception i believe is great expectations,positive
however i dont think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film,positive
needless to say i havent read the elmore leonard novel out of sight on which steven soderberghs new film is based,positive
i cant say how faithful of an adaptation it is or if it lives up to leonards vision,positive
i can say that its a terrific film with sharp acting great dialogue and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh,positive
its certainly a nice distraction from 1998s lineup of brainless blockbusters all hopelessly wishing that size mattered,positive
out of sight proves that it doesnt,positive
i had originally written george clooney off as a onenote actor incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair,positive
after seeing his latest performance in this film ive changed my mind this guy can act but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those 20 million superstars,positive
here he plays jack foley a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living,positive
he does it because its fun i think but the film opens with him getting caught because his car wont start,positive
he goes to jail which is interesting only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend buddy ving rhames,positive
were then introduced to karen sisco jennifer lopez a u s marshall who conveniently is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes,positive
fortunately they take her hostage and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety,positive
the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible,positive
we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence and since this is a gritty crime comedy flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise,positive
at first i kind of felt that it was a gimmick but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction too,positive
its a fun gimmick though and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally,positive
ive only seen a few of soderberghs films i was impressed both with kafka and sex lies and videotape but i think hes excellent at what he does,positive
hes an artist without making it obvious and without being pretentious which is always admirable,positive
he uses tricks yes lots of freezeframe stuff here but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film,positive
as i said clooney is terrific and hes matched by lopez,positive
lopez is of course beautiful but she can act too,positive
i can sense that shes honing in on her skills for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome uturn,positive
the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another the best scene in the film by far is the seduction scene,positive
the brilliance of this scene is also due in part to soderbergh for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later,positive
the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances layered upon light dialogue and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema meaningful and engrossing,positive
the supporting cast is strong led by the alwaysreliable ving rhames,positive
dennis farina who plays karens father is good as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain,positive
steve zahn who plays jacks nearlybrain dead accomplice glenn steals all of his scenes and thats in a film where every scene is already at a high level,positive
all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligentlyconstructed script by scott frank,positive
out of sight is certainly a light film although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory,positive
overall i can recommend it simply as great entertainment,positive
not every film has to change your life and its nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers,positive
as for the book this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at,positive
oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with,positive
in a perfect world a civil action would be a breath of fresh air,positive
its cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isnt,positive
its romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham isnt,positive
and the capper it has no distinct ending and the law in hollywood films is that above all else you must have an ending,positive
even if its based on a true story a true story which hasnt yet ended you must supply an ending a false one but an ending nevertheless,positive
hell a civil action is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together and that includes the firm the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic,positive
yet its also oddly and slightly unsatisfying,positive
weird,positive
this is in fact a steve zallian film not just the work of a hack and zallian is the director of the muchadmired search for bobby fischer didnt see it and writer of none other than schindlers list,positive
in short i like this guy and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories,positive
after all apart from the obvious itsaholocaustfilm and itsaspielbergfilm isnt schindlers list just a damn brilliant film not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study,positive
a civil action is the same way its narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study,positive
and its here that the film seems to go a bit wrong,positive
the main complaint of this film is that while yes its an engrossing lawyerly tale it has no real ending and thats not necessarily the problem with the film,positive
its that its just kind of unsatisfying,positive
if this were a great film it would feel complete and still end basically the same way,positive
but this film just seems to end and i dont want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on imagine if you will being one of those the film is about looking forward to this film and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter just so the many wont bitch about what is essentially genuine,positive
but the fact that it just ends is not in all actuality what is wrong with it,positive
its rather that zallian has chosen in the last half hour to adandon the traditional lawyer story and chose the other part of his story the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta whos shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant because hes manipulative and he always wins,positive
it wishes to make it all about jan in the end but the truth is his change although nicely done is not full,positive
we see him suffering from a personal crisis and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart but in the end we dont fully believe it,positive
and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision the film choses an odd angle to go at a noble one but one that gives the films conclusion that of incompleteness,positive
in the opening of the film we see him doing his old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases,positive
in short hes full of bullshit and we know it,positive
in the film he takes a case that is hardly desired a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river,positive
point one its not of the usual criteria jan points out wickedly that dead or wounded children arent nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success,positive
point two it has been through several lawyers,positive
after turning them down jan changes his mind a muddled scene he stops his car on a bridge looks out is he feeling a sense of overachievement and he and his team of lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek and accountant william h macy head out to the town to do battle with the towns company,positive
they spend millions of dollars examining the land test the water what have you this is where stephen fry a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in wilde pops up thanklessly and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children and then unsuccessfully the workers at the plant,positive
they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company the eccentric jerome facher played by robert duvall more on him later on,positive
as we progress we get so involved in the way the story is being told which is engulfing everything around it including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begins to have a personal crisis,positive
things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half as they are up against impossible odds the judge john lithgow is not only a strickler but a pal of facher the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify no concrete evidence is being found depsite the money spent to find it and they are quickly running out of money,positive
as macy mortgages everything he can including their homes and their office he slowly loses his sanity his meatiest role since oh fargo and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist,positive
in fact the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par owen gleiberman especially criticized the film for not being overlydramatic i,positive
suppose like a grisham novel,positive
this wouldnt be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good hes seen as being still full of bullshit,positive
because he doesnt take stock in the cares of his partners and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out,positive
the final half tries to redeem this as must have been the point of making this in zallians mind but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when hes seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him and thusly receiving two speeding tickets we still feel that the big change in his life is that hes not rich and esteemed anymore the films final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow,positive
the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case its still going on you know but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has,positive
we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life,positive
it only feels like half of that,positive
maybe even less,positive
and its not travolta who does a great job here though never to be a truly memorable performance of his but rather zallian whose final chapter needs a rewrite,positive
up to then though its an engrossing drama one of the best of the year in fact and one of the best lawyer films period,positive
the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted but rather its about the lawyers the knights who battle eachother,positive
we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town but the reason it cant be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find,positive
and duvalls facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that its almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is,positive
facher is seen as an elderly man a goofy eccentric carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it eating lunches out of paper bags and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio and scold anyone who interupts him,positive
but look deeper and you see a master at work his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him and its difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way,positive
thats why i liked this film its hard to put a pointer on,positive
you can never see exactly where this film will land and even when the credits roll you still arent sure what to make of it,positive
call it the zallian effect,positive
same thing happened with schindlers list not that im comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman,positive
each film is so greatly crafted that you cant help but get involved in its broad storytelling interesting characters and most peculiarly the wit that comes along with it,positive
if only it felt totally complete like say schindlers list though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two it might have been one of the best films of the year and along with that a full breath of fresh air,positive
it was only a matter of time before a dilbertesque office comedy hit the screens,positive
however rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams office space is instead based on the work of another animator mike judge creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill,positive
in his liveaction directoral debut judge aptly spoofs corporate culture,positive
the story is certainly not very involved but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps,positive
peter ron livingston is a programmer working at the initech corporation,positive
every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before in,positive
other words every day is the worst day in his entire life,positive
hes stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors all obsessed with administrative trivialities,positive
hes smitten with joanna jennifer aniston a local waitress but hasnt the guts to even introduce himself,positive
everything has simply made him a complete nervous wreck,positive
but all of that changes when after an unintentionally overeffective visit to a hypnotherapist peter loses all of his inhibitions,positive
he realizes his lifelong dream to do absolutely nothing,positive
he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss bill lumbergh gary cole doing whatever he feels like,positive
peters friends and coworkers samir ajay naidu and michael bolton david herman no,positive
not that michael bolton are perplexed by their friends sudden change in attitude,positive
but they have larger things to worry about rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing,positive
as bleak as much of this sounds let me assure you that office space is a comedy and quite a funny one,positive
although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life,positive
each mundane detail taken by itself seems completely regrettably plausible,positive
yet when combined into a whole the picture which results is absolutely surreal,positive
ron livingston tackles his role straightfaced and becomes much funnier because of it,positive
his character isnt simply being a clown lampooning around the office but rather seems possessed by a zenlike clarity,positive
he is operating on a higher plane where everything suddenly makes sense and from this vantage point he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life,positive
anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film,positive
in fact in addition to being wildly humorous the film may actually prove to be cathartic,positive
the animated roots of office space show in the films lack of complexity,positive
most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk,positive
one employee milton stephen root is practically a fleshandblood cartoon,positive
however despite their simple nature the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny,positive
its not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film though the situations may seem exceedingly farfetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are,positive
the film is flimsy and absurd but also very funny,positive
the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings,positive
involved in these tests is hank marshall jones an army colonel who is critical of the aboveground tests that are being done,positive
he urges belowground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own,positive
marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly lange who is topless on the bases beach in full view of the entire personnel,positive
hanks reaction is one of amusement,positive
hes been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how,positive
the problem is carly is a manicdepressive and when she isnt flirting with any man who happens to be near her shes fantasizing about a fictious world where shed rather be,positive
typical of the mental illness she also is promiscuous and foultempered,positive
the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable,positive
from hanks reports which state his opposition to the armys methods of testing he is transferred from hawaii to alabama,positive
carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe bleachblond and all,positive
the new home in alabama is pretty rundown and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum,positive
after meeting his new commanding officer booth hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat,positive
carly openly flirts with the co hank tries to deal with the situation but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool,positive
arguments ensue,positive
the family becomes even more alienated,positive
the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers much to the vocal objections of hank who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb,positive
back at home the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father cant deal with their mothers problems,positive
one daughter says hes blind and shes crazy,positive
the other answers theyre perfect for each other,positive
it reaches the breaking point when the older girl locane and a boy the cos son odonnell see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed,positive
she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open,positive
hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives including the cos wife snodgress,positive
he confronts the c o,positive
but not about carly,positive
he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing,positive
a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife,positive
hank is arrested,positive
what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation,positive
instead they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope,positive
he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters,positive
carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time,positive
the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems,positive
the performances are solid throughout,positive
jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wifes rage,positive
he comforts her and offers protection,positive
lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family,positive
amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should,positive
blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family,positive
the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling,positive
the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991,positive
he had made such classics as look back in anger 1958 and tom jones 1963,positive
orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years,positive
the film joins an alread promising fall lineup of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone,positive
based on the relatively unknown in comparison to spiderman marvel comic book blade tells the story of halfvampire halfhuman played by wesley snipes who was born of a vampires latest meal,positive
now swearing vengeance against all vampires blade hunts them all,positive
his latest challenge is his biggest though he,positive
must stop the vampire deacon frost played by stephen dorff from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires,positive
admitedly comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums often viewed as juvenile by most standards even seen as illiterate by some,positive
judging by a series of poorly recieved financial and critical comic book based films such as batman and robin steel barb wire the crow city of angels and the list goes on one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film,positive
to some degree i agree with this sentiment,positive
having read comic books since the age of nine im 21 right now i can count the number of good comic book based movies not including japanese manga one hand 1 the crow 1994 2 batman 1989 3 superman 4 the mask and now 5 blade,positive
men in black is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book,positive
why is this,positive
for the most part it is because the filmmakers understand,positive
the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match,positive
the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere which the director provided,positive
the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics which the casting and cg effects reflect,positive
superman,positive
is not over the top with colour and flash and the film reflects this,positive
blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film creating an appropriate atmosphere,positive
this is in stark contrast to joel schumachers contrived vision in batman and robin reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960s television show,positive
batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact comics have grown up and so has the audience im working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when im ready,positive
which brings me back to blade,positive
although he may be a familiar character to some due to his appearances in the spiderman animated show on fox one will find no single trace of the warmandfuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon,positive
the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that,positive
uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends,positive
the end results are not pretty by any means,positive
the story elements work very well for a comic book story,positive
screenwriter david goyer who also wrote the crow incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films,positive
this is presented through karen a hematologist portrayed by nbushe wright,positive
this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires,positive
add this,positive
to the neat little gadgets that blade uses including a titanium sword complete with an antitheft device and one has an interesting premise,positive
however the film works best as an action film,positive
actor wesley snipes has,positive
an extensive background in martial arts most of which comes from capoeira a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks choreographing every single move,positive
proving that quick flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences see batman and robin for a,positive
good example of that wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes,positive
regardless this film is far from perfect,positive
the film suffers from at least one major plot hole regarding the summoning of the blood god,positive
the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on,positive
marked squares yet one of them is viciously murdered allowing the ritual to pass and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square,positive
obvious continuity errors also surface especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame there is no trace of smoke either,positive
much of the special effects are not that spectacular either,positive
while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch other cgi computer generated imagery effects are almost slapped together which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released the films release date was pushed back multiple times,positive
scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake knocking the believability factor down a few notches but then im really hard to impress,positive
the films r rating comes from gory violence but the lack of,positive
realism made me wonder why it got such a rating for realistic violence,positive
watch saving private ryan,positive
the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi,positive
still scenes involving noncgi special effects do surface and look much more impressive such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blades sword without deactivating the antitheft device,positive
wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess,positive
while not talking much he is a grand physical presence leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust,positive
a decent by comic book film standards storyline also helps,positive
this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city of james camerons most heralded film titanic,positive
postponed from last summer with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history this was one film i was eager to preview,positive
so is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday,positive
my best guess it will sink though with many awards attatched to its hull,positive
no doubt titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made,positive
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date,positive
to see a ship fall apart with actual people running across the ship flying across the deck and falling to the water is just amazing to look at,positive
the effects are so stunningly realistic you would swear you were looking at actual footage,positive
but titanic is more than a disaster movie and thats where the problem lies,positive
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise,positive
ill give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you,positive
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic,positive
we see actual footage of the sunken ship as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor,positive
bill paxton leads the expedition in search of sunken treasure,positive
what he finds instead leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage,positive
we meet rose kate winslet a young woman who comes from an upperclass family,positive
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love,positive
we meet jack leonardo dicaprio a young man who comes from a poor financial background and wins a ticket aboard the titanic in a poker game,positive
the two meet under interesting circumstances and the love story begins,positive
add in a jealous fiance and a notsonice law officer played by david warner and you have a story that well gets a bit overplayed and oversappy,positive
i must add at this point that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates as a woman with new money who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship,positive
she is a pleasure to see on screen,positive
when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 40 into the film and eventually sinks you never really feel for any of these characters,positive
the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on,positive
the effects are tremendous,positive
from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room to a doomed ship cracking at the seams this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other,positive
we saw titanic in dolby digital surround and by far it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen,positive
my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard,positive
when people are in the water at films end you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles,positive
titanic runs far too long,positive
the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length,positive
and while most of the first 2 5 hours runs very fast and wellpaced the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends,positive
dont get me wrong about titanic its,positive
not a bad as i am making it out to be,positive
it really is an exceptionaly wellmade film,positive
the costumes and sets are incredible and true to the time period,positive
the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form as we see actual pictures of the modernday wreckage transformed into the movie depiction,positive
this film will certainly win on effects costume set design and sound,positive
cameron has certainly made his best film to date,positive
unfortunately titanic is not a best picture candidate,positive
it just doesnt have a strong supporting story,positive
its an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside,positive
it just doesnt have the emotional impact that i suspect mr cameron was shooting for,positive
i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews,positive
it is a film worth seeing,positive
i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office,positive
with its extreme running time and lack of enough robust to get substantial wordofmouth i expect that it will do even better on home video,positive
this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts,positive
titanic opens december 19th and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth centuryfox,positive
i give titanic 3 stars,positive
thats not bad,positive
ron epstein,positive
riginally posted in home theater forum,positive
gattaca represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of sciencefiction films its a genre picture that doesnt rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story,positive
the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction,positive
this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color intelligence and life span theyd like for their child and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects,positive
those made the oldfashioned way are labeled as invalids and confined to the lower rung of society,positive
vincent freeman ethan hawke is one such person born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dishmolded younger brother anton,positive
fed up with being secondrate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation,positive
everyday he watches as superior folk make his fantasy a reality,positive
determined to do the same vincent meets a dna broker tony shalhoub in a funny cameo who sells fake identities to invalids,positive
his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow jude law an exathlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life,positive
for a price and the promise of a caretaker jerome supplies vincent with his identity as well as blood skin and urine samples for all of those pesky onthejob tests and physical examinations this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card,positive
because of his drastically improved status vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca and catches the eye of comely coworker irene uma thurman on the way obsessed with her own minor heart defect shes enamored by his flawless persona she doesnt know is a lie,positive
but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure the mission director is murdered,positive
two ardent detectives alan arkin and billy bathgates loren dean determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca and the sole clue they find at the crime scene one of vincents eyelashes threatens to blow vincents cover and derail his goal,positive
even if gattaca were dramatically empty it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials the films look is dazzling without ever being flashy,positive
firsttime andrew niccol he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama the truman show demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy retro ambiance,positive
an opening credits sequence where skin nail and hair fragments fall in slowmotion through a colored camera lens displays these combined talents uncannily,positive
niccol even utilizes voiceover narration a device almost always poorlyemployed in an effective way,positive
when it comes to acting the movie is also flawless,positive
ethan hawke does magnificent work proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level,positive
his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side but needfully so adding to the settings clinical chill,positive
as the bitter jerome jude law has a starmaking presence and its his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core,positive
in gattaca s series of final shots the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other and the effect is sad lyrical and beautiful,positive
things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax when vincents relationship with his brother comes back into view,positive
the big dramatic culmination is a swim race which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed,positive
still the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop its successful scifi without showy special effects its a crisp thriller with characterdriven thrills its a futuristic fable without blood and guts,positive
even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage,positive
although its portrayal of the upcoming century is grim gattaca serves up one of the most thoughtprovoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film,positive
for this review and more visit clear illusions www clearillusions com,positive
the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music worn out dialogue such as ill be right back or simply with the overall tone of the scene,positive
how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change,positive
thats the kind of bursting originality that allows final destination to invade the viewers mind even days after seeing it making one pause before ever entering a dark room taking a shower or even going to sleep,positive
the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996s scream,positive
final destination directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick glen morgan and james wong the latter two being writers for the t v,positive
series the xfiles is a movie with wonderful ideas and executes them effortlessly,positive
its rare a film of this nature can grab an audiences attention these days as the genre has seem to be completely worn out but final destination has more in store for one than one can imagine,positive
unlike halloween s michael myers or nightmare on elm street s freddy kruger final destination s killer is of the supernatural the dark one himself death,positive
the intriguing premise is as follows a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip,positive
after boarding the plane one of the students alex browning devon sawa dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff killing everyone on board,positive
once waking up alex gets himself and six others off of that plane all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening,positive
shortly after their departure the plane takes off and guess what it blows up in middair,positive
now alex and fellow survivors who consist of friend clear waters ali larter enemy carter kerr smith carters girlfriend terry amanda detmer the goofy billy sean william scott and his brother tod chad donella and teacher ms valerie lewton kristen cloke are in extreme danger as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane and now death wants them,positive
the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane but who is next and how will death get them,positive
final destination is a film that is unbearably suspenseful always making the viewer frantic as death will strike in the most unlikely of times,positive
john denvers rocky mountain high being played pretty much warrants another death everyone on that plane learned the hard way,positive
although its usually given whose life will be taken next the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades because you dont know when death is coming,positive
like the characters in the movie i was constantly nervous and shaky during final destination,positive
the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air and yes the film is that intense,positive
the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par the best ensemble in this genre since scream,positive
the characters have multidimensional personalities for a change and for the most part you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way,positive
devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances that like the scream movies did for their cast will launch them into superstardom,positive
kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive although the two dont posses as much screen time as the leads,positive
final destination is one exhilarating exciting ride,positive
any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack,positive
for the blood loving moviegoer destination contains buckets of blood guts and all that good stuff,positive
final destination is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans and a sleeper hit at the box office,positive
hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me,positive
by scare i dont mean making me jump or making me wonder if im in danger but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind absorbing you leaving one question thats constantly on your mind is death coming for me,positive
the bottom line make final destination your destination,positive
insane but inspired musical about alferd packer the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america,positive
as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer trey parker supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold,positive
throughout packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse a tribe of ute indians that doesnt seem quite on the mark and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism,positive
parker obviously knows his musicals very well because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film he would accomplish this again in his postcannibal,positive
musical motion picture south park bigger longer and uncut,positive
apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre south park parker and stone in their first effort cannibal,positive
also offers up some pretty decent laughs,positive
the aforementioned ute indian tribe that packers group encounters is a definite highlight as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen one of which ends on a comedically deadly note,positive
stones humphrey character steals the show especially when complaining about the prospect of having to eat butt or revealing whats underneath his muff cap,positive
jason mchughs character of mr miller is the stand out performance though as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings,positive
as i mentioned before parkers songs are very catchy,positive
youll be hard pressed to get its a shpadoinkle day out of your head once youve heard it incidentally the braniff logo that appears at the end of every south park episode is scored with a few notes from this song,positive
other songs youll find yourself humming include when i was on top of you a love ballad the trappers song the villains leit motif and hang the bastard the rousing finale,positive
thankfully none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park bigger longer uncuts songs are,positive
released as a pickup through troma studios the film is available on videocassette and dvd,positive
the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball,positive
there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films,positive
as for the dvd,positive
well thats a different story,positive
probably one of the best dvd packages of the year and potentially of all time cannibal,positive
the musical,positive
the dvd is a massive achievement,positive
presented in 1 33 1 full frame only the disc has the usual troma inclusions the tour of troma the troma intelligence test 2 trailers for upcoming releases but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal,positive
specific extras,positive
the first thing i must note is the transfer is about as beautiful as any ive ever seen on any disc,positive
the picture is crisp clear and free from any noticeable artifacts,positive
add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard featuring trey parker matt stone jason mchugh dian bachar and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still havent scratched the surface of the extras,positive
theres also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film a clip with trey matt and lemmy of the band motorhead from the film terror firmer an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film and finally an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal,positive
its good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves,positive
kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time,positive
disneys 35th animated feature a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with well the superman story is surprisingly soft at the center,positive
great wit great art and a great villain james woods as hades lord of the underworld and local lounge act cant quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero his colorfully monotonous sidekick danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil and a largely unremarkable soundtrack,positive
none of the alan zippel tunes are particular ly noteworthy,positive
some lack lyrical snap,positive
others need more memorable melodies,positive
boring ballads we expect but boring production numbers too,positive
so hercules is a bit of a long sit but you wont stay bored,positive
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action herc battling a cgi hydra a steady stream of anachronisms somebody call ixii and pop references lets get ready to rumble a la aladdin and several longoverdue jabs at the mouses marketing and merchandising depart ments,positive
while not as rocksolid as hunchback its a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas,positive
directed by ron clements and john musker with voice credits including tate donovan susan egan bob goldthwait matt frewer samantha eggar paul shaffer and as lighting bolt zeus rip torn whos having a very good summer also appearing in trial and error and men in black,positive
the thirteenth floor the third in what i would call the reality check movie series is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz,positive
all three made you think made you wonder what is real what isnt and if our world is just a huge game,positive
the thirteenth floor doesnt reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives a great shot at it,positive
in the matrix we were told that the humans are simply a virus,positive
in existenz we learned that our life could be just a game,positive
in the thirteenth floor we learn that we are just electronic devices living under another world of electronic devices,positive
there is just one world on top of another and everything in them are fake and electronically generated,positive
the thirteenth floor took a huge risky turn that i didnt expect it to take and im not very sure it was such a great turn to make,positive
rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds,positive
after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller played by armin muellerstahl douglas hall played by craig bierko a man that worked under fuller for many years must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using to the year 1937 which consists of computer generated characters only,positive
the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days,positive
all of the people involved are just characters or are they,positive
douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours and killed fuller,positive
along the way douglas interacts with many different potential suspects and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller jane fuller played wonderfully by a talented young actress gretchen mol,positive
the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going and doesnt use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewers interests,positive
i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz and i wouldnt enjoy it but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film,positive
unfortunately many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened,positive
the scenes that arent original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere leaving you wondering what is the point of this,positive
sometimes it was hard to believe that this story with terrible dialogue some bad acting especially from craig bierko and scenes that go absolutely nowhere are actually true,positive
i know this isnt a true story or anything but a film should be able to make you think that it is,positive
on the plus side of acting we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor armin muellerstahl,positive
in the thirteenth floor he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances,positive
another plus is gretchen mols realistic performance creating her character with depth not just staying in the onedimensional phase,positive
dont expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile and shuts you down like any other movie would,positive
thrills chills and spills arent what you will get in this film but you will just get another trip to send your mind on scrambling it until youve had enough,positive
the bottom line lets hope this is the last of the reality check based movies for awhile,positive
in the sweet hereafter atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living,positive
he shows us how it isnt dying that hurts but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings,positive
on a cold winter day in a small isolated town in british columbia a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake where it cracks through the ice and sinks,positive
fourteen children die and numerous others are hurt,positive
for the residents of this small town all of whose children were on that bus it is an earthshattering event that resolutely alters their lives,positive
they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle,positive
alberta and risa walker who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ian holm to bring a lawsuit against someone anyone for responsibility,positive
the bus driver dolores driscoll gabrielle rose is a kindly woman who loved the children and although she lives with a burden of guilt is not held responsible for the accident,positive
the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice and there was nothing should could do to prevent it,positive
however according to stephens there are no accidents in life and someone will pay for this tragedy whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through,positive
he goes through the town approaching the parents who have lost children asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger,positive
and for his work stephens will receive onethird of the settlement money,positive
however it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money,positive
he is driven by something else something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents,positive
he has lost a child too but not in the same manner,positive
his daughter zoe caerthan banks who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite has been in and out of drug rehab clinics and detox stations for ten years,positive
she calls him on an irregular basis begging him for money but refusing to tell him what she needs it for,positive
i dont know who im taking to he tells her,positive
in his mind his daughter is dead,positive
the lawsuit is to stephens not only a way to mend the towns pain but also his own,positive
however not everyone in town wants it to happen,positive
billy ansell bruce greenwood who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children wants nothing to do with it,positive
he has already lost his wife and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman,positive
he doesnt want to talk about the accident and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds,positive
to him the town should be able to take care of its own pain and it doesnt need outsiders like stephens getting in the way,positive
central to the sweet hereafter is the tale of nicole burnell sarah polley a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into a wheelchair girl as she puts it,positive
aside from stephens nicole is the most complex character in the film and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out,positive
it is also her sad haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack reading robert brownings poem about the pied piper and how when he led all the towns children away one was left behind because he was crippled,positive
obviously nicole is that child and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the towns children left her alone by dying in the wreck,positive
her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving but incestuous relationship with her father tom mccamus,positive
there is only one fleeting scene that suggests this relationship but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film,positive
of all the storylines in the sweet hereafter this is the most complicated and unresolved although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film,positive
egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers if any at all and he doesnt condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up,positive
what egoyan has done in the sweet hereafter is really nothing short of miraculous,positive
in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life,positive
egoyan has always been a talented but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold,positive
the sweet hereafter is quite the opposite egoyans stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion and draw the audience into the tragedy,positive
the sweet hereafter seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked,positive
the film is filled with beautiful subtle performances from all the actors especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind,positive
the beautiful roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting melodic musical score by mychael danna both previous egoyan collaborators give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements,positive
like his earlier films egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole,positive
he works with time as a fluid substance shifting back and forth between the past the distant past and the present with effortless ease,positive
the actual bus wreck itself doesnt happen until midway through the film but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail and still have it carry great devastating weight,positive
because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple direct terms,positive
certainly one of the best films of 1997 the sweet hereafter is a deeply rewarding mystifying and ultimately human film,positive
books could be and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy and rightfully so,positive
this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70 80s inspiring literally dozens of clones from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre,positive
the special effects were groundbreaking revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later,positive
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it,positive
and now george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy,positive
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now,positive
some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterdays star wars updated with todays special effects wizardry,positive
either way the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen where it rightfully deserves to be seen,positive
can there be anyone in the world who doesnt know what star wars is about,positive
in a way star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it,positive
its a story about a young mans coming of age a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire a tale of swashbuckling and derringdo the likes of which havent been seen on the silver screen in decades strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world,positive
its high adventure incredible special effects and well its just an experience,positive
something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation and,positive
its about to do so again,positive
this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the films devoted fans who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now,positive
interviews trailers leaks from within lucasfilm all of these have been collected collated and placed on webpages for people to see pages such as http www islandnet com 4 html,positive
or my personal favorite http leopard cs latrobe edu aukoukoula,positive
pictures of before and after have been placed side by side even,positive
months before the movies were released fans were making comparisons,positive
in some cases the changes were nothing less than phenomenal and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater,positive
the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original,positive
for instance in my personal favorite example the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep mosscovered carvings and etchings,positive
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling booming city with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing,positive
all the starships and fighters are now computeranimated getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally madeand they look fantastic,positive
four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldnt do it justice,positive
however much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself,positive
the negatives badly damaged by the ravages of time were brightened and returned to their original splendor,positive
the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt into glorious booming theatershaking fullthx dolby digital stereo,positive
and that more than the added scenes or new special effects is where the real value of this new version lies,positive
its really true what they say in the commercials star wars loses so much on the small screen,positive
even letterboxing doesnt make up for the decrease in size and definition,positive
in regard to the star wars special edition and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released ill make this final recommendation go and see it,positive
go and see it more than once it,positive
may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after its gone this time,positive
take along the youngsters whove never had the bigscreen star wars experienceyoull enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time,positive
theres magic in this moviespecial edition or no there can be no denying that its still star wars and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages from four to four hundred,positive
lets all return to that time long ago and that galaxy far far away,positive
plot a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes,positive
he is taken prisoner along with some other humans and tries his best to escape his simian captors,positive
oh yeah and did i mention that the apes can talk,positive
kewl,positive
critique despite this film not looking like a tim burton movie or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun summer fare,positive
although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape makeup jobs and characterizations,positive
i mean i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real,positive
i also have to give it up to all of the actors inside the costumes not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get makeup slobbered all over them for 24 hours but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well,positive
i especially enjoyed bonham carters performance who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film human or ape and tim roths bad guy who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part,positive
plotwise i liked the beginning of the film the whole buildup once wahlberg got into the village the escape and most of the fight scenes but once things got out into the deserted area and the final battle sequence i kinda lost a bit of my interest,positive
i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of human beings as animals then i was about the end battle sequence which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film,positive
i also hated the kid character who just got on my nerves and didnt really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved i wont ruin it here but cmon guys you,positive
coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that no,positive
but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his interspecies love interests,positive
this dude didnt seem to give a rats ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didnt really care about what happened to him either,positive
now im not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script but the film suffered because of it,positive
visually the movie was also nice to look at especially the apes but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton,positive
the surprise ending that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 felt a little tacked on here and despite being interesting didnt really make all that much sense to me unless you look at it from a sequel point of view,positive
so overall i loved the whole feel of the planet the apes that ruled it the manner in which they treated the humans screamed shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain but didnt appreciate the films lack of human character development why was kris kristofferson even in this movie and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring,positive
but i would still recommend this film as a fun summer movie with laughs creepiness and a really cool premise,positive
ps for anyone who has seen the original i cannot believe that they didnt at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character in this case mark wahlberg goes nuts at the world in which hes suddenly been thrust this is a mad house,positive
type of thing,positive
the guy in this film barely seems to be put off by the fact that hes surrounded by apes who can speak english,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
the arrival 810 battlefield earth 710 godzilla 410 instinct 610 mission to mars 310 pitch black 710 1968 planet of the apes 910 sleepy hollow 810,positive
this dumb cowboy blondie who thinks he is a darn good loverboy decides to leave his dusty ol town somewhere in texas and go to new york,positive
he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach,positive
when he arrives to new york he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best darn stud in the wholo new york city,positive
obviously he fails,positive
he meets the cripple rico dustin hoffman who is terrifically good in a bar,positive
rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down so he walks in a peculiar way,positive
rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this rich dumb cowboy,positive
he cheats our cowboy out of 20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears,positive
soon our cowboy runs out of money he gets kicked out of his hotel and starts getting hungry,positive
walking through the city with everybodys talkin playing in the background oh and his prided techno transistor radio in hand he spots rico in a cafe,positive
rico halfscared pours out all the money in his pocket,positive
60 filthy cents,positive
our cowboy hungry is forgiving,positive
he is glad he found someone he knows,positive
rico offers to make it up for him,positive
and he invites him to his place,positive
and what a filthy cold place it is,positive
our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the junk bed,positive
when he finally wakes jumps,positive
up he finds rico looking at him,positive
you wanna cupacoffee,positive
rico asks in his friendly sleazy somewhatchildish manner while he smokes on a ciggy,positive
whatre you,positive
a goddamn faggot,positive
what do you want from me,positive
where are my shoes,positive
what did you do to them,positive
but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded,positive
rico really has a heart,positive
together they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death,positive
rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees,positive
but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida,positive
we will soon be in miami is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking moving end of a film it is,positive
the classic theme music midnight cowboy helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film,positive
whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable,positive
ive always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable death and taxes,positive
oddly ive never given much thought to either of the two,positive
maybe if i did at least id stop getting collection notices from uncle sam,positive
yes let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping hold on to all my receipts and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistakefree and will keep me from incurring penalties,positive
it seems that the issue of death may not be so different at least envisioned here in this film,positive
as this tender love story goes if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty,positive
the dreams wishes and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true,positive
for those who die with a burdened soul however they wind up in that other place,positive
chris and annie a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer,positive
their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable,positive
but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annies happiness,positive
and when chris dies after a terrible car accident she commits suicide a tortured soul who blames herself,positive
despair is perhaps the greatest sin and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity,positive
chris on the other hand has made it to heaven and upon learning of annies fate he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare,positive
this film brims with imagination containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell,positive
it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares,positive
its shape and look is as infinite as our imagination,positive
as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous he also begins to learn more about himself,positive
certain questions baffle him at first,positive
why does his home in heaven ooze with paint,positive
what is the significance of the asian stewardess,positive
why does he have an alltoowilling guide cuba gooding jr to help him find annie,positive
but as he slowly begins to realize the answers it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie,positive
dreams is both visually and tellingly beautiful,positive
alas i have one regret,positive
the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying,positive
it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments,positive
however your eyes will still well up with tears and youll find lots to savor,positive
the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed,positive
the journey is imaginative,positive
and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film,positive
earth is a harsh unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent,positive
people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets indian and pakistani muslim hindu sikh parsee,positive
the story takes place in lahore which was indian before partition and pakistani afterward regardless of what its citizens might call themselves,positive
the action is seen through the eyes of lenny maaia sethna a young parsee girl but it is really about her nanny shanta,positive
shanta has a small circle of male admirers,positive
two of the men are suitors hasan rahul khanna a hindu and dil navaz aamir khan a muslim,positive
the otherssikh hindu muslimare older some are married but all appreciate shanta who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das,positive
she also starred in deepa mehtas previous film fire the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water,positive
in an early scene the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears,positive
one of the men remarks jokingly that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along,positive
he is wrong the men make barbed little comments to each other spoken like jokes but with an undercurrent of fanaticism,positive
the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses,positive
it is easy to perceive in these squabbles the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter,positive
the group around shanta represents in a sense a united india and shanta herself the ideal motherlandone which all love which inspires hindu muslim and sikh to live peacably together,positive
but the circle around shanta is sundered as is the state,positive
a sikh is persecuted hides then flees,positive
another man is murdered,positive
the group of friends will not meet again,positive
the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction a plate shattered on the floor a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child and most brutally when the tension escalates into violence a man is held down tied between two cars and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles,positive
it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully,positive
the crux of earths plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz,positive
his sisters are killed in brutal fashion by hindus because they are muslim,positive
dil navaz seeks solace from shanta and asks in desperation that she marry him,positive
but she loves hasan and tenderly refuses dil navazs offer,positive
the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate,positive
despite the things he later does it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things,positive
the conclusionthe consequence of dil navazs transformationis rather abrupt,positive
the story earth tells does not end,positive
it just stops,positive
it is an appropriate finish giving us closure would have imparted at least on an aesthetic level a sense of resolution of satisfaction,positive
but there was no resolution for india and pakistanthey have been at war on a small or large scale for decades,positive
since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus,positive
there is no healing to be had no closure on any level despite the needless tackedon ending with voiceover narration from lenny as an adult framing the story,positive
earth is in some ways an unexceptional movie,positive
it does not reinvent the wheel following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas,positive
but deepa mehtas directon is assured and the issues she addresses run deep,positive
earth does for india what movies like zhang yimous to live and tian zhuangzhuangs the blue kite did for china they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history,positive
such films strike me as inherently valuable even when flawed,positive
they may be biased or inaccurate but they bear the weight of human hardship and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other more inventive films often lack,positive
it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries the events shown may have happened decades ago but they still touch a nerve,positive
the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year,positive
in the near future india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other,positive
at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen after seeing earth i have a much much better understanding,positive
what is a scary movie anyhow,positive
is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds,positive
is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge,positive
possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer,positive
what ever happened to horror movies where the horror was in the atmosphere and in the characters,positive
movies like halloween and psycho which revolutionized horror genre forever but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty entitled the exorcist the movie opened to rave reviews and scared audiences to death now in the year 2000 the exorcist comes back to the big screen in a version youve never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending,positive
chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan,positive
while working on a new film chris still stays close to regan but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden,positive
when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon she shuns at the fact of it but considers getting a priest to help her daughter,positive
father karras jason miller is the man they bring in his mother has just died and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl,positive
christ father karras and their nanny sharon kitty winn have to sit and wait until a man shows up that man is the exorcist and that man will help this little girl,positive
excrutiatingly scary the exorcist is a classic horror film which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death,positive
now we get to the experience the exorcist the way it was meant to be seen in a directors cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time a new ending has been added as well and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie which i prefer the original darker ending more,positive
the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix and is amazing,positive
the voices are all clear the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness,positive
as a director friedkin has been well known for other films but his standout film is the exorcist nominated for several academy awards it one a few but was somehow doubted best picture best actress ellen burstyn and best supporting actress linda blair who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl alone possessed and unable to stop what is going on,positive
ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date and can be seen currently in requiem for a dream to which she is getting rave reviews for,positive
jason miller jason patriks dad is amazing as father karras and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along,positive
i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie i in no way think that this movie is comical yes some of the stuff regan says is funny but they were laughing at her head spinning and the green pea soup come on people this is some creepy stuff,positive
anyway the rerelease of the film has managed to make 40 million dollars and is still going,positive
hopefully one day they rerelease it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy,positive
aggressive bleak and unrelenting film about an interracial couple steve and sam damon jones and elexa williams respectively who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads,positive
the skinheads beat steve then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again,positive
when sam kills herself later that evening steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson,positive
waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely steve shaves his head dresses in combat boots and suspenders tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols and tries to infiltrate the gang,positive
as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence,positive
randolph krets script based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the films producer shaun hill is an affront on violence and intolerance,positive
the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one cant help but be disgusted by the events presented within,positive
ive seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been but david finchers film was trying to define a generation,positive
krets film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one,positive
if fincher is the kubrick of our generation then kret is our d w,positive
griffith thematically speaking,positive
there is not a single likable character in the film,positive
the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury not just against other races but within their own circles,positive
the africanamerican characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost,positive
even gay men get in on the act locating the skinheads lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects,positive
the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge,positive
what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society,positive
the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable,positive
damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors cant seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful,positive
his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriends suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film,positive
david lee wilson who plays appropriately enough david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads,positive
wilsons character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly,positive
sadly actor dave ward who portrays the character of crew will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage,positive
ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed,positive
note it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism,positive
the message about hatred couldnt be spelled out any more clearly than it is here but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation,positive
there are no winners at the end of this film either,positive
no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began,positive
where american history x had redemption for most of its characters no such victories are in store for pariahs band of twisted souls,positive
it is this bleak ending that carries the films most powerful message the message that despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest evil will still be with us and in many forms and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely,positive
every once in a while when an exceptional family film comes along i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children it is remarkable how many nondisney films disappear in a couple of weeks,positive
now i see that in so doing i have unfairly ghettoized these films,positive
so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents but to anyone who wants to support smart funny energetic filmmaking see matilda,positive
see it in a theater rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video,positive
see the best film i have seen in 1996,positive
not the best childrens film the,positive
best film,positive
period,positive
based on a story by roald dahl it tells of young matilda wormwood mara wilson an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents harry danny devito a crooked used car salesman and zinnia rhea perlman a simpleminded bingo addict,positive
the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists and when they do it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books,positive
when they finally do send her to school it is to crunchem hall a bleak place run by cruel childhating miss agatha trunchbull pam ferris,positive
but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher miss honey embeth davidtz who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness,positive
matilda also discovers another special talent the ability to move things with her mind which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbulls cruelty,positive
it was this springs james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda,positive
and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton matilda soars on the cockeyed direction of danny devito,positive
devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses and he contributes some memorable images,positive
in one scene an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pigtails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer later an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert,positive
matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale,positive
it is also characteristic of the best childrens tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost dont realize that they are learning them,positive
there is a hilarious moment when matildas televisionaddicted father snatches away the book she is reading in a wicked joke he thinks moby dick is pornographic and forces her to watch an inane game show hosted by jon lovitz in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around,positive
matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child that because im big and youre little im right and youre wrong,positive
more specifically it has as its heroine an intelligent selfconfident girl who struggles successfully against other peoples notions of how she should behave,positive
it is no coincidence that matilda was cowritten by robin swicord who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women,positive
finally matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word,positive
devito knows enough to make matilda fastpaced and appealing to children taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy including a great chase through her dark house,positive
the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character,positive
but there are also many many delights for adults including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matildas classmates recite in singsong fashion there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matildas father,positive
i cant imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted,positive
matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling,positive
i will see it again and years from now i will watch it with my children,positive
and now i will stop because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin and there is a seat in that theater you should be in if you have a child or ever were a child,positive
the deer hunter directed by michael cimino is truly one of the greatest movies ever made,positive
a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russianamerican pennsylvania community the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget,positive
in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 outstanding performances are turned in by all actors and ciminos brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the characters lives,positive
the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together,positive
michael portrayed perfectly by robert de niro is shown early on as the natural leader of the group,positive
after a days work the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar where john george dzundza works,positive
three of the men michael steven john savage and nick christopher walken will be leaving shortly for vietnam but not before steven gets married,positive
after the marriage the group including axel chuck aspegren spend one last day on a hunting trip one of their favorite pasttimes,positive
this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war,positive
the wedding scenes although criticized by many as being quite long actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act,positive
the outstanding performances by de niro walken streep savage and cazale who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future,positive
the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong,positive
the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river,positive
this prison run by the v c,positive
initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other,positive
steven who is emotionally marred by this turn of events is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate,positive
michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other and moreover they must play with 3 bullets in the gun,positive
personally i felt that de niros absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes,positive
the men are eventually able to escape but are separated,positive
michael is able to get steven who ends up losing his legs to medical care while nick finds his way to saigon and a u s army hospital,positive
michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero,positive
he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him,positive
he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam,positive
the third act concentrates more on walkens character who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is again russian roulette,positive
only in this game you play for money,positive
michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him,positive
the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home,positive
a very emotional and for many a very disturbing movie the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed,positive
the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors and ciminos directing which is considered to be at his alltime best in this film is equally dazzling,positive
do not miss this film it will captivate and astound you,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
james tobacks return to directing after a eightyear layoff two girls and a guy is a film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blakes absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and a great deal of dialogue,positive
embracing a near realtime approach this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering characters,positive
fortunately the films cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing,positive
the films setup is fairly generic in nature and opens rather unpromisingly,positive
we meet selfpossessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside a soho loft,positive
as they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that theyre both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport and it doesnt take long for them to come to the realisation that theyre being twotimed by the same guy,positive
more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blakes loft and await his arrival for a confrontation,positive
its when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride,positive
played with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights,positive
its fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the films best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others but by his own innate behaviour,positive
whether hes flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother its never less than wildly entertaining and insightful,positive
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a oneman show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin to fly,positive
one of the great touches in the film is how blake when startled by carlas unannounced appearance begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cats out of the bag,positive
doubleteamed by the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasinglyflustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even selfrighteous declarations against their verbal jabs,positive
surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was offlimits for this film,positive
however itd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lous outrage to full featurelength and its as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel,positive
the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the films tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat,positive
subtle and notquitesubtle allusions are made a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale,positive
one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla,positive
two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter longrunning dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene contractuallyobligated to deliver an rrated film mr toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaleddown versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc17 rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the films thematic narrative is rather dubious,positive
if anything two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film,positive
he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled from selfassured to disconcerted yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered,positive
its a wonderful performance in a role customtailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr downey jr was arrested on drug charges and its hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blakes selfchiding to get his shit together is disquieting in its resonance,positive
while mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actresses are solid in more broadlyobserved roles,positive
ms graham is quickly becoming one of americas more daring actresses involving herself in three successive risky projects two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman,positive
shes quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry,positive
meanwhile ms gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing,positive
she tones it down substantially as the film progresses but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox,positive
the film was reportedly shot in eleven days filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout,positive
two girls and a guy has an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one senses that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors,positive
while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesnt feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is wellused to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner,positive
two girls and a guy falls short of its potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr its still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly as we watch the surprisinglyresilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends,positive
im an actor he tells them at one point using the ol triedandtested occupationalhazard defense,positive
actors lie,positive
but not they all seem to agree denzel washington,positive
as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell there is a wonderful eyecatching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film,positive
the shot has tibbs face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars,positive
to see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film,positive
as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin,positive
the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous,positive
this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds,positive
it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film,positive
in the heat of the night was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america,positive
jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental,positive
in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers,positive
he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present,positive
preceding the very original a soldiers story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters,positive
the film which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted,positive
tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him,positive
as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains tibbs is the perfect protagonist,positive
poitier also gives an excellent noteworthy voice to his character,positive
never nervous and always commanding his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing,positive
however unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance,positive
as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role,positive
he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople,positive
he would refer to tibbs as boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him,positive
as the film progresses though there is a very gradual change in the sheriff,positive
he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors,positive
what i really enjoyed about steigers character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film,positive
he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil,positive
instead it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future,positive
most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes,positive
this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day,positive
jewisons determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate,positive
in the heat of the night shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960s,positive
it displays this perfectly,positive
however the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lacks interest,positive
it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim,positive
there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane police officer sam being a suspect was not needed,positive
also it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered,positive
the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic,positive
a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson,positive
he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood,positive
it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship a green ovular pin and the birth of oscar wilde but if one really strains they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off,positive
wildes philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned loosing his family and his career,positive
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise,positive
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else,positive
and thats why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began,positive
its been said that todd haynes velvet goldmine the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it steals a lot from citizen kane and thats true,positive
in the film a british journalist in the 80s arthur stuart christian bale is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade a fictitious rock star who faked his own death on stage bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement,positive
structurewise this totally steals from kane not only from the setup he interviews three people and the story is a result of their flashbacks but in other things like the beginning death then newsreel and smaller details like the bitter exfriend in a wheelchair and the bitter exwife as a washedup lounge singer found in a bar after hours,positive
this is no kane and it really doesnt aspire to be it doesnt attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like kane did and it doesnt really uncover anything poignant about humanity,positive
instead it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants,positive
the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging,positive
but the 70s scenes are engaging though not to mention addictively campy,positive
they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era and a feel thats so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the thenfootage they become not only a symbol of decadence but of times when everything seemed so simple,positive
instead of creating the world the way it was haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after youve experienced it everything else seems so mundane,positive
theres no outside world to speak of secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack,positive
haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero curt wild and their relationship that created molded and then brought down the movement reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that contributors,positive
blade played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers and wild played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop respectively complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been onetime partners in music but also partners in bed,positive
through discussions with slades exmanager cecil michael feast exwife mandy toni collette reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade and finally expartner wild journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality when he opens up his first slade record he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene finally resulting in leading a boring job in america,positive
haynes demonstrates that hes quite the visual auteur molding scenes that are like long heald breaths such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a concert of them performing a brian eno cover babys on fire with scenes from a decadent drug party and the films most wowinspiring sequence the first concert scene of wild with his band the ratttz where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggyesuqe movements including stripping naked and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent and another slade discovers his idle,positive
even the brief music videos spoofs of bowies have a rare visual flair thats pure camp and which would cause ken russell to drool,positive
the best sequence though may be the beginning following the prelude a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the postmovement era,positive
in it stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet,positive
with brian enos famous needle in the camels eye playing in the background the scene has a detached exhileration the song doesnt seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are,positive
it has a distance thats hard to put a finger on and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair depressingly staring into the mirror it comes off as a nonetooobvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film,positive
this movies not so much about plot but more about the way it is presented making this one of those films which is classified as being style over substance a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack,positive
however for the most part the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world by using his sets costumes cinematography and especially the music to play as characters in his film,positive
the music is especially notable,positive
the soundtrack which is wall to wall consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno trex and roxy music as well as covers by slades band with vocals by thom yorke and occasionally rhys meyers himself and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowielike,positive
the cast is rather impressive but no one really walks away with the film and no performances are extremely good,positive
although eddie izzard as slades manager who challenges slades first manager to an armwrestling match to see who gets control of his career and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly and collette and mcgregor have their moments rhys meyers and bale are noticably subpar neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles,positive
some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes,positive
rhys meyers brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era dying when he turned into a retrogarbo resorting to a life of salingerism and found in the mid70s to be lying around sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl,positive
in fact no one in this film is really seen as a person rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era,positive
bales character is an especially tough sell bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood hes not an extremely personal character and his cliched experiences being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a poof never help us communicate with him,positive
nevertheless rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them and others bitter part of which helps the film work since this is a major piece of eye candy,positive
at the prime of the movie they at least look the role of fashionable leaders slade with his perpetuallychanging androgonys persona and wild with his topless and unpredictable image which clash and fuse into an unstable union,positive
their story of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar whocares attitude crossed with camp is engaging without the personal background,positive
the story of stuart though is a tougher sell because hes the everyman and when you cant totally identify with the everyman your storys in slight trouble,positive
as a cultural rock piece velvet goldmine is rather good but it is merely good,positive
it never totally takes off although it has moments where it absolutely flies but then comes back down,positive
its really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments surrounded by material that could really be much better,positive
the beginning is captivating but slow the middle is fantastic and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that it drags the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion it could probably stop at any point,positive
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths,positive
it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past which is commendable but not totally so,positive
still it does what the oliver stone pic the doors didnt do right becoming very insightful to what happened using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems halfassed i suppose the message is live life but after youve lived it what else is the point when youll be forced to live with regretful memories,positive
the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down,positive
theres some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldnt and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did,positive
lucky numbers is a perfect example of this because its such a blatant ripoff of fargo and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me,positive
i know im in the minority here but let me explain,positive
the film takes place in harrisburg pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter,positive
john travolta plays the local bigshot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards,positive
russ is married to crystal lisa kudrow a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema,positive
shes a selfish nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market,positive
crystals cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ed oneil the tv station manager,positive
she doesnt seem to genuinely like either of them but its all she can do in this onehorse town,positive
much like fargo this movie tells the story of a man whos going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick,positive
he enlists the help of his english friend gig tim roth the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery,positive
along the way a subplot involving a twobit thug named accurately dale the thug michael rappaport gets mixed up in the process,positive
theres also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down,positive
im not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns youre not expecting,positive
this is a farce which is basically a straightforward adultoriented comedy but doesnt go as far as a classic black comedy should,positive
where as fargo was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny lucky numbers is just funny because you cant take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously,positive
its all a big cartoon basically but its funny and i can respect that,positive
travolta is great in his role and even though hes not a really likable character hes trying to be a nice guy despite the fact hes a creep,positive
hes like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill,positive
crystal is just the opposite shes constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself,positive
kudrow is perfect in this role since shes spent 8 years on tv as the dimwitted phoebe on friends,positive
here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe,positive
i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money,positive
like jackie brown an elmore leonard adaption the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally,positive
the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus,positive
more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do,positive
the ending itself is great,positive
its surprising and funny and makes you feel good,positive
you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies worth of stories into two hours time and didnt fall apart although many other critics might beg to differ,positive
i liked it and i could see it again isnt that what makes a movie good,positive
confession time i have never ever seen gone with the wind,positive
i dont know why really,positive
havent wanted to check it out on video havent been at home the nights it was on network tv and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the bigscreen,positive
so right up front ill admit that i dont know what the heck im talking about but here goes,positive
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990s,positive
maybe thats going a little bit too far,positive
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie theyre no clark gable and vivien leigh,positive
but,positive
the parallels are there,positive
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available technicolor,positive
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors,positive
gwtw places americas greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story titanic does the same with the atlantics most legendary tragedy,positive
they both have strongwilled redheaded heroines they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the bums they were both incredibly expensive and popular,positive
ok maybe thats not enough parallels,positive
so titanics not in gwtws league,positive
no matter,positive
titanic is a great movie in its own right complete with spills thrills and especially chills,positive
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again,positive
the money was obviously wellspent,positive
the costumes look great the sets look great the cgi graphics look great,positive
i especially liked the expensive little touches like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks,positive
but producer james camerons real challenge in producing titanic wasnt just costuming and set design and special effects,positive
camerons major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in,positive
he succeeds masterfully,positive
cameron does two things that work incredibly well,positive
first he shows us modernday salvage operations on titanic thats just titanic not the titanic mind you,positive
the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton,positive
television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101yearold rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck in 1912,positive
stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew,positive
secondly cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character and the romantic triangle between rose winslet her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio,positive
the way that bigbudget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an allstar cast so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people,positive
cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board,positive
the supporting cast is professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown theres no moment when you stop and say oh yeah i know him whats he been in,positive
although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform or even as the illfated engineer,positive
the love story itself is rather conventional,positive
i think some reviewers found it weak and that may be a fair criticism,positive
the performances are the key here,positive
zane has the meatiest part in the movie and he plays the arrogant condescending steel millionaire to the hilt,positive
hes smooth he looks great in a tuxedo and hes a convincing enough jerk that the winsletdicaprio relationship looks plausible,positive
at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat you can hear the wheels in his mind turning saying not can i save this little girl,positive
but can she help me get on a lifeboat,positive
dicaprio is a revelation,positive
i hadnt seen him before in anything and didnt know what the heck to expect really,positive
honestly i expected a bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game,positive
dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive and being on the titanic that its hard not to like him,positive
from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest and he never falters,positive
winslets character grows up a lot during the movie and so does her performance,positive
at first shes not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look dropdead gorgeous,positive
we know from the narration that shes monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane but there isnt any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio,positive
winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg,positive
its at that moment where winslets character really comes alive,positive
faced with real danger she drops her spoiledrichgirl mannerisms and does a splendid job,positive
as rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cals fiery temper winslet turns in a superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror,positive
of course the most interesting character is the ship itself,positive
cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic and shows her in every mood as a deserted wreck down in the boiler room up on the bridge down in the hold at the captains table down in steerage and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead,positive
camerons greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well,positive
the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and real movies,positive
consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste,positive
topflight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety,positive
based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks the movie represents a rethinking of the storys structure not merely a literal adaptation of the novel,positive
told in linear form by four narrators in the book egoyans version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator,positive
the author is even on record as applauding egoyans changes,positive
in the press notes the books author describes the story as a parable of lost children,positive
he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children,positive
picking up on this egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter nicole burnell played with grace by sarah polley reads parts of the pied piper from an old illustrated book to her two charges,positive
periodically throughout the picture nicoles readings are heard in voiceover,positive
you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment,positive
they and the rest of the towns children come into harms way some live and others are seriously injured,positive
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again,positive
although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss,positive
ian holm in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career plays mitchell stephens an intense man of quiet misery,positive
mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small snowencrusted community in the british columbian wilderness,positive
his mission there is a singular one to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone anyone on their behalf,positive
if this seems crass well it is but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot,positive
the story unfolds slowly and always believably,positive
each little aspect has its own fascination,positive
as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson he has a simple task,positive
he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit,positive
wendell ticks off one town member after another and then as one can in a small town enumerates each persons numerous faults,positive
although the town is no peyton place people there do have their foibles,positive
one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell bruce greenwood who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave goodbye to his kids,positive
well single parent billys fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita,positive
his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story,positive
the accident itself a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice isnt shown until the middle of the picture but nevertheless the mystery about it builds throughout the film,positive
although the picture is no detective story finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy,positive
as the injured bus driver gabrielle rose dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning,positive
to round out the story mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear,positive
his daughter zoe caerthan banks is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one halfway house and recovery center after another,positive
fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk,positive
i can help you mitchell tries to reassure billy,positive
not unless you can raise the dead billy snaps back,positive
mitchells pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder,positive
mychael dannas haunting music sets the stage for tragedy,positive
the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur but it is in the warm shadowy intimate moments indoors where it works best,positive
the show which is ripe for emotional manipulation never plays with its audience,positive
still when the house lights go up you may feel as i did,positive
i could barely breathe i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed,positive
more than anything the film is like a master painting,positive
each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint,positive
with the final color in place the masterpiece is complete and the ending credits roll,positive
the sweet hereafter runs 1 50,positive
it is rated r for mature themes sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers,positive
clue is an unfairly ignored comedy very similar to 1976s murder by death,positive
this big screen version of the classic board game whats next,positive
chutes and ladders the motion picture is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue,positive
the plot for what its worth has all the characters from the game in this case the names from the game are used as aliases meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr boddy lee ving the man whos been blackmailing them all,positive
when he turns up dead everyone including the audience must figure out whodunnit,positive
and in what room and with what object,positive
while not as witty as neil simons murder by death clue definitely has it moments,positive
it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when im joking around with my friends,positive
to this day whenever someone says the phrase well to make a long story short i have the follow up phrase too late ready to go,positive
the cast all very good comedic talents play well off one another while the late madeline kahn as the dark and sultry mrs white sometimes steals the film away from the rest,positive
and colleen camp as the french maid yvette displays some of her natural talents as well,positive
clue is available on dvd from paramount home video,positive
it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and features the original theatrical trailer,positive
a french language audio track is also available,positive
the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not and it even includes a scene not in the film itself a scene that should have been in the film as its a good joke,positive
also the trailer is scored to the music from airplane which was an interesting choice,positive
when clue played in theaters it ran with the gimmick of three different endings,positive
if you wanted to see all three you had to go to the movies three separate times,positive
so when the film was released on home video rather than releasing three separate videos all three endings were included on one tape,positive
the first two endings being what if,positive
endings and the third ending being the actual ending,positive
now for the dvd release you get two choices,positive
you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you,positive
note theres an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this,positive
after watching the film with a randomly selected ending when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it,positive
when you do a secret menu opens allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves,positive
now while i applaud the effort of paramount here as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc it just doesnt work well,positive
first why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch,positive
maybe someone like myself whos seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only,positive
im no technical dvd expert but i cant imagine that being too hard to accomplish,positive
secondly the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely dont need a distraction,positive
finally the back of the dvd case states and now with this special dvd version you can see all 3 surprise endings,positive
i have no idea why they would word it that way since thats not a special feature in the slightest,positive
the video has been out for fifteen years now good lord has it been that long and its played on television with all three endings all the time,positive
these are merely minor complaints however seeing that ive watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd,positive
the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy and im thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format,positive
pg,positive
usually when a blockbuster comes out its loaded with effects stars bad scripts and plenty of action,positive
mystery men may contain an allstar cast and efects but the clever script and characters are what really works which is rare to see this year,positive
the film is based upon the comic book series the flaming carrot by bob burden in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime only to be out done by the real hero of champion city captain amazing greg kinnear,positive
things go a little haywire when the sinister casanova frankenstein geoffrey rush is released into the city where he captures captain amazing and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city,positive
well the trio decide to take matters in their own hands by saving the city but first they need some assitance,positive
this is where the film takes a turn for the better,positive
in the beggining there were only 3 wanna be heroes,positive
blue raja hank azaria mr furious ben stiller and the shoveller william h macy,positive
sure they were enterataining but their acts grew old fast,positive
that is until they aquire invisible boy kel mitchell and the bowler janeane garafalo and mr splein paul reubens 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess,positive
thankfully the original 3 heroes become amusing with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen,positive
the whole premise is rather ridiculous but packs a few punches to keep interest,positive
for one the film is considerably clever,positive
it literally pokes fun at super hero films like batman and robin superman etc in fact many scenes are similar to batman and robin including the opening sequence only altered in a humorous and superior way,positive
a part of the cleverness comes from the cast,positive
sometimes a film with such talent is overblown but the acting is what keeps it alive here,positive
while azaria and macy were enteratining 2 characters really stood out,positive
one was paul reuben,positive
no matter how disgusting or revolting mr splein may be you still cant help but laugh,positive
it so incredibly moronic its just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions,positive
janeane garafalo also was an interesting character,positive
she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem due to her enthusiasm that kept the film flowing,positive
men is worth seeing alone for those 2 troubled heroes,positive
on the downside a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off,positive
kel mitchell and geoffrey rush were both utterly useless,positive
their parts were so limited theyd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes,positive
ben stiller too was wasted mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue,positive
none of these characters get a rise out of anybody but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film,positive
as far as the budget goes it was wisely spent on the cast not the effects,positive
while the set designs and action all look nice im glad there was a seperate aspect that the film focused on and for that i applaud,positive
slow at times and rather pointless mystery men still delivers,positive
it forgets about money making because its not likely to make a bundle like its proceeders and thats what works,positive
stupid,positive
maybe but for once im not disappointed,positive
no one expected an intelligent film but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year,positive
the seasoned capt dudley smith james cromwell questions his new protege ed exley guy pearce about his political views when it comes to police work,positive
would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty,positive
would you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved,positive
exley squeaky clean innocent and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed no,positive
stunned smith pleads then for the love of god dont be a detective,positive
la confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s,positive
organized crime was the biggest concern corruption existed everywhere and every cop had his own way of getting the job done,positive
there was hollywood jack vincennes kevin spacey who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell all tabloid sid hudgeons danny devito,positive
sporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat he isnt afraid to flash his tinseltown style,positive
detective bud white russell crowe has only a narrowminded view of the law and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice,positive
and then there is golden boy exley wideeyed and ambitious but extremely naive,positive
a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth action and personal vindication,positive
almost immediately an arrest is made,positive
but something doesnt seem quite right,positive
new developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department,positive
suspicion and questions begin to mount,positive
odd alliances are created,positive
and as layers of the truth become revealed the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment,positive
when the mystery expands we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops including a highpriced hooker kim basinger and a shady millionaire david strathairn,positive
all of the characters levels of involvement are not immediately clear,positive
we watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case,positive
we sense a crosspollination of clues that brings us the audience closer to the truth,positive
we hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery,positive
absorbing and affecting this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir,positive
it boasts mysterious figures in control doublecrosses hard information from sleazy sources dirty politicians corrupt cops haunting women and hardnosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity,positive
the underlying mystery is compelling,positive
the look and feel of the movie is gorgeous,positive
the entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch i wouldnt be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance,positive
and the dialogue is rich and memorable,positive
the best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do,positive
dont start trying to do the right thing boyo says he,positive
you havent had the practice,positive
l a confidential triumphantly achieves the rare gift of complexity and coherence while satisfying our desire for a good oldfashioned movie,positive
on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements in case you missed it warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail,positive
he says to a black congregation if you cant cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife youre never gonna get rid of me,positive
well there is such a plot and it works very well in this comedy,positive
beatty plays jay billington bulworth a longtime democratic senator from california,positive
the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworths latest commercials condemning affirmative action,positive
the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy,positive
when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv having gone without food or sleep for days,positive
his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care,positive
first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe a 10 million life insurance policy in his daughters name,positive
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination,positive
his assistant murphy oliver platt is oblivious to bulworths suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements,positive
bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an africanamerican church then takes questions from the audience,positive
he is hit hard with questions about his voting record,positive
he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots and it hasnt shown up,positive
since hes a dead man anyway he figures hell answer truthfully he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l a for the photo opportunity,positive
they made some promises that improved their public image for a while and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made,positive
the shock and outrage from the congregation grows the questions keep coming and he keeps shooting back honest if ugly answers,positive
before i go further id like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make and that is that characterizing africanamericans as maltliquor drinking o j,positive
fans is not part of bulworths truth,positive
that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie,positive
when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics this line is not what theyre talking about,positive
the experience is liberating,positive
with nothing left to lose bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth,positive
he can say whatever he wants because hes going to be dead anyway,positive
why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism,positive
bulworths candor wins him three volunteers from the church one of whom nikki halle barry he gets a crush on,positive
he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something,positive
chicken wings appropriately enough,positive
bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives,positive
when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment,positive
with so much money and so many talented people working so hard he wonders why cant hollywood make a quality product,positive
you go warren,positive
when they become indignant and ask why hes talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product he callously admits that its because they are rich jews,positive
that night he drops the three africanamerican volunteers at their nightclub and he decides to go in with them,positive
he stays up all night drinking smoking pot dancing falling in love with nikki and learning to scratch turntables and rap,positive
the next day he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suitandtie fundraisers,positive
from then on at all of his political appearances he raps his political truth,positive
his rap is not bad for a middleaged white guy,positive
hes not very good but it is his first try and at least hes not embarrassingly bad,positive
his lobbyists are not amused but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth,positive
eventually the movies plot remember he hired a hit man,positive
overtakes the politics which is too bad,positive
screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him,positive
there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes bulworth fleeing his killer,positive
these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along but it distracted and detracted from bulworths political ranting which was much more interesting than the everpresent obviouslooking assassin,positive
still most of the movie is original and very enjoyable and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen,positive
as the story and screen writer he came up first with a good structure then with good dialogue to back it up jeremy pikser cowrote the screenplay,positive
as an actor he was able to convincingly portray bulworths depression then liberation and rebirth,positive
as a producer there were four others he was able to keep the movie free from hollywoods indulgent formulas except for those inexcusable chase scenes,positive
someone else probably could have directed but since he was there anyway what the heck,positive
its too bad that there arent more movies like this around movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics,positive
after all much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news,positive
just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants,positive
just dont expect to be popular with the insurance companies,positive
i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david leans war picture,positive
i still think that it doesnt deserve being the number 13 in the american film institutes list of the 100 greatest american movies,positive
and i think that lumets 12 angry men wilders witness for the prosecution and kubricks paths of glory would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958,positive
but i cant deny the importance of the bridge on the river kwai cinematically and in its contents,positive
the film is set in burma in 1943,positive
a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai,positive
but the british commanding officer colonel nicholson alec guinness insists corresponding to the geneva conventions that his officers neednt work as simple workmen,positive
struggling toughly col nicholson forces the japanese commandant col saito sessue hayakawa to give way in this respect,positive
afterwards col nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge,positive
he considers it an opportunity to raise his mens morale and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese,positive
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge among them the american shears william holden an escapee from the japanese prison camp and the british major warden jack hawkins,positive
a flaw of the picture is the clich d characterization of the japanese people,positive
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge,positive
and the film doesnt consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in paths of glory,positive
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies,positive
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col nicholson and col saito,positive
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears who doubts the military logic is a somehow unpleasant person in the film,positive
the audience is supposed to applaud col nicholsons perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not,positive
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col nicholson takes for his men,positive
the plot bypasses these risks,positive
that means the picture isnt perfect,positive
but it has a lot of virtues as well,positive
it shows the madness of war and what war can produce in peoples minds,positive
it shows how col nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others like shears get cynics,positive
and the bridge on the river kwai is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests,positive
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an antiwar film despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme,positive
david leans effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense especially in the dramatic though not wholly plausible showdown,positive
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character,positive
the other actors deliver very good performances as well,positive
jack hildyards fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful,positive
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses,positive
c karl rackwitz klein k ris germany 1999,positive
getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity,positive
the film was directed by randal kleiser who brought us such bubblegum classics as grease and the blue lagoon,positive
but thanks to kleisers surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script getting it right is a pleasantly quiet moving and memorable filmone geared strictly toward a sophisticated adult audience,positive
getting it right stars jesse birdsall emily lloyds boyfriend in wish you were here as gavin a painfully shy 31yearold hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and whogaspis still a virgin,positive
gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon but expose him to a single 30yearold beauty and hes a mess,positive
much to gavins surprise the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan lynn redgrave a rich married and lonely 45yearold,positive
getting it right is the simple story of gavins awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right that is to find the right woman to fulfill his life,positive
getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to indepth character development,positive
gavins selfconscious voiceover narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche,positive
we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and selfconfident maturity,positive
birdsalls superb understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film he seems convincing and authentic throughout,positive
the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavins life,positive
despite her limited screen time redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavins middleaged seducer,positive
for a supporting character joan is unusually and impressively complex thanks in large part to redgraves magnificent performance,positive
gavin is also pursued or perhaps plagued by minnie the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat,positive
after minnie and gavin meet at a party she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life,positive
helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role and sir john gielgud with his tongue in his cheek embodies the height of arrogance as her father,positive
gavins eventual loveinterest is jenny the adorable twentyyearold single mother who assists him at the beauty salon london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character,positive
peter cook the great british satirist appears briefly in the film as gavins uptight employer,positive
the scenes of gavins home life with his parents are also a treat,positive
gavins overprotective mother pat heywood whom even woody allen would find overbearing almost steals the movie,positive
her life seems limited to just two activities treating gavin like a 10yearold and preparing exotic but inedible meals such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce,positive
gavin and his fathers attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing,positive
getting it right for the most part is very wellcrafted except for two minor shortcomings,positive
first the movie is about 15 minutes too long and consequently it loses momentum at times,positive
second the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavins best friend harry and his unfaithful lover winthrop,positive
overall however getting it right is quite memorable for its humor depth sophistication and outstanding acting,positive
director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard adapting her own highly acclaimed novel deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth maturation and selfdiscovery,positive
in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library casablanca was my third classic in some weeks,positive
the others being citizen kane and vertigo yes i am trying to see as many of afis greatest movies ever made as i can,positive
but casablanca stood out from the rest for me it was actually watchable,positive
what most hail as the greatest american film ever casablanca isnt so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in,positive
it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman,positive
that annoyed me as did the ending,positive
why didnt the plan turn around,positive
surprisingly i enjoyed the film,positive
i liked bogarts character and his acting not over the top as most actors in his era,positive
i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie which one would it be and a women said casablanca,positive
at first i was thinking to myself why,positive
then as i watched the film again i understood why,positive
the movie is very well done and the script topnotch although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo,positive
casablanca is in my mind no classic like solaris but it is a good film and stylishly shot,positive
hey hollywood how about this a remake with harrison ford and anne heche,positive
now that would be a classic,positive
director penelope spheeris decline of western civilization ii the metal years dudes suburbia,positive
cast mike myers wayne campbell dana carvey garth algar rob lowe benjamin oliver tia carrere cassandra,positive
summary wayne and garth have a public access show called waynes world,positive
the show is a underground hit until benjamin oliver comes onto the scene,positive
benjamin wants to turn the show into a big hit nationwide possibly destroying the essence of waynes world in the process,positive
expectations medium,positive
long review,positive
i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film,positive
i didnt believe that they mike myers and dana carvey could hold it up for an hour and a half i figured that perhaps the first halfhour would be great and the rest would be fluff,positive
however i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film with the exception of the ending,positive
which i wont discuss for obvious reasons but its not that bad,positive
story the plot was quite thin but it really wasnt that noticeable because of the rapidfire jokes that myers wrote in,positive
alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots in being very parodyish,positive
okay bad term,positive
extremely witty throughout although as in hot shots it got a bit repetitive in the middle,positive
acting as in many comedies the acting isnt really that important,positive
however myers turns in a good performance as wayne playing the character perfectly although i still liked him better back on much music in a more canadian type of mode,positive
carvey is okay as garth but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne,positive
tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra playing it very stilted,positive
lowe is fine as ben oliver but is nothing to write home about,positive
without a doubt this movie is mike myers all the way,positive
direction spheeris is a classic music movie director making dudes and decline of western civilization ii the metal years,positive
she also directed the boys next door which is different to say the least,positive
she is very capable knows how direct a comedy the correct camera movements it instill laughs etc one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy,positive
overall i would suggest to anyone that likes snls skits to go see this film in the theatres,positive
however my personal opinion as in most comedies is that they work just as well on video,positive
you definately have to be fan of music and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film,positive
without a doubt this is the best comedy so far this year,positive
itll make tons o dough for everyone involved,positive
lets just hope they make a thousand sequels,positive
sorry i had to get the lame joke in,positive
forgive me,positive
in brief this film needs no introduction,positive
if you havent heard of it then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical and if you havent seen it well i suspect youre in a small minority,positive
first things first is it all its hyped up to be,positive
well yes and no,positive
its a good film and theres a lot to like about it but its not without its problems,positive
when i saw the first trailer for titanic it was when i went to see bean last summer i think my intial reaction was aint that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful reallife tragedy,positive
i mean whats happened to hollywoods scriptwriters have they run entirely out of new ideas,positive
gads whatever next i asked myself how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme,positive
i was not entirely filled with anticipation but then i wasnt alone in that respect,positive
its when it came out in the cinema to rave reviews well mostly and anyone whod been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice,positive
i didnt see the film until several months after its release by which time my sister had seen it about four times,positive
so i went with a slightly more open mind but i still didnt think id enjoy it much,positive
did i yes and no,positive
mainly yes im happy to say,positive
the first hour or so was beautifully done not so much because of the scripting ill talk about that later but because the recreated ship and sets were stunning to look at as was camerons directing and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the human aspect of the story the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio was enchanting,positive
the film is told via flashback with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day you knew that a course,positive
well its an often effective device to use in storytelling though sometimes it can fall flat,positive
does it work here,positive
in script form it doesnt add all that much to the story,positive
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart whose stunning performance is the strongest most moving of the film,positive
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion and depth to the story and though her appearances are relatively brief the film would have suffered without her,positive
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving,positive
its an old story you know forbidden love ala romeo and juliet but it works and jacks rescuing rose in both literal and figurative senses and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching,positive
in fact i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm energy to the romance,positive
its engaging touching and very enjoyable,positive
theres more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well simply because you know its not going to be a happy ending,positive
which leads us to the second half of the film,positive
we all knew it was coming,positive
im sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it because as hes stated in interviews the real thrust of the story for him was the sinking and the romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film,positive
i think that understates the importance of the romance as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die,positive
the iceberg arrives and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour,positive
and it is an hour,positive
my goodness we dont miss a second of that hour,positive
gratuitous well perhaps not by todays standards im sure theres been far worse produced under the banner of entertainment in other films,positive
but i certainly wasnt prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be,positive
not that id expect the word understatement to be part of camerons vocabulary he who brought us such umm vivid films as terminator 2 and aliens,positive
is it overdone,positive
i thought so,positive
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy,positive
no no one expected a happy ending but i didnt quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the films second half,positive
still whether it was overdone and heavyhanded or not if it was the shockfactor cameron was after it worked because i was shocked and moved in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears,positive
you really couldnt help but get emotionally involved whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of roses overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack or that jack would rescue rose or that they would both survive,positive
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface,positive
the bit where rose lets go of jacks hand while promising shell never let go in her heart was particularly heartwrenching and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image to put no fine a point on it,positive
i loved the ending however which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half,positive
so weve established that the film is powerful and moving if the last hour was rather excessive,positive
havent mentioned the script,positive
plotwise its ok though the relationship was beautifully developed but ive a feeling thats to the actors credit if anything,positive
as for the dialogue well titanic is set in 1912,positive
its a period drama,positive
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned,positive
did they really use phrases like goddamn it,positive
back in the turn of the century,positive
i doubt it,positive
would someone talk like this do ya love the guy or what,positive
i doubt it,positive
is such dialogue as i saw the iceberg and i see it in your eyes now not just a bit clumsy,positive
yes it is,positive
a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray and cameron himself is to blame he wrote the script,positive
stick with directing dude,positive
but its more than redeemed by the acting with dicaprio and winslet on fine form ably supported by a strong cast,positive
star of the show was gloria stuart though why didnt she win that oscar,positive
after all they were throwing oscars at titanic left right and centre but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee,positive
directingwise cameron does a spectacular job,positive
like i said his vision was a bit excessive but at least he directed it well,positive
i havent even mentioned james horners beautiful score,positive
utterly heavenly though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it,positive
ive finished my rant which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would,positive
just leaves a couple of questions was it worth all those oscars,positive
hell dont talk to me about oscars,positive
bloomin farce,positive
it was deserving in a number of departments though,positive
last question is it as some suggest one of the best films of alltime,positive
nope i dont think so,positive
its certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films ive ever seen but i dont think it quite ranks as one of my alltime favourites,positive
and as for the fact theyre reportedly making a titanic 2 well i guess thats typical hollywood for you,positive
jeanluc picard patrick stewart and the rest of the crew of the u s s,positive
enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960s series star trek,positive
gone are kirk spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek the next generation,positive
as usual a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again,positive
this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonists will,positive
it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists,positive
of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists,positive
insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films,positive
the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group,positive
in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction,positive
it doesnt do a bad job other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line,positive
many of the jokes are your typical inside star trekfanonly jokes while many of the others just fall flat,positive
the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense,positive
there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet why do they have to be moved,positive
the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f murray abrahams aliens who number only a couple of dozen,positive
so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion at least thats plausible,positive
but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen which makes no sense whatsoever,positive
the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf michael dorn the trusty klingon,positive
worf was on star trek the next generation so they want to include him in the films,positive
no problem so far,positive
worf is now a character of star trek deep space nine so the writers have to find a way to have him show up,positive
in the last star trek movie first contact the included worf in a credible fashion in this one the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie,positive
what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you werent hanging on every word on the screen,positive
my minor problems with the movie aside star trek insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones,positive
while many of the jokes do miss the mark many are pretty good even for nontrekkies,positive
the special effects are among the best for the star trek series,positive
the action is plentiful and well done,positive
this is a very goodlooking movie,positive
it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek the next generation that the acting is first rate,positive
it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade,positive
they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster,positive
most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series,positive
if youve always hated star trek there is nothing here that is going to change your mind,positive
star trek insurrection is not the best film in the series but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones,positive
note after claiming otherwise my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branaghs hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap,positive
as it happens it didnt take long,positive
is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli,positive
known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968s romeo and juliet required viewing for many high schoolers and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria,positive
last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre one of the twin peaks with wuthering heights of romantic literature,positive
it might seem peculiar then that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen,positive
at first blush hamlet is far removed from romance,positive
the hero though a prince is depressed conflicted and confused,positive
the ostensible love interest gets little screen time and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery,positive
the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus,positive
it is zeffirellis genius however that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace,positive
in this italian masters hands romance is everywhere in a sons worship of his father in the bonds of deepest friendship in the private thoughts of young lovers even in the mystery of castles by the sea,positive
after all the story hinges on a ghost and what could be more romantic than that,positive
what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all namely hiring thenreigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead,positive
who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a lethal weapon in the series of the same name would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language,positive
franco zeffirelli thats who,positive
and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money,positive
what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful not to mention comprehensible,positive
his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed,positive
his movements and gestures excepting his sometimes too active eyes are totally in keeping with the character,positive
this is a hamlet whose pain we feel whose struggle we empathize with and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at films end,positive
glenn close the other big name in the production also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlets mother gertrude though i must confess im still trying to understand the character as written,positive
zeffirellis incestuous interpretation of hamlets relationship with his mother doesnt help,positive
alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy,positive
by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably,positive
of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone,positive
both support the realistic mood marvelously as do the sets and costumes without any overstated effects that declare this is important this is shakespeare,positive
i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due,positive
perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare definitive,positive
and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen,positive
but if youve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard this hamlet is an excellent place to start,positive
for a movie about discoera excess 54 comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club,positive
think of it as a sort of boogie nights lite where that similarlystructured and set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goingson and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift 54 leaves the kinkier details to your imagination,positive
it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter but it thankfully never resorts to preaching either,positive
in fact were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment 54 would be about as feathery as the time periods popular female hairstyle,positive
studio 54 was a haven for the rich famous and generally goodlooking before it closed its doors forever in 1986,positive
inside anything went and we are told everything did,positive
the films fictional main character is shane oshea ryan phillippe the jerky jock from i know what you did last summer a freshfaced 19yearold who dreams of venturing beyond the clubs velvet rope and coming facetoface with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines,positive
his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell mike myers spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in 79 and permits him passage but not before he doffs his hideous shirt of course,positive
once inside shane becomes seduced by the clubs dizzying vortex of sex and drugs,positive
he has such a good time that he doesnt want to leave so he seeks employment as a busboy,positive
he quickly becomes friends with greg breckin meyer and anita salma hayek a married couple who work along side of him gregs a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own,positive
after rubbing elbows among other things with a renowned socialite sela ward and gaining the personal interest of rubell shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54,positive
but fame doesnt come without a price,positive
54 s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players at a slim hourandahalf the film is too short to take on such a multicharacter focus and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act,positive
alleged lastminute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction since 54 sometimes feels like its missing a scene here or there,positive
nowhere is this more apparent than in shanes relationship with soap opera actress julie black neve campbell a frequent studio 54 patron whom hes long admired from afar,positive
the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special,positive
that 54 works despite these limitations then is largely due to the competence and energy with which its assembled,positive
sure its shallow slick sanitized portrait of a bygone age and sure weve seen the ragstoriches story gazillions of times but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision,positive
the film boasts some fine comic creativity the pinnacle of which is disco dottie the wedding singer s ellen dow an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public but slides up to shane behind 54s closed doors and asks for a funky little treat,positive
the solid sexy cast smooths out if only while youre caught up in the film any rough spots belonging to their alteregos or the plot,positive
newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat he and campbell as fetching as ever look so good together its a shame their subplot goes nowhere,positive
meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in clueless he was the stoner with the jokersmile while hayek simply sizzles especially when leading a dance class with the mantra one two three attitude,positive
sherry stringfield unidentifiable under big 70s hair takes on her first bigscreen gig since she left er as rubells accountant but shes criminally underused,positive
as the droopyeyed drugaddled steve rubell myers is worth the price of admission alone,positive
when hes not playing the life of the party the ex saturday night live comedian strips away all of rubells confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty unhappy life with exorbitance its a moment worthy of pity when while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening he attempts to seduce one of his employees,positive
and while his performance is largely serious myers mixes the empathy with a delicate austin powers esque wink thus keeping consistent with 54 s overall feel gaudy largerthanlife and satisfyingly ornamental not unlike a giant disco ball,positive
after the press screening of moulin rouge i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues,positive
everyone seemed a bit numb understandable after sitting through a barrage of oftenincongruous sounds and images,positive
a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it,positive
another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production while a woman who flatout hated the movie gave him the skunk eye,positive
when one fellow quietly stated ive never really been a fan of musicals the statement surprised me because even though the story is told almost completely through song i didnt think of it as a musical,positive
there is so much going on in moulin rouge that musical seems too small a term to cover it,positive
moulin rouge is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience,positive
australian director baz luhrmann the man behind strictly ballroom and romeo juliet fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork opulent imagery and songs ranging from the sound of music to smells like teen spirit,positive
sumptuous and beautiful vulgar and overdone moulin rogue travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the random setting,positive
oh and it has a story as well,positive
it was 1899 the summer of love,positive
christian ewan mcgregor is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris to write about truth beauty freedom and love where he encounters a group of bohemians led by henri de toulouselautrec john leguizamo,positive
christian meets satine nicole kidman a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor,positive
at once fragile and vivacious the dazzling redhaired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying,positive
christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession,positive
working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler jim broadbent christian writes an opus modestly named spectacular spectacular,positive
zidler quickly finds a backer the wealthy duke of monroth richard roxburgh but theres a catch the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine,positive
as if all that isnt enough satine has a cough and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land,positive
like a teetertotter moulin rogue moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime,positive
one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales,positive
together they dance while serenaded by the man in the moon alessandro safina provides the vocals apparently transported from the classic georges m li s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky,positive
other scenes merely traffic in everythingandthekitchensink overload,positive
the cavorting of toulouselautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy accompanied by cartoon sound effects is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like bewitched beat into the ground,positive
of course sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind,positive
we never heard from baz to turn it down one of the actors told the los angeles times,positive
it was always more,positive
more,positive
the director even sent a note to his cast reading i dare you to make me say youve gone too far,positive
the musical numbers reflect his attitude,positive
one knockout piece the elephant love medley incorporates the beatles all you need is love u2s in the name of love dolly partons i will always love you and elton john and bernie taupins your song,positive
need more,positive
how about diamonds are a girls best friend spiced with portions of material girl,positive
luhrmanns cast offers a wide variety of approaches that together add up to something messy but often wonderful,positive
ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian emphasizing the sincerity of the lovestruck poet,positive
mcgregors singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments,positive
once labeled the ice queen nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling yet tender performance,positive
she handles the songs adroitly although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range,positive
veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler wait until you see him perform like a virgin,positive
as the buffoonish duke richard roxburgh proves to be the films weakest link although im sure he was simply following instructions,positive
i suspect moulin rogue will be one of those loveitorhateit films,positive
while i didnt completely love it i most certainly liked it a lot,positive
over the course of a year i see well over 300 movies and most of them look like xeroxes of each other,positive
moulin rogue is an original and an original even a flawed one is a thing to be cherished,positive
hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death no pun intended honest,positive
its a shame too because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old bmovie monsters,positive
i mean come on,positive
are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour,positive
hell no,positive
and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well not commonly associated with horror films,positive
and not only has the idea been done too many times but with the possible exception of from dusk till dawn has not been done very well lately either,positive
this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu,positive
i got to go back to the times when making movies even horror movies was considered an art form and not just done to make cash like nowadays,positive
and that is exactly what this film is art,positive
ive been a horror fan since i was eight years old and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers,positive
let me backtrack a minute,positive
when i say intellectual ground i dont mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to a little bit of thinking is involved,positive
with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and whatnot you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown,positive
those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen,positive
you see this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore,positive
this is a thinking mans slasher flick,positive
the nosferatu of the title is orlock max shreck a strange hermitlike count that as the film opens is looking for a new home to buy,positive
he employs the help of hutter gustav von wangenhein a real estate salesman or something to that effect who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen greta schroeder,positive
upon orders from his boss hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlocks castle and speak to him about his new home which just happens to be right next door to hutters,positive
the next morning he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck not,positive
really a good sign,positive
he then discovers through some reading that the count is a nosferatu or vampire one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans,positive
but by the time he pieces this together he is too late orlock has already embarked to hutters hometown via boat,positive
will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock,positive
the character of orlock is of course dracula,positive
the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strockers novel,positive
just thought that was an interesting little side note,positive
probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainments digitally restored cut now available in stores,positive
however this version is quite different than maunaus original masterpiece,positive
the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type onegative and color tinting much like the 1984 version of langs metropolis,positive
now i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one,positive
but alas i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen,positive
but thats just my bag you may like the newer more modern version better,positive
either way i suggest investing your money in a copy,positive
if you like what they have done with it pop it in the vcr and enjoy,positive
if youre like me just do what ill do during future viewings turn the color all the way down on your television hit mute turn on some bach or mozart or whatever dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made,positive
an energetic visually stunning but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne darc,positive
in history jeanne darc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors who can basically alter the story as they wish,positive
she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint,positive
a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness,positive
luc besson nikita leon portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft,positive
besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend,positive
he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain,positive
he shows her as a human being,positive
in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky and the air smelled of rotten flesh it is hard to keep your sanity,positive
the only support and hope is in god,positive
at the age of 13 jeanne milla jovovich watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers,positive
this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeannes mind,positive
god is no longer her support,positive
he has become her obsession,positive
she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny,positive
with the help of the wise yolande daragon faye dunaway and charles vii john malcovich whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls,positive
after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo,positive
the movie is filled with dreamy symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere,positive
the film is lost in time and space hysterically jumping back and forth in jeannes thoughts imagination and conscience,positive
bessons visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle,positive
but the film is far from being flawless,positive
the script needs a lot of polishing,positive
except for jeanne there are no real characters,positive
and although a grand star cast is assembled their characters are nothing more than props not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing,positive
as for the maiden of lorraine herself she is portrayed as a simple girl too small for her divine task,positive
in the latter part of the film we see her as hysterical confused and on the brink of madness with her past purity and innocence for ever lost,positive
jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect,positive
but though her screen time is incredible excessive both malcovich being john malcovich and dunaway titus surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance,positive
and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part,positive
besides casting jovovich bessons only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting,positive
there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder pillage and betray with a smile on their faces,positive
and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen represented by the three musketeers of this story the brave gilles de rais vincent cassel the wise aulon desmond harrington and the strong la hire richard ridings,positive
though all those actor perform well their characters are nothing more than symbols banners that proclaim the glory of france,positive
and thus there is no sense of realism in this film,positive
the messenger has muscles instead of brains,positive
there is some relief in the end where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking,positive
dustin hoffmans appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise,positive
jeannes character is unlocked but whether god was in the picture or not is never quite explained,positive
was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge,positive
or was she truly a messenger of god,positive
the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious,positive
bess o messenger is nothing more than a fairly good film,positive
it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater,positive
maybe the sound the dreamy sequences but certainly not the dialogue,positive
it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtvgeneration that although presents some interesting material works better when its on the battlefield,positive
one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable,positive
you know the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is,positive
sure its been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch,positive
this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on overused but always fun,positive
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is but how it goes around giving its story,positive
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls,positive
there is something psychologically stimulating in a wellcrafted serial killer movie and kiss the girls is certainly well made,positive
however the whole film screams of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through,positive
well not only are the actors capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up,positive
unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers one that seven a film a lot like this one knew not to make was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits,positive
that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind i was waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery,positive
however credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film,positive
plotwise kiss the girls shows almost no originality,positive
we are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman a forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero,positive
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself,positive
obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene,positive
at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera has been missing for four days,positive
this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two and as a result we cant sympathize with detective cross,positive
however what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees,positive
before she is abducted,positive
dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is a smart athletic woman and because of these traits becomes a target for casanovawhat the serial killer likes to call himself,positive
because of these characterdeveloping scenes we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful,positive
after being abducted mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods,positive
remembering that the killer gave her certain rules she decides to break one of them by calling out,positive
when casanova comes to punish her she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall,positive
after she is found she begins to help cross find his neice,positive
from this moment on kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive,positive
many people will compare this film to 1995s seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but i presume that the similarities are intentional,positive
the screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet i dont quite see how this story could have worked in novel form,positive
what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness,positive
the cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us,positive
sometimes a simple shot is the best one,positive
however many of the shots are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight,positive
the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way,positive
the camera work is terrific but the editing makes this scene work so well,positive
the chaotic and mtvtype cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judds character is experiencing,positive
however the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors,positive
morgan freeman is one of todays most powerful and believable actors,positive
detective cross is a very good character for him although it is just a similar one to the character in seven,positive
because of freemans powerful presence he carries half the film by himself,positive
the other half is carried by ashley judd one of todays most promising dramatic actresses,positive
in fact her performance is better than freemans if that is even possible,positive
her character is more original than freemans and she handles it wonderfully,positive
we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream,positive
the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast members do as much as they can with it,positive
cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina and unfortunately has scraps for a character,positive
tony goldwyn fairs slightly better but we dont really get to know his character either,positive
gina ravera gives a good performance but again she isnt in many of the scenes,positive
so as a result of all these small supporting parts the weight of the film lies on the two leads and they do a phenomenal job,positive
some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year,positive
two other essential aspects of the film are quite good,positive
director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer,positive
he also doesnt handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have losing a lot of tension during many scenes,positive
however to his credit he does manage a terrific first half,positive
part of the blame falls on david klass,positive
im sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more but klass focuses on the two main parts,positive
while this may give the two leads more screentime many of the small characters are onedimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible,positive
thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girls always seems intelligent,positive
none of the conversations are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced,positive
one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer,positive
i blame this mainly on the casting director because the killers motive is because of rejection from women or so i assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friends is a shall we say big admirer of the killer,positive
kiss the girls is rated r for terror violence language and suggested sex,positive
with all the implausibilities of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain,positive
in fact i had the urge to see it again just for the performances,positive
the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart,positive
this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through,positive
morgan freeman is possibly todays most convincing actor and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt,positive
i must also say that i loved the ending,positive
the showdown between good and evil was quite tense and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer,positive
perhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isnt anyway,positive
ladies and gentlemen 1997s independence day is here,positive
its title starship troopers,positive
and surprisingly it is more entertaining than id4,positive
i realize that i gave last years scifi hit a 4 star rating but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour,positive
after subsequent viewings i feel that independence day really wasnt as great as it seemedthough i still give it a positive review,positive
starship troopers on the other hand has a mocking sense of humor knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem,positive
as a result starship troopers is a more exciting energetic and lively science fiction film,positive
in fact i probably could never get tired of watching this film,positive
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars another kickass space opera which reinvented the scifi drama altogether,positive
while starship troopers is no star wars it comes quite close and the easiest assessment would be to call this film the star wars of the 90s,positive
am i being to generous to this film,positive
perhaps but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring races,positive
in essence this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction,positive
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films and i may have to,positive
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay but director paul verhoeven gives the film a kickthealiensasses style,positive
id4 had this same style except it was forced most likely the cause of will smith having a major role,positive
this new star wars has a very simple basic plot mankind vs an alien species,positive
the alien species in question here is the bugs a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnidtype insects,positive
however the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy,positive
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes but during quiet moments we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization,positive
more than likely these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends,positive
and they should be,positive
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thoughtprovoking film,positive
this is an event film but surprisingly above average,positive
it is extremely refreshing to watch a scifi war film and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved,positive
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange join the army ads,positive
mixing a webbased interface these summations of events are refreshingly original,positive
stating would you like to know more,positive
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor and we know we should not take it seriously,positive
however we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle in a gory yet funny way,positive
after witnessing the slaughter the film jumps back one year to setup what we just saw,positive
we are introduced to johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards,positive
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms,positive
however carmen isnt as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot,positive
however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer has her eye on rico,positive
unfortunately rico isnt interested in dizzy,positive
this setup is rather cliched as is the result of the setup but it still is fun to watch,positive
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper and as a result rico signs up,positive
and as a result dizzy signs up,positive
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy carmen gets the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris a psychic gets a position in the training program and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers the mobile infantry,positive
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships,positive
in reality i found myself watching a space version of melrose place but with better special effects,positive
an hour into the film the war begins,positive
a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with,positive
the first hour may have been a funny sometimes unintentionally setup but we grew to care for the flat characters because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters their gorgeous looks won me over call me superficial if you must,positive
following the training sessions which had many dramas in themselves too many to mention here the troopers are sent to war,positive
the bugs live on the planet klendathu a planet which consists of dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else,positive
many dramas occur during the war until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks,positive
a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense,positive
the troopers are ordered to locate the brain and capture it,positive
i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible because starship troopers is not about plot,positive
its about special effects and gory violence,positive
director verhoeven most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct returns to his scifi days which gave us good films like total recall,positive
verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood,positive
starship troopers is extremely violent with more gore than this years event horizon,positive
the r rating is well deserved and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it,positive
my guess is that verhoevens target audience is the 18 to 25 male group,positive
the film has a testosterone level off the charts with chiseled men and beautiful women,positive
despite these superficial elements starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful,positive
while watching the film we never second guess the characters decisions because they seem perfectly clear,positive
thankfully no hero is punching aliens in the face which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with,positive
the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with but they soon grow on you,positive
casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon,positive
to most guys he will come across as artificial,positive
fortunately van dien is the worst of the cast despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character,positive
dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character,positive
her dizzy is extremely likeable,positive
denise richards also does a good job and her scenes are very well done,positive
jake busey gary buseys son gives a wonderfully funny performance and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film,positive
neil patrick harris remember he was doogie howser is a little wooden and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast,positive
however he does give a good performance,positive
michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm,positive
his performance rises above the rest,positive
perhaps it is because his character is the most developed but i think it is just ironsides presence on screen,positive
unfortunately no particular cast member gives a starmaking performance which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars,positive
director verhoeven is the main star of the film,positive
his direction is fast and unrelentless,positive
he never slows down his pace which makes for a wild ride,positive
writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein,positive
the writing is usually very funny and sometimes very corny,positive
the dialogue is smart but not too smart,positive
we arent required to know everything but some plot holes are left unanswered,positive
thankfully we are not intended to notice and we really dont except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while,positive
amazingly with all the wars and romance going on the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues,positive
in fact these governmental changes seem fairly plausible and this adds another layer to the story,positive
the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage,positive
i havent laughed this loud even in some comedies,positive
oh and the special effects are first rate,positive
starship troopers is rated r for graphic scifi violence and gore and for some language and nudity,positive
believe me when i say this dont take young kids to see this film,positive
it is extremely violent,positive
in fact it is probably the most violent film out this year,positive
however if you are old enough over 17 to see it starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain,positive
its been a long time since i have cheered for the heros while also cheering for the bad guys,positive
and still it is my dream to see a scifi film in which the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world,positive
now that would be entertaining,positive
it is with hesitance that i call apocalypse now a masterpiece,positive
certainly it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease and some of the finest actors of the 1970s,positive
the plot an adaptation of joseph conrads heart of darkness was set in vietnam and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant coming on the heels of the end of the war,positive
apocalypse certainly has its moments some of which are the finest in film history,positive
the plot is fairly simple,positive
captain willard sheen is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty,positive
his mission is simple take a boat up to cambodian territory and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz brando with extreme prejudice,positive
along the way willard runs into a series of adventures including one with lt col kilgore duvall and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies,positive
willard s four person crew finally make it to kurtz compound where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives,positive
willards experiences with kurtz take up the last halfhour with a confrontation and eventual ending,positive
the movie is visually breathtaking,positive
the battle scenes are exquisitely done and the score is brilliant setting a murky mood of darkness that is firstrate,positive
the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening,positive
the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie,positive
the journey to kurtz camp is quite a ride with psychosis setting in on almost every character,positive
the most interesting one is kilgore the lt col who cares more about the surf than about the mission,positive
it is at times revolting psychotic and incredible and it is one hell of a movie,positive
the scenes are bold inventive and powerful and the acting is stunning especially be sheen duvall and fishburne,positive
the narration is exquisite as is the mystery of kurtz,positive
coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam kind of like saving private ryan on lsd,positive
the film is jarring in its implications and psychotic in its execution,positive
the problems come when the film slows down,positive
one of the major scenes in the film where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz is a colossal mess,positive
the dialogue is confusing the lighting is atrocious and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film,positive
the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound,positive
the film slows down to a drag,positive
sheen seems forever captured by a madman played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received,positive
brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes but is bathed in shadows the entire time making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic,positive
the scenes are poorly done the dialogue is muffled and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief,positive
sheen seems to adore this man but why the viewers are never told,positive
the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this godlike kurtz but the scenes fall way short of expectations,positive
granted it has its moments which are brutally horrific but the general feeling is one of confusion,positive
brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir and my feeling was that this could never be a great man this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him so why do they do it,positive
there are moments of brilliance but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene,positive
there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending,positive
the finest scene at the end is sheens escape and his entrace into the temple,positive
his rise out of the water with the smoke coming off of his slicked head is a brilliant 30 seconds of film,positive
yet you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done,positive
the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times and indeed the film on the whole is very good,positive
it is a stunningly flawed expression of film for it addresses major issues such as mans mental stamina during bouts of war,positive
but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful had the character of kurtz been more explored and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for,positive
there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece but it could have been so much more rewarding,positive
for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend there are certain rules that he needs to follow,positive
firstly fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship,positive
secondly buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes,positive
thirdly find the perfect moment and location to propose,positive
finally the groomwannabe should probably get her parents blessing,positive
of these four the last one can be a nightmare,positive
meeting parents is a rite of passage fraught with unexpected questions bouts of nervousness the reality of being disliked and the inability to make a positive impression,positive
if youre lucky things will go smoothly,positive
but if youre greg focker ben stiller everything will go wrong,positive
and with a name like that how could it not,positive
when greg first meets his fianc es father jack byrnes the grimacing robert deniro greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive,positive
when he tells jack that hes a male nurse the incorrigible dad shoots back not many men in your profession huh greg,positive
its definitely not a good start,positive
but greg is determined to win him over and its this desire that fuels the movie,positive
he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner,positive
it doesnt matter that hes jewish,positive
if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace then thats what hes going to gamely do,positive
oh god youre,positive
such a good god he moons,positive
his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle but when jack gives him the deniro squint that familiar unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility its pretty hard not to grin,positive
things get progressively worse for greg,positive
and thats too bad because hes a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart,positive
eventually he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up committing a host of gaffes that embarrass humiliate or injure other people,positive
its a neverending ordeal of missteps miscues and mistakes,positive
he buys some champagne but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances,positive
he tries to find jacks missing cat,positive
but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble,positive
and there are several other episodes each one trumping the next in outrageousness,positive
the more our wellmeaning beau screwed up the more the audience groaned in sympathy,positive
we liked greg,positive
and we liked this movie,positive
meet the parents is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments,positive
just sit back and watch greg get into trouble,positive
no matter what the situation whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house things will horribly go wrong,positive
we laugh at gregs expense but love often makes a person do dumb things and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool,positive
deniro is also affable tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside,positive
their tugofwar is often funny the slapstick is elaborate and there are several topical throwaway gags mostly targeted at the airline industry to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future inlaws from hell,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts excerpt from as you like it act ii scene 7,positive
when william shakespeare penned this passage he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash,positive
this is the world of today and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical highconcept project like the truman show,positive
truman burbank jim carrey seems to have the perfect life,positive
he has a pretty doting wife meryl laura linney a comfortable insurance sales position an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven a reliable childhood buddy marlon noah emmerich except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia this is paradise,positive
or so it would seem,positive
bizarre inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in trumans life,positive
a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky,positive
a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around,positive
a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move,positive
for the first time in his life it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be,positive
the truman show directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol is a remarkably wellconstructed film paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next,positive
balancing drama with humour thoughtfulness with abandon this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy,positive
in many ways mr niccols screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity with pivotal characterdefining moments occurring at sea,positive
although the films rather conventional climax doesnt sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first twothirds and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception,positive
despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film it remains foremost a finelycrafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible,positive
the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false,positive
the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable crowdpleasing underdog vs,positive
the system formula,positive
while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept some elements are lacking,positive
the device of mysterious natascha mcelhone as a contributing impetus to trumans growing awareness isnt exactly convincing,positive
theres not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ed harris with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film,positive
in fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside trumans artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling,positive
still the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city,positive
ive always believed that the versatile ms linney possesses a tremendous comic gift she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing a glazed insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans,positive
cheerfully going over the top its hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that shed have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film,positive
ms linney is a delight in the film,positive
but it is mr carrey who rules the show here,positive
he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal its difficult not to root for truman,positive
in a commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint theres an early scene where hes down on his knees gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gags,positive
its almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down to play a character whos constantly the centre of attention,positive
in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic white picketfenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitzs original score,positive
technical credits are firstrate all around,positive
while the truman show is clearly a definitive highconcept film its not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound ranging from 1965s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner,positive
all the same this is a visionary awardcalibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent,positive
the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous its abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such a scenario,positive
perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question,positive
perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world,positive
the computeranimated comedy shrek is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups,positive
for children it offers imaginative visuals appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces loads of action and a barrage of big laughs including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances apparently a requisite in contemporary family films,positive
for adults its a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids,positive
all in all shrek is a snappy ride although there are a couple of points i found disturbing,positive
but first the basics,positive
based very loosely on a 1990 childrens story shrek follows several momentous days in the life of the title character a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using,positive
shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp until a local nobleman disturbs his peace,positive
petty tyrant lord farquaad take away the awk in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite oneliners owns the land on which shrek resides,positive
he proceeds to turn the ogres yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle,positive
as a result shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice pinocchio the big bad wolf the seven dwarfs and the three bears to name but a few,positive
an enraged shrek storms to the castle only to find farquaad john lithgow ready to bargain,positive
lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from snow white has shown him the way,positive
all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife,positive
the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of the dating game when snow white is shown the cheeky announcer purrs even though she lives with seven men shes not easy,positive
farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona cameron diaz and offers shrek a deal if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragonprotected lava moatfilled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds,positive
shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest accompanied by a motormouthed donkey eddie murphy determined to make the green grump his best friend,positive
they finally hook up with the princess only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet,positive
for the matter the dragon offers a few surprises as well,positive
the movie references a great many other flicks from babe thatll do donkey,positive
thatll do to the graduate,positive
but the lions share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney,positive
the publicdomain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits pinocchio is referred to as a possessed toy and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin he bellows get that dead broad off the table,positive
but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaads royal domicile which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like its a small world,positive
which brings me to disturbing point number one,positive
i laughed at all the disney swipes but found the mentality behind them a bit sad,positive
the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known,positive
for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each others film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day,positive
and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer,positive
heres a suggestion for the two boys grow up,positive
put the past behind you,positive
theres room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads cant play nice then go to your rooms,positive
the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad,positive
beyond all the irreverence shrek actually has a message people should learn to look beyond physical appearances because true beauty lies within,positive
its a lovely notion but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaads diminutive stature,positive
do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable,positive
the pompous selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers,positive
adding short jokes is simply mean,positive
still shrek is a rollicking good time,positive
the computer animation is mostly impressive although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky the voice work is strong particularly from eddie murphy the laughs come fast and furious and the moral tainted though it may be is a good one,positive
to trot out a clich shrek is fun for all ages,positive
parents though should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short tall skinny fat etc is a bad thing,positive
living out loud is the type of motion picture we dont often see it is a film about mature intelligent adults instead of the usual american film in which children basically dress up in grownup clothing and parade around acting like immature sevenyearolds,positive
judith holly hunter a fortysomething living in new york city has been having a difficult time with life lately,positive
she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband martin donovan who had been cheating on her,positive
she cannot sleep haunted by terrible memories often imagines offthewall things to try and make the world seem like a better place and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers liz bailey queen latifah perform at a local club,positive
judiths life does start to brighten a little when one night when she gets home to her apartment late strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator pat danny devito a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently,positive
both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other seeking comfort with the other person but while pat starts to form a deep love for her judith only wants to remain friends,positive
living out loud which was written by richard lagravenese the bridges of madison county who is also making his directing debut here is a wonderful film from beginning to end one that is honest genuinely funny and poignant,positive
the three central characters that of judith pat and liz are all written to be freethinking complex human beings and are all likable but flawed people who are constantly interesting as is the film itself,positive
one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen,positive
sometimes it results in comedy and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching,positive
one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself reading a novel,positive
an older woman comes over to her mentions that that is a great book she is reading and then goes over to join her own friends,positive
as the woman sits down she looks over to see judith by herself and motions for her to come join them,positive
instantly we realize this was simply in judiths mind as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends,positive
holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here,positive
hunter of course was brilliant in 1993s the piano for which she won an academy award but in this film she is even better i think,positive
she finds the right note for each scene and holds it,positive
and devito has never had such a humanistic role before which i was surprised about,positive
usually he is used as the butt of a joke or as a caricature but in this film has a livingandbreathing sympathetic person to play,positive
topping it all off is latifah also a singer who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself and has a juicy natural supporting role as in some ways judiths role model,positive
another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived happy ending but in staying with its realistic tone manages to be upbeat but truthful,positive
the last shot is an especially powerful image,positive
nothing is said but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all,positive
the relationship that results between judith and pat is truetolife and sincere,positive
as we watch these two people talk and get to know each other all that we wish for them both is to be happy even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved,positive
and as living out loud which is one of the best films of the year proves sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for,positive
star wars episode i the phantom menace review,positive
a review by jamey hughton stars,positive
starringliam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman and jake lloyd directorgeorge lucas rated g,positive
with all the hype that star wars episode 1 the phantom menace has been receiving it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film,positive
the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together,positive
can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago in a galaxy far far away,positive
yes this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity,positive
but that doesnt mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment,positive
the phantom menace features the most eyecatching jawdropping visual look in cinematic history,positive
the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest and the special effects are nothing short of the best and most plentiful to ever be caught on film,positive
the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding,positive
the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses even if it has some disappointing aspects,positive
after were treated to the famous prologue in the sky with john williams thundering score we meet quigon jonn liam neeson and young obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor a jedi master and his trainee padawan,positive
they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo,positive
oh but enough about that,positive
the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker jake lloyd into the picture,positive
as you already know this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader,positive
a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter,positive
this particular race is the most exciting energetic highoctane action sequence that youll ever see,positive
one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised and the phantom menace is no exception,positive
i loved sebulba the ratlike scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race and boss nass the leader of the gungans who are a neighbouring species to naboo,positive
one character who has been subject to criticism is jarjar binks a member of the gungan race,positive
jarjar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief,positive
yes he is initially annoying but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless goofy antics,positive
there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses,positive
the final lightsaber battle between the jedis and the horrific and terminally underused villain darth maul is spectacular to behold,positive
jabba the hutt yoda c3po and r2d2 have cameo appearances,positive
lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness,positive
one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments episodes i and ii,positive
when they arrive youll know where to find me,positive
if youre the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland youre going to love the hunt for red october,positive
youll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics or if youre a sean connery or alec baldwin fan or if you admired director john mctiernans earlier films die hard and predator,positive
in fact the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them,positive
the hunt for red october is an epic thriller adapted from tom clancys best selling novel,positive
set in an era before glasnost the movie revolves around a topsecret soviet submarine called the red october,positive
the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection,positive
the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius played by sean connery,positive
ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine but he has other ideas,positive
he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean,positive
is he planning to start world war iii,positive
cia analyst jack ryan doesnt think so hes convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u s ryan played by alec baldwin is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub,positive
the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin but the performances thankfully are rock solid,positive
baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor,positive
sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connerys somber first officer,positive
its ironic to see neil and connery playing russians since they are both best known for their roles as british agents connery as james bond and neil as reilly ace of spies,positive
the large cast also includes scott glenn james earl jones tim curry and joss ackland plus richard jordan as the smooth u s national security adviser,positive
the special effects are remarkable but more than anything the hunt for red october is distinguished by its watertight plot,positive
screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns,positive
they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment,positive
the movie doesnt get as sweaty or breathless as die hard because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with nonstop action,positive
the finale is rousing and suspenseful but essentially the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler,positive
i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set unless im watching a movie,positive
i dont even have cable so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching the xfiles every sunday night,positive
its the only show thats worth an hour of my time each week though since i dont watch reruns im glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether,positive
i am an avid fan of the show and have been for about three years now,positive
and i love gillian anderson,positive
the xfiles is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off,positive
the film is like a twohour episode except that there are a lot more special effects the plot is thicker and the resolution is more satisfying,positive
this is a terrific film both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment,positive
i expected to like it more than any episode ive seen and my expectations were met,positive
actually the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices but thankfully the makers managed to do it right,positive
when the finale ended the fbi branch known as the xfiles had been destroyed and our heroes mulder david duchovny and scully gillian anderson were left stripped of five years of hard work,positive
the film picks up soon after and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building,positive
but wait im getting ahead of myself,positive
the film actually opens in the ice age about 32 000 years prior during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien,positive
the aliens blood infects them fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer and the story jumps into modern times during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer,positive
it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy and mulder and scully uncover the coverup despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi,positive
soon they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens,positive
as ive written before its not easy to write plot summaries for films like this because everything needs to be a surprise,positive
fans of the show will know what to expect and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film,positive
director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television,positive
there are some truly suspenseful and wellcreated scenes here late in the film when theyre in the alien spacecraft youll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema,positive
the special effects are very good and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic,positive
what i find interesting is that the xfiles is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story,positive
our heroes are given subtle introductions were not expected to know them on the outset and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isnt required to understand the film,positive
there are of course little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans but ill keep those as surprises,positive
it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly,positive
the series is strong for a lot of reasons,positive
its original though it has many ties to the twilight zone and owes some homage to hitchcock and impressively eerie for a television show,positive
what really makes the series shine however are the actors,positive
duchovny has so much presence and is just a fun guy to watch,positive
he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man,positive
anderson is equally good and paralyzingly beautiful shes also a strong actress,positive
both performers have acted in little more than their series however though i think theyll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon,positive
i enthusiastically recommend the xfiles both for fans and nonfans,positive
1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry,positive
its an intelligent film and takes you places that you might not have been or at least might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar,positive
the xfiles is impressive in concept as well fans of the series are likely to be highly critical and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move,positive
its nice to see a risk pay off for a change,positive
actually its nice to see a risk at all,positive
james jones one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual,positive
a veteran of world war ii and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature,positive
they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence a trait which lends itself to razorsharp focus,positive
but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel the thin red line now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick,positive
the books principal cast some thirty characters has been trimmed down for this rendition but it still retains its most endearing value,positive
each of the roles has an everyman quality emphasizing jones examination of world war ii on the american soldier,positive
theres a definitive chain of command present and this also plays on the motivations of the cast,positive
but most importantly and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie a dynamic and effective voiceover is used,positive
malick has several characters relating their thoughts giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake,positive
the issues at stake are many and one,positive
told from a limited thirdperson perspective as opposed to a topdown omniscient view the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company cforcharlie to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal,positive
the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war,positive
and want to win the war they do,positive
in an excellent performance nick nolte plays cforcharlies commanding officer lt col gordon tall,positive
hes an aging soldier who embodies the winatallcosts mentality if only to impress his superior john travolta in a questionable cameo,positive
this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros elias koteas who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command,positive
at the front are the privates and corporals adrien brody james caviezel ben chaplin et al lead by 1st sgt,positive
welsh sean penn who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them,positive
the thin red line is filled with intense visual poetry but its nearly three hours long,positive
although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours the climax comes fortyfive minutes before the end of the movie it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end,positive
the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998s other masterpiece of war saving private ryan a countless number of times,positive
but to do so is to belittle both films for although similarities abound so do differences,positive
director malick has a story to tell and for those interested in listening this can be a very outstanding movie,positive
once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek mike myers was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice seven dwarves and all the other fairy tale characters in the land banished from their home by lord farquaad john lithgow,positive
unwittingly befriended by a nonstop talking donkey eddie murphy shrek travels to dulloc to speak with farquaad where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner,positive
his prize,positive
to save princess fiona cameron diaz from a tower surrounded by molten flame and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaads bride,positive
the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in shrek,positive
it took four writers ted elliott and terry rossio the road to el dorado roger s h,positive
schulman balto and joe stillman beavis and butthead do america to adapt william steigs childrens book,positive
the bad news,positive
theyve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldmans the princess bride,positive
the good news,positive
theres so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches,positive
we get our first inkling that were in for a real treat as one of farquaads men intent on rounding up magical creatures offers five schillings for the possessed boy after observing dreamworks rendition of disneys animated pinocchio,positive
meanwhile within the castle walls a gingerbread man being tortured,positive
by farquaad spits icing and yells eat me,positive
before breaking down and solemnly asking do you know the muffin man,positive
shrek a green giant with bobbly antennaelike ears is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax,positive
donkey is a hyperactive endearingly stunted creature who can talk and therefore believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek,positive
donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princessguarding dragon,positive
the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning shes not getting the fairy tale issue rescue shes been expecting,positive
when fionas true colors are exposed including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor a spark develops between her and shrek,positive
the scripts details are gleefully impish constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaads dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and its a small world parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most undisneyish fate after duetting with fiona snow white style,positive
popular culture is represented with film references to babe and charlies angels via the matrix,positive
myers chooses his so i married an axe murderer scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft,positive
while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film overall it works more than not,positive
eddie murphy steals the show as the fasttalking motownsinging donkey proving once again his talent as a vocal performer is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon a creature murphy portrayed in disneys mulan,positive
lithgows a good choice for the supercilious heightchallenged villain lord farquaad,positive
diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona,positive
a better choice would have been minnie driver whos proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disneys tarzan princess mononoke and the south park movie,positive
the computer animation looks terrific particularly donkey although it wont elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixars work toy story a bugs life toy story 2,positive
in keeping with its hip style pop music is used which like myers voice may be initially jarring but ultimately satisfies while surveying bridal candidates via a dating game parody broadcast by snow whites evil queens mirror farquaad is told fiona likes pina coladas cue jimmy buffet,positive
shrek has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group in the family,positive
while it may be derivative of the 1987s the princess bride shrek addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesnt suffer in the comparison,positive
known as the most successful highestgrossing romantic comedy in history director garry marshall apparently struck gold with pretty woman which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but thanks to positive wordofmouth was able to reach upwards of 175million in theaters alone,positive
the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the films two charismatic stars richard gere and julia roberts since the story itself is none too original or even believable,positive
the other winning element that makes pretty woman so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence which is rarely as palpable in todays films as it is here,positive
edward lewis richard gere is a suave extremely wealthy business mogul who at the start of the picture breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument and abruptly takes his friends car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel,positive
stopping the car along the street he asks a woman obviously a prostitute for directions,positive
agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks edward ultimately accepts they strike up a conversation and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor,positive
this meeting does not lead to sex however as edward confides that hed rather just have someone to talk to and offers her 300 to spend the night,positive
just as well since the hooker named vivian is a beautiful generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear,positive
the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned when edward finally offers to pay vivian threethousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and gettogethers,positive
since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act edward and vivian will finally truly kiss,positive
allegedly planned as a grim downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director pretty woman has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale a la cinderella,positive
the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been,positive
you honestly dont need a highiq or any iq for that matter to guess how the film will end and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha,positive
the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and lessthangratifying and the screenplay is no award winner,positive
and yet amidst all of these qualms and flaws pretty woman is an astoundingly charming motion picture and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers,positive
youd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go and there are a few select moments not even whole scenes mind you that are as romantic as anything ive seen on film in the 1990s,positive
additionally the film belongs and its success can be attributed to two people and two people only and they are richard gere and julia roberts,positive
playing sex symbols throughout the 80s with such pictures as american gigolo and an officer and a gentleman gere branches out here to play a more quiet almost shy but still alluring character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet and vice versa,positive
julia roberts in her breakthrough role after 1988s wellreceived mistic pizza and 1989s steel magnolia for which she was nominated for an academy award is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers not for her line of work but more for her sheer intelligence,positive
it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake but screenwriter j f lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing,positive
after pretty woman roberts along with meg ryan became the reigning queen of romantic comedies with her latest being the justreleased runaway bride which repairs gere and roberts together once again and no wonder,positive
roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy but also one who can efficiently do drama and in almost every film she appears in it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male costar,positive
an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his coworkers that vivian is actually a prostitute and he then approaches her making sexual advances,positive
no only does this make vivian feel cheap especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional eloquent young lady but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading and if she likes this particular path,positive
on the more dreamy side the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold especially one in which edward enters into the hotels lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress but also her inner and outer glowing beauty,positive
another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward who is asleep and placing it on his lips since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days,positive
pretty woman does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene which is a happy ending as youd expect and wouldnt have it any other way that somehow does not work perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances,positive
this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film though because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem,positive
helped along by a warm memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo as vivians best friend and roommate and a fabulously catchy soundtrack in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movies overall fulfillment pretty woman is a sparkler of a motion picture and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy,positive
disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure mulan,positive
while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults,positive
fa mulan mingna wen singing lea salonga wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family its,positive
just that she doesnt quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time,positive
while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker miriam margoyles mulan would prefer speaking her mind,positive
but there is trouble on the horizon,positive
the evil huns led by shanyu miguel ferrer are invading china,positive
the emperor pat morita has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army,positive
the only male in mulans family is her father fa zhou soontek oh who old and with a bad leg honorably accepts his fate,positive
mulan on the other hand decides to save her fathers life by,positive
secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield,positive
mulan under the assumed name of ping appears at camp where she along with the other bumbling recruits yao harvey fierstein chienpo jerry tondo and ling gedde watanabe are trained in the art of war by captain shang b d,positive
wong singing donny osmond,positive
but shes not alone in her tasks in,positive
typical disney fashion she has three animal companions her horse khan a lucky cricket crickey and a pintsized guardian dragon called mushu eddie murphy,positive
much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesnt flow well with the rest of the more serious story,positive
sure some occasional comic relief is welcome particularly in a film geared for the younger set but mulan overdoes it,positive
the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good but schizophrenic experience,positive
but that commentary aside this is a very well made film which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable,positive
the animation is on par with some of disneys best,positive
the story itself is interesting and the action scenes are aweinspiring,positive
the musical score to the film is enjoyable though as has been the case with disneys recent work the songs are mostly forgettable,positive
at least were only subjected to four of them this time around,positive
mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date,positive
most of the killing is offscreen and its all highly depersonalized theres nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambis mom,positive
theres nothing graphic and the film resides snugly inside a g rating,positive
children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies,positive
its ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition,positive
if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor ax the compulsory songs and remove the obligatory and somewhat unrealistic romance they could have had a classic on their hands,positive
instead they merely deliver a very good time at the movies,positive
tone alone cannot sustain a film but it can go a long way,positive
if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story it scores immediate style points,positive
when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly literary,positive
whats eating gilbert grape,positive
is such a film,positive
its a rich memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence,positive
gilbert grape johnny depp is a young man living in rural endora iowa facing incredible responsibilities,positive
as the man of the house since his fathers suicide gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store,positive
he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie leonardo dicaprio and help care for his extremely overweight mother darlene cates,positive
gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky juliette lewis a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down,positive
as he spends time with becky gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing,positive
slowly his resentment builds until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people,positive
director lasse hallstrom my life as a dog and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges screenplay based on his own novel,positive
endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else,positive
the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real,positive
minor characters like crispin glover as the towns mortician are vividly realized and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgens desperately unhappy housewife,positive
one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise attended by the entire town and accompanied by the offkey high school band,positive
not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false,positive
the same can be said of the character of gilbert,positive
its testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line when becky responds to gilberts description of his father with i knew someone like that once,positive
gilbert is a man harboring an evergrowing bitterness about where he finds himself in life a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty,positive
in one scene he allows local children to look at his mother through their window displaying her like a side show attraction,positive
his entire life seems to be mocked by arnies repeated chants of were not going anywhere but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer and it becomes clear that he is following in his fathers footsteps in this regard,positive
johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface but he never gives in to onedimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny joon and edward scissorhands,positive
depps performance is overshadowed however by leonardo dicaprios astonishing oscarnominated supporting work as arnie,positive
he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real,positive
dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hardpressed to spot a flaw,positive
darlene cates a firsttime actor brings real pain to her scenes as gilberts tortured mother and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilberts sisters,positive
only juliette lewis doesnt quite click playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark,positive
gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion but it never lost me,positive
thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast this 1993 release proves well worth the wait,positive
the bond series is an island in the film world where else would we look forward to cliches and all of the other things that occur in most of these films,positive
where else would pure escapism a vulnerable hero the talking villains blatant product placement predictable action sequences and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change,positive
i dont understand it myself but thats what the bond series is based on,positive
for i think 18 films weve mostly got the same thing over and over again with some variation and a bit of change most notably in the two dalton films,positive
but even i a king of cynicism cant bitch about it,positive
and tomorrow never dies the again i think eighteenth bond film and second brosnan bond film is no exception,positive
thank god,positive
the plot as in most of them is pure balderdash but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it,positive
instead of just plain billionaire psychotics we get a rupert murdochesque media elliot carver jonathan pryce looking bitching with a whitehaired cru cut and always talking like hes out of breath who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war,positive
no this is not wag the dog he wants a real war between china and england and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it in,positive
comes bond,positive
james is sent all around the world trying to do research on carver fighting with his men and running into on more than one occasion a chinese secret agent like him wai lin michelle yeoh asian action star extraordinaire and,positive
costar of supercop nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one,positive
the two eventually and predictably of course begin working together and yes there is some sexual tension between the two,positive
luckily their relationship is never strained and she never gives into his cassanovaness until the finale,positive
thank god again,positive
in every bond film james bags on average three women sometimes more sometimes less the latter being more potent towards the aidscautionary dalton and he doesnt spoil this one though we never see them of course i mean they need to stay around a pg13 rating,positive
theres always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again the big bond girl yeoh and this time we have an almostcameo by teri hatcher as carvers wife paris who it seems was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning,positive
yes teris very attractive but she seems kind of dull,positive
of course its not really her fault her part is underwritten and shes only in a small part of it,positive
oh well,positive
and there are always the big henchmen the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains,positive
this time we get a tall arianlooking not to mention robert shaw in from russia with love looking guy named stamper goetz otto who is pretty awesome although a bit stiff well mostly his posture really,positive
and for a bit of comedy we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point,positive
the government people have small parts as usual with q desmond llewelyn looking near death sadly getting only one scene in a more grouchy mood than usual and m judi dench getting more than m usually gets i mean it is judi dench,positive
and for no reason whatsoever except cause he was so good in goldeneye joe don baker shows up again as wade admitting he has no reason for being there and is this time more annoying,positive
again oh well,positive
the action sequences are not a letdown although sometimes go on too long,positive
they pop up every now and then mainly because they have to for the sake of the series and some significant ones are the opening one one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control and a motorcylce chase on a bmw cycle nonetheless through china streets or was it vietnam the,positive
plots not really essential,positive
theyre more hightech and feature much more laughs which yeah i dig,positive
so what if theyre distracting theyre supposed to be,positive
the acting from most around is great,positive
yeoh is actually one of the better bond girls mainly because shes so unique,positive
the better bond girls are more independent and have a certain wilyness to them,positive
pussy galore with her homoerotic undertones and all is one of the best and diana rigg who married bond at the end of on her majestys secret service only to be killed added some emotional depth,positive
yeoh is notable since shes so active and has great chemistry with brosnan,positive
pryce is an awesome villain being slimy and lovable at the same time,positive
and brosnan is once again the mack daddy,positive
the bond series is built on cliches mainly because theyre so fun and add to the escapism,positive
if you can remember the dalton years and theyre serious direction you remember how unsuccessful they were both financially and aesthetically,positive
the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot too many themes and too much characterization,positive
i dont really understand it myself yet im one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states,positive
having seen all of them more than once yes ive seen this twice already you can tell i adore them,positive
while its not one of the best like goldfinger or from russia with love tomorrow never dies is nonetheless a truly awesome installment even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones,positive
scarface a remake of the 1932 film of the same name is a very gripping and as far as i know a truetolife story of how power and violence lead to corruption,positive
al pacino as tony montana for whom the movie is named also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami,positive
oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles,positive
the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states,positive
many of these cubans had criminal records such as tony montana a cocky fasttalking man who has the look of crime,positive
nearly right after his arrival in miami tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry,positive
along with his friend and partner manolo steven bauer tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez robert loggia a highroller in the organized crime field,positive
tony also begins to fall in love with elvira michelle pfeiffer who at the time was franks lover,positive
of course sooner or later in this industry betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force,positive
this is not before he becomes one of the most respected and often feared men in miami,positive
tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him,positive
no one can trust him and basically no one does,positive
scarface although incredibly violent is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino,positive
although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance it truly is a very good one,positive
in fact his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination although he did get a golden globe nomination,positive
another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity,positive
a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word fuck and its uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film which is apparently a record,positive
the thing is the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie,positive
as odd as it sounds its true,positive
in the end scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard,positive
at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8year olds,positive
thats true of home alone 2 and id bet money that its true of home alone 3 opening soon,positive
but home alone actually has a lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesnt get in the way,positive
the mcalisters all 15 of them are going to france for the holidays,positive
four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse,positive
the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kids cruelty,positive
kevins patience runs out when he learns that his plaincheese pizza has already been eaten and hes going to have to starve,positive
he attacks his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him,positive
the fight disrupts the alreadychaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table a few cousins and an uncle,positive
the kneejerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin,positive
nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased but they all point their fingers when he fights back,positive
the ultimate punishment comes from mom catherine ohara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night,positive
on his way up the stairs he tells her that families suck and that he hopes never to see any of his family again,positive
that night the power goes out knocking out the alarm clocks so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport,positive
in a surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family heads off without him,positive
its interesting that in a subtle way his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children,positive
first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class,positive
theyre twothirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child,positive
meanwhile kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true,positive
hes finally rid of his family,positive
life is a dream come true,positive
he can jump on the beds watch rrated movies eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips and dig through his big brothers secret box,positive
slowly the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane,positive
he grooms himself he does the laundry he goes shopping i bought some milk eggs and fabric softener,positive
he also starts to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring,positive
the furnace in the basement is a scary monster the old man next door is a snowshovel murderer and two crooks are trying to break into his house,positive
macaulay culkin is cute but he isnt much of an actor,positive
still we can see that kevins character grows thanks to some good direction and editing,positive
for example acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night just as santa is getting in his car,positive
kevin asks the man to pass on his request he wants his family back to the real santa,positive
he learned how to deal with the furnace,positive
you turn on the lights and its not so scary anymore,positive
he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snowshovel murderer who actually turns out to be a nice man,positive
they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid,positive
finally in the last 20 minutes kevin confronts his last fear the bandits head on literally,positive
this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movies genuine dramatic setup it is dessert,positive
its a lot of fun and it doesnt overwhelm the rest of the movie,positive
on the whole home alone is a great holiday movie,positive
john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings,positive
but it does have its flaws,positive
the smallest problem is that culkin doesnt act very well,positive
as i said before he is cute but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkins insight into his character,positive
the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villains threaten kevins life about five times,positive
instead of im gonna get that kid they say im gonna kill that kid,positive
some might argue that the tone is the same but i strongly disagree,positive
mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic fauxpas,positive
ill probably never see home alone 3 and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 but i do enjoy home alone almost every year,positive
dont let your impressions of the others detract from the original which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick,positive
its no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office,positive
a poorlywritten script can be bested by a superb acting corps and a wellwritten piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs,positive
in directing his latest actioncomedy director brett ratner money talks takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all getout buddy cop movie,positive
in addition rush hour serves as a firstclass example of directing a movie with conservative attitude a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types,positive
the two lead names share equal screen time here mostly because they spend it together,positive
jackie chan in his first completely american production makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts,positive
the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago knock off stands no chance against the content of this one,positive
chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise and theres no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldnt believe their eyes the first time,positive
chris tucker on the opposite side relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chans performance,positive
he works perfectly with the script and its quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines,positive
almost essential to the action genre the plot is nonexistent,positive
were quickly introduced to detective james carter tucker is a maverick officer for the lapd,positive
cut forward to another scene where the daughter julia hsu of the american chinese consul tzi ma is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters,positive
the fbi is quick to the rescue but the consul insists that one of his men detective inspector lee chan be brought on the case to help,positive
the fbi resists but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective,positive
its here that carter and lee hook up and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up,positive
rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up but it doesnt quite reach the top tier of actioncomedies like last years grosse pointe blank,positive
there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan this might be a major drawback,positive
also some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride and others are there simply to look menacing,positive
however none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background,positive
almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another whether its tuckers toneddown routine or chans tight rein on his action sequences and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types,positive
a recommendable visit to the theater indeed,positive
synopsis captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 the baku from the evil admiral dougherty and ruafro,positive
the enterprise crew in the meantime experience the rejuvenating qualities of the baku homeworld lt worf grows a pimple data sings opera pieces picard scores with a baku chick riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts,positive
comments star trek the next generation was a hugely successful sequel tv series to star trek a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s,positive
even though it still enjoyed high ratings star trek the next generation ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original star trek s cast in paramounts film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise,positive
star trek insurrection is the ninth star trek movie and the third to focus on the star trek the next generation crew,positive
star trek insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans such as myself would rate somewhere between okay and good,positive
after star trek v the final frontier a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise,positive
i dont wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies,positive
most people reading this probably havent followed star trek anyway so a comparison would seem tedious at best,positive
let me thus make my comparisons briefly so that its out of my system star trek insurrection is not as good as the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrections comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv the voyage home star trek ii the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie,positive
okay lets move to the movie itself,positive
star trek insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise humanitys exploration and colonization of space with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners,positive
this combination works well more often than it fails but when it does fail the humor really seems cheesy,positive
much of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprises crew,positive
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times,positive
star trek insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the baku homeworld,positive
forget the actors and special effects the beautiful setting of this movie with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys steals the show,positive
this tranquility however is broken by data an android who reveals to the baku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies the sona,positive
it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young healthy state,positive
the enterprise crew led by captain picard investigates datas actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the sona and an enterprise admiral to relocate the baku and plunder the planets youthrestoring properties,positive
sound pretty heavy,positive
it is though this plot anything but unique and groundbreaking is undermined by the films constant barrage of humor,positive
when going after data for instance picard sings an opera piece with him this is supposed to be cute and humorous,positive
in a much more funny sequence work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the baku homeworld a pimple which his crewmates try as they might cannot avoid looking at,positive
the acting in star trek insurrection is for the most part pretty good,positive
since theyve been playing these characters for years those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough,positive
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers a moral speech picards trademark with his usual aplomb,positive
brent spiner another fine actor plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film though the old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series,positive
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good,positive
despite many other critics negative opinions f murray abraham the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus plays the major villain ruafro well enough,positive
ruafro reminds me somewhat of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune,positive
like the baron ruafro continuously has his skin looked after it is stretched and stapled by servants,positive
in one particularly memorable scene ruafro becomes very agitated and his facial skin splits open and bleeds,positive
ruafro is no khan from star trek iithe best trek villain everbut he is much better than the forgettable dr soran from star trek generations,positive
okay i promise no more comparisons,positive
donna murphy must also be noted as a baku woman anij who picard falls in love with,positive
murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance,positive
this is the type of woman whom picard for those who know the character well would be enchanted with,positive
in fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here,positive
a particular plot point involving anijs ability to slow time down an ability which she shares with picard becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie,positive
for as good as the actors and setting were star trek insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing,positive
they proved adequate sometimes barely for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars the phantom menace a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection,positive
the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships in particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and ruafro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite,positive
the new enterprise itself only seen in this film and its predecessor remains largely unexplored though its exterior doesnt look quite right for a reason i cannot explain,positive
despite star trek insurrections frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects i enjoyed the film,positive
it maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors particularly star trek first contact though dont get me wrong the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully,positive
id recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general,positive
rated pg i cant see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience young or old,positive
synopsis an attractive mute makeup artist working on an ultracheesy slasher movie in moscow witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians,positive
meanwhile the artists sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her,positive
comments mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it,positive
drawn by the clever artwork on the video box i rented the film expecting a complete turkey,positive
mute witness however was original offbeat and wellmade,positive
its one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about,positive
ive subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit and it may be seen on occasion on the independent film channel,positive
the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense as billy the quite believable mute heroine sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film,positive
the rest of the film takes good advantage of billys vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures,positive
to throw a curveball into the fray billys sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes,positive
a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film,positive
look for alec guinness obiwan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy in a small role as the evil reaper,positive
definately check this movie out although as a word of warning it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly arent for the squeamish,positive
in may of 1977 just 2 years after steven spielbergs success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas the godfather a risky ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success,positive
little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film,positive
in january of this year lucas rereleased star wars on its 20th anniversary,positive
in this new remastered version the added effects which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computergenerated jabba the hutt dont do much but call attention to themselves,positive
other than these the film is exactly the same,positive
why pay to see it in the theaters you might ask,positive
simply because when this movie was released most of us were a few years short of being born,positive
we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience especially if you havent seen it,positive
the plot is basic but in the same way complex,positive
it has many themes but the one rotates around luke skywalker mark hamill and his quest to become a jedi knight,positive
his mission begins when a droid named r2d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia carrie fisher which tells him to contact the mysterious obiwan kanoby alec guiness,positive
he and kanoby then joined by two intergalactic renegades hans solo harrison ford and chewbacca and skywalkers two droids d2 and c3po the voice of anthony edwards wage war upon the corrupt empire commanded by an evil general peter cushing and the traitorous darth vader the voice of james earl jones,positive
skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger the force,positive
the film is obviously quite starstudded,positive
but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones voice would appear so many more times in the future,positive
it just happened to work out for him,positive
the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalkers triumph is symbolized by the audiences sense of becoming something larger than life itselfa universe of fans young and old recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever,positive
synopsis bobby garfield yelchin lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother hope davis,positive
bobbys world revolves around his friends especially the spritely carol boorem,positive
then one day a new boarder arrives at bobbys house,positive
ted brautigan hopkins is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking,positive
as the bond between bobby and ted deepens bobby becomes privy to teds great secret an event which will change both of their lives forever,positive
review a small but enchanting movie hearts in atlantis easily recalls another kinginspired comingofage film stand by me both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys,positive
hearts is a tribute to the magic of childhood to those summers when the days seem neverending and nothing means more than your closest friends,positive
unlike stand by me there is a supernatural element to hearts but although it is key to the plot it is not prominent,positive
like stand by me this is a mostly characterdriven film and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting,positive
yelchin is very good as bobby finding a good mix of innocence and resignation,positive
more splendid still is boorem whom i praised highly for her work in along came a spider and who is simply radiant here as carol,positive
and then there is hopkins who despite playing such a quiet introspective character as ted nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen,positive
less successful is davis whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish,positive
i also found it odd that bobby and carols other friend sully whose death as an adult sets up the movies flashback framing device is paid virtually no attention,positive
but hicks direction is lovely without being cloying and despite the movies general lack of incident it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience,positive
by now i figured id seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a halfdozen times not that im complaining,positive
to call him the master of suspense is an understatement,positive
the paradine case 1947 admittedly one of hitchcocks lesser movies turned out to be one id missed,positive
this one like all hitchcock films is well worth savoring,positive
the story opens with the rich mrs maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband,positive
as mrs paradine alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world,positive
to franz waxmans stark and moody music we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels,positive
stripped of her fine raiment she becomes a commoner again which as it turns out was what she was before she met her husband,positive
a brief skirmish and youll be lunching at the savoy again anthony keane her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting predicting a fast and easy trial,positive
gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister,positive
shes no murderess he argues simplistically smitten by her beauty,positive
shes too fine a woman,positive
his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife gay ann todd,positive
unlike most hitchcock movies which are centered on the thriller and the mystery this one is more a romantic melodrama,positive
typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light,positive
she deflects her husbands affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client,positive
the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs paradines portrait nearby,positive
in the relatively unsatisfying first half little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires,positive
to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs paradine acquitted because if mrs paradine dies his heart will go with her,positive
if she is freed he will be able to forget her,positive
as part of the soap opera a mysterious louis jordan plays mr paradines valet who has had some not to be discussed relationships,positive
charles coburn plays anthonys legal partner sir simon flaquer,positive
and charles laughton who looks like coburn is judge lord horfield,positive
this being proper british society they will all dine together at the judges house not long before the case begins,positive
court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences some subtle and others not between the american and the british judicial systems,positive
one for example of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying,positive
one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations,positive
as the judges wife lady sophie horfield ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress the films only nomination for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit,positive
so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walkon,positive
at 37 minutes into the film he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case,positive
dont miss it,positive
in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom,positive
the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first,positive
watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trials action,positive
as anthony explains it the simple case has only 3 possibilities mr paradine poisoned himself mrs paradine did it or the valet did it,positive
the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid,positive
the paradine case runs 1 53,positive
the picture is in black and white,positive
it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested,positive
one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction,positive
the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy innocent fun,positive
sometimes the stories are compelling,positive
sometimes theyre not,positive
but with the exception of the first film in the series which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ive never been bored by any of the enterprises numerous missions,positive
star trek insurrection is no exception,positive
the film has gotten some negative reviews a friend of mine actually thinks its the worst in the series but im not really sure why,positive
its an exciting often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film,positive
some say its a bit too light and more of a long episode than a film,positive
others say the special effects are cheesy and that its boring,positive
i simply enjoyed the film,positive
insurrection which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast introduces us to a race of people called the baku the baku are very old most of them are about three hundred years old but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet,positive
of course these peaceful people cant horde this fountain of youth all for themselves leave it up to their archenemies the sona led by ruafo f,positive
murray abraham to mess everything up,positive
the sona who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable strike a deal with the federation to move the baku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying,positive
thats when captain picard patrick stewart steps in he realizes that moving the baku would kill them it also helps that he falls in love with a baku woman donna murphy,positive
so with his trusty crew picard defies the federation to keep the baku in their natural habitat,positive
when dealing with a series with as much history as this its not entirely necessary to reintroduce your characters with each episode,positive
this is why i believe nonfans have a hard time getting into star trek in order to enjoy it one has to understand how to approach it,positive
insurrection however does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters,positive
stewart is bold as always a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together,positive
jonathan frakes who also directed is funny as commander riker a subplot with data brent spiner discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy,positive
frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact insurrection is an exciting film with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action,positive
this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation and the result is very pleasing to the eye particularly in the climactic scenes in which the sona employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the baku planet the special effects have a clean impressively sharp look,positive
if i have any complaint about the film its that it tries to take a moral stance when its not very appropriate to do so,positive
i dont think its that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 baku in order to save the lives of thousands,positive
better yet why couldnt they have coexisted,positive
insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience,positive
with its inherent camp factor the star trek series doesnt seem wellequipped to deal with issues like this,positive
i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle,positive
good will hunting is two movies in one an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood prodigy child film complete with upbeats downfalls sporadically moving situations and plenty plenty of shtick,positive
unusually directed by gus van sant good will hunting overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh new talent,positive
the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor stellan skarsgard who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams,positive
in a nutshell thats it,positive
the core of the good will hunting is damon who infuses the script co written by chasing amys ben affleck with just the right amount of warmth sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi talented performer,positive
but its the acting that hits the mark and damon hits all the right notes flying over robin williams dejavu role awakenings was written all over this as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wifes tragic death,positive
damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein,positive
his rich complex character is the pulp of good will hunting,positive
everything else pales in comparison,positive
good will hunting exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling but unlike little man tate or phenomenon it doesnt set up its story in a black and white point a to point b be manner but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesnt automatically signify he must make easy familiar choices like the protagonists in the aforementioned,positive
jonathan demmes beloved based on the book toni morrison is a study in skillful literary adaptation,positive
on the one hand the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel evoking morrisons pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice,positive
on the other hand beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the storys main events,positive
this choice is a smartly made one for it creates an open space in which the storys wide range of emotions can gestate and grow,positive
indeed the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled,positive
beloved takes place in the second half of the 19th century during the socalled reconstruction era after the civil war,positive
for newlyfreed slaves it is a time of confusion and turmoil,positive
oprah winfrey is sethe a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse where she hoped the terror would end,positive
what she did not know was that it would follow her there and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished,positive
beloved ultimately tells the story of sethes search for forgiveness one longhampered by an unforgettable sin,positive
the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethes escape as a violent unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse,positive
invisible hands terrorize her family flinging objects across rooms shaking tables rattling floorboards,positive
sethes sons run away perhaps for good leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves,positive
demmes matteroffact handling of this supernatural element is just one of beloveds intriguing aspects,positive
all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real,positive
when paul d danny glover a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghosts hellish visions he doesnt run in terror,positive
instead he asks who the ghost is,positive
as in morrisons novel demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created,positive
sethe is the one being haunted but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears,positive
in fact the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay,positive
the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved thandie newton a young blackclad woman who appears on sethes front lawn leaned christlike against a tree stump,positive
sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health,positive
they know not who she is but that doesnt matter,positive
only paul d is suspicious of the stranger,positive
little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years,positive
winfrey is arguably beloveds greatest asset,positive
she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show,positive
lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later,positive
danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d as is kimberly elise as denver sethes wanderlusting daughter,positive
as sethes sagelike motherinlaw old baby suggs beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears,positive
the films least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself,positive
thandie newton plays the glassyeyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first but which becomes offputting and unintentionally laughable by the end,positive
departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as the silence of the lambs and melvin howard director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrisons novel,positive
totemic camera shots and colorsaturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demmes films but the few he uses here work to the films benefit,positive
beloveds most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs gatherings in a forest clearing where the bright yellowgreens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs words do,positive
for the most part though demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality,positive
this combined with morrisons equally frugal method of storytelling may make beloved somewhat of a challenge to watch even to those familiar with the book,positive
though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film,positive
nothing is spoonfed to the viewer,positive
morrisons novel is just as enigmatic but unlike a movie a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb,positive
the movie begins like poltergeist and ends like the color purple with shades of the scarlet letter and little women somewhere in the middle,positive
taken as a whole beloved is a disquieting oneofakind experience one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance,positive
ingredients london gal fate true love running joke about monty pythons spanish inquisition,positive
synopsis american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair playing a londoner,positive
believe it,positive
sliding doors is a love what if story,positive
the gimmick is that its really two stories the film follows the life of helen gwyneth paltrow down two directions,positive
in the beginning likeable gal helen gwyneth paltrow gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job,positive
so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping livein lover gerry john lynch,positive
helen doesnt know it but she is at a fateful junction in life 1 if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future,positive
the film shows what happens in both paths switching back and forth between intertwined parallel stories,positive
in story one helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james john hannah on the train,positive
arriving home early she discovers that her livein gerry john lynch is having sex with his former lover lydia jeanne tripplehorn,positive
this leads to a life where helen moves out,positive
helens winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart and encourages her to start her own business,positive
in story two helen experiences a different fate,positive
she misses the train never meets james and doesnt get home early enough to discover gerrys infidelity,positive
in this new life helen takes up odd menial jobs and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry,positive
will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios,positive
opinion rejoice all ye monty python fans gwyneth paltrow fans and watchers of quirky romance flicks,positive
at last heres proof that theres still creativity in 1990s filmmaking,positive
sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year,positive
not only is it a wellacted heartwarming film but its also easily gwyneth paltrows best recent performance,positive
when helen paltrow screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a shagging wanker a british phrase better left untranslated she sounds like she knows what shes talking about,positive
nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes,positive
nobody scrambles around in danger screaming i will find you no matter what my darling,positive
when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james she doesnt take the easy way out and leap into his arms since shes supposed to be recovering from heartache,positive
and handsome livein boyfriend gerry isnt the stereotypical screen hunk either a stud or a snob,positive
instead hes a nervous and indecisive almost helpless hunk,positive
another example when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital sliding doors gives us neither the hospital miracle nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation,positive
in other words all of the characters seem nonstereotyped human and local,positive
there are minor inconveniences,positive
since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates its occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two,positive
distinguishing between the two stories isnt a problem in the scenes containing paltrow who sports two different hairstyles,positive
but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry who look the same in both stories its slightly confusing,positive
also quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture seinfeld woody allen etc are spoken by the british characters,positive
but these seem slightly forced given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang,positive
possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable,positive
sliding doors is a charming quirky original happy romance with a little philosophy of fate thrown in,positive
monty python and the meaning of fate anybody,positive
the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate,positive
people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future,positive
after a sort of confusing bit involving fakelooking cyborg things the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds,positive
the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while make that every 1000 years or so an evil force comes to destroy earth,positive
the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element,positive
the plot in this movie really isnt that important to the thing though,positive
this movie has very good special effects for the most part,positive
the technoish music in the background fits the mood very well,positive
bruce willis is an illegal taxicab driver in a futuristic new york city,positive
one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk,positive
this movie is about what happens,positive
the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations,positive
also there is a fair bit of action in the film particularly towards the end,positive
some characters are just plain strange including a highlyenergetic deejay in drag,positive
bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does,positive
the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down,positive
it is one of those scifi films where youll be saying cool followed by a what the hell,positive
i give the fifth element,positive
in arguably the most anticipated movie this century george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster,positive
despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence in the sound and special effects department,positive
in terms of characters by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala natalie portman whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age,positive
she is one hot babe who defines true woman leadership,positive
she not only has a presence but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination,positive
no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything,positive
the young obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who has a bad hair day in every scene gets to kill a bad guy in the end but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero,positive
in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners,positive
i mean it would be interesting to see yodas girlfriend for a change if he has one,positive
not much better is quigon jinn liam neeson who mostly broods and has a better hair do than obiwan but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life,positive
also fascinating is george lucas metoclorian theory which claims that microorganisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe,positive
and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force,positive
more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force,positive
overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that its predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor,positive
by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan,positive
watch out for the next one it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker who i believe should be portrayed by leonardo di caprio,positive
back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie antz,positive
the film was critically acclaimed and went on to gross almost 100m dollars at the domestic box office,positive
again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film the prince of egypt and it named an instant classic and became a huge hit as well,positive
on a winning streak they released the road to el dorado and it wasnt as big as they hoped but still did ok then they had the fantastic chicken run in the summer,positive
now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name one of the top five best animated films,positive
shrek mike myers is about a loving green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself,positive
surrounded by fairy tale characters he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone,positive
the ruler of duloc is the short heartless lord farquaad john lithgow who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures if they are captured and arrested,positive
of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver but one of those creatures is donkey eddie murphy,positive
a regular donkey except he talks and has a definite attitude after his owner tries to disown him he escapes into the woods and runs into shrek,positive
lord farquaad however has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shreks house,positive
to get his property back and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona cameron diaz so lord farquaad can be a king,positive
shrek wants his property back but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona,positive
shrek is such an amazing film that while watching it you cant help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company cant make movies like this,positive
the animated graphics are so great that they look every bit of realistic,positive
i saw previews for this film all last year and i thought to myself wow what a great movie this will be,positive
i must say i was not disappointed at all and the film is the best of 2001 so far and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year,positive
the voice talents are brilliant as well with the comic genius mike myers,positive
in the past he has been a wayne an austin and a person married to an ax murderer,positive
now he is shrek not only does he do the voice talent but he is shrek,positive
with his irish accent and he lovable personality shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart,positive
eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s mulan does another bang up job here and he is the comic relief in the film,positive
the tones of his voice the lines he utters and the jokes he gives he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in aladdin,positive
the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well,positive
she is very funny and her character fits her to a t of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow who is personally one of my favorite actors,positive
he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time,positive
at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics that you cant help but just start looking at backgrounds,positive
there is many hidden jokes in the film and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera,positive
shrek is a definite kid film but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy,positive
there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids wont get but the parents will be laughing,positive
believe me though everyone will be laughing the entire way through,positive
in the end shrek gives a very important message to its audience to enjoy and be who you are,positive
everybody out there is beautiful in their own way even though it may be inside,positive
theres not many words that can praise shrek enough but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now,positive
one year has passed since the last time we saw them and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but theyve moved out of their parents homes and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse,positive
waynes still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend cassandra and of course garth is still having his own personal growing pains,positive
they guys are just finishing off one of their shows and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film,positive
again the promoter is not only after the money that cassandras talent can bring in,positive
the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original guy loses chick guy realizes mistake and guy gets chick back,positive
fortunately there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot,positive
the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color,positive
highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park garths seduction by a married woman a surprise appearance by charleton heston a 1960s batman setup in the guys pad and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some naked indian guy an unexpected lipsync of ymca you could see that one coming a mile away and of course a hilarious parody of those badlydubbed kungfu movies we love to laugh at,positive
and if youve ever wondered why theres always boxes of watermelons chickens and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets youll find out here,positive
this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more,positive
garth has somewhat of a coming of age and wayne gets to learn a little about himself with a little help from our old friend jim morrison,positive
a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh and luckily few if any of them are overused,positive
overall the movie has plenty of continuity flaws especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandras dad but these are easily overlooked as this is after waynes world,positive
the plot is flimsy but manageable,positive
there are a few special effects but they are fairly seamless and fill nicely into the plot,positive
the acting is good for this sort of movie but there are some very bright spots,positive
in the big picture this movie is just plain fun,positive
there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special,positive
during the whole one hour and 40 minutes i didnt even think about looking at my watch a single time,positive
silly but riotous at times this is an excellent movie even better than the original,positive
after hearing reviews for woody allens upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just soso my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time,positive
woody allens films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit handinhand manhattan really is one of the bestlooking films ive ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the citys best areas etc a fan cant help but feel visibly moved,positive
the film opens up with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane,positive
beethovens 5th blasts on the soundtrack,positive
the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and its all rather lovely to look at,positive
and then we cut to a film crew shooting this as the films hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has to realize somethings wrong with her life or whatever,positive
its a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film with the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works though for the record last years deconstructing harry came awfully close,positive
what the hell has happened to him,positive
the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas,positive
bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off,positive
mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story,positive
everyone says i love you was more of a great idea than a great film,positive
even deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in a way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films,positive
if anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time its not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is its him,positive
celebrity is yes a good film but its only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film,positive
instead of creating the great woody allen world hes created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about,positive
and hes fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections,positive
its like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis,positive
woody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead,positive
much has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branaghs performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots o hand gestures is hardly a wartsandall impersonation,positive
branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his characters flaws to be more apparent,positive
woodys a flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because hes really funny and really witty and really intelligent,positive
branaghs allen is a bit more flatout bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but were still not sure if hes really a good person or not,positive
his character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off to interview griffith who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her and she denies him sorta,positive
we then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a midlife crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion,positive
he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script a bank robbery movie but with a deep personal crisis,positive
as such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on a quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film,positive
after griffith comes his escapades with a model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita,positive
following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen a relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom he fancies most of all,positive
his story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status,positive
while lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy ive become the kind of woman ive always hated and,positive
im loving it,positive
without doing a thing,positive
the result is a film of highs and mediums,positive
the mediums are what take up most of the film with sitations and scenes which dont exactly work but you cant help but pat allen on the back for trying,positive
but other places are really great scenes,positive
the opening,positive
the sequence with theron which is so good that i wished it hadnt ended,positive
a banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll as ever,positive
and perhaps the best sequence a romp with hotashell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so undicaprioesque that if any of this fans could sit through this film theyd never look at him the same way,positive
he ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on a wild allday ride with him,positive
they go to atlantic city to watch a fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies,positive
allens writing in these scenes are so good that just for them id almost recommend the film,positive
almost,positive
but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that its a mess despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself its still a smart and insightful film,positive
though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem to be if it were itd be extremely outoftouch but about those who want to be celebrities and how they equate celebrityhood with happiness,positive
we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if theyre really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character,positive
lee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes is at arms length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself,positive
besides its witty and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allens that great woody allen feel,positive
it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as a part of woody allens oeuvre its merely a blip no annie hall but its no shadows and fog either but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice,positive
set in the wild west this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid sidney james and his cronies in stodge city,positive
his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke kenneth williams so much that he asks sheriff albert earp jon pertwee to drive rumpo out of town,positive
instead the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead,positive
therefore judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city,positive
due to a misunderstanding an english sanitary engineer called marshall p knutt jim dale is assigned without knowing it as the law marshall for stodge city,positive
he arrives at the same time as annie oakley angela douglas who is seeking revenge for her father the sheriffs murder,positive
when marshall arrives at stodge city he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong,positive
in the end there is a headtohead between rumpo and marshall,positive
with the rumpos past experience it would seem that marshall is out of his depth but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley he at least stands some chance,positive
sid james with an american accent is perfect as the rumpo kid a part which suits him down to the ground,positive
jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter,positive
other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw in his debut as big heap and little heap respectively,positive
big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing as is his performance he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past,positive
joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid,positive
however the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary and pertwees performance is rather poor,positive
kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the judge,positive
even so this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams favourite,positive
a very different carry on film in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on,positive
the death count is the highest of any carry on film,positive
sets costumes and action sequences are all very commendable,positive
the songs that are included in the movie the title song and annies song are very impressive,positive
a strange but therefore very interesting carry on film,positive
not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series,positive
the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies ive seen in years,positive
but then again ive always had this phobia of asian born horror films,positive
i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced longhaired floating ghosts donning their white gownseuuugh,positive
the ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended,positive
unlike the horror films coming from the west im pretty much used to the gore and visual effects so much so they become rather bland nowadays,positive
theres really no scary movie from the west for a long time,positive
if you have something in mind please tell me,positive
this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by the stephen king of japan which is also i heard televised over the air in japan,positive
the film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it one week prior to viewing,positive
a journalist and her husband stupid enough tests the so call urban legend and ends up having a week before she meets her doom,positive
she and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves,positive
the ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today,positive
visual subtlety minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film,positive
very well done indeed especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore,positive
now thats something budding horror filmmaker wannabes should consider looking into,positive
just an idea of how visually powerful the film is it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese both of which i cant understand at all ok i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching but he revealed very little,positive
the twists in the plot leading to an unforgettable climax will definitely leave an impression on the audience will have you at the edge of your seat,positive
i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there isnt,positive
george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effectsbound flicks and he has done it again,positive
this is the first star wars film ive seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video,positive
what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its amazing visuals,positive
basically the films plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets,positive
quigon liam neeson and his young apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out with the animated jarjar binks to fix the mess that may result in war,positive
when their ship breaks down and they are stranded they find a young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother,positive
quigon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing,positive
anakin participates in a heartpounding podrace one of the highlights of the film to get the equipment needed to fix quigons ship,positive
however most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy,positive
meanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wits end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders,positive
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb,positive
this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made,positive
in all the star wars films human emotions that we the audience can identify with are usually nil but the films are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purposes,positive
despite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaws,positive
for starters we have the illconceived moronic character jarjar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience,positive
what a klutz,positive
george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as say yoda r2d2 or c3po but alas his efforts were in vain,positive
secondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movies atmosphere is so different from the familiar comicbook feel of the previous three star wars installments,positive
this is due perhaps to the utter complexity to this movies plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here,positive
the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions,positive
i cant say much about the acting though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway,positive
however there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and at times stale,positive
natalie portman has a great presence but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic unfeeling enigma,positive
there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance,positive
jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk,positive
despite the inevitable faults there is so much to enjoy about the movie,positive
the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesnt quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes but they are amazing and edgeofyourseat fun in their own rite,positive
the film is a treasure to look at,positive
the visual effects are astonishing 99 8 of the time the aweinspiring mouthopening eyepopping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius,positive
not since 1997s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one,positive
the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star wars movies kubricks 2001 maybe even of fritz langs classic silent metropolis,positive
however all the sets are so original,positive
the original star wars movies cant even match the grandeur of this films visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode,positive
the costumes are remarkable and have jeanpaul gaultier written all over them,positive
whether its queen amadalas gigantic wardrobe complete with goldembroidery and feathers or the jedis simple brown uniforms the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness,positive
the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie,positive
as for john williams score i dont think hes done one as complex or powerful since i cant even remember,positive
it is as epic as his schindlers list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws,positive
it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films but williams has added on made the music much more intense and moving,positive
what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed,positive
there is very little to hate in the film its a very accomplished and skillfully made flick,positive
it is the best fun film and the best bigbudget film out today most definitely,positive
not since 1996s shine which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of worldclass musicians,positive
in fact if one were to watch these films together it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills,positive
yet hilary and jackie the sophomore effort from director anand tucker has something more to say it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale,positive
emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale playing the sisters du pr,positive
both musicians from childhood hilary griffiths is renowned flutist while jacqueline watson is easily as skilled on the cello,positive
the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women both together and seperate,positive
their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one anothers and although their lives take very different paths hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour they are bound together by their deep family love,positive
the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance,positive
they contrast each other wonderfully and while watsons portrayal of jackie du pr is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic both characters are charged with emotion,positive
the frank cottrell boyce script which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well,positive
the script is also to be commended for its wellpolished dual nature,positive
cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert townes script for mission impossible and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame,positive
the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story,positive
some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised,positive
nevertheless hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around,positive
ive noticed something lately that ive never thought of before,positive
pseudo substance hollywood faking deep meanings in their films,positive
have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing,positive
more and more filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff,positive
im not trying to say city of angels is that bad,positive
it had a lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered,positive
somehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography,positive
the predictable ending that shattered our hopes even though we saw it coming only added to the disappointment,positive
but for over an hour city of angels is well worth the time,positive
nicolas cage is seth a guardian angel who like hundreds likely thousands or even millions of other angels spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life,positive
meg ryan in her most subdued performance yet plays maggie a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is were fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive,positive
after losing a patient on the surgery table these questions envelope maggie and seth the angel who was there to oversee the patients transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated by the doctor,positive
he begins following and observing maggie falling more and more in love with her everyday,positive
angels who we quickly learn are not and never were humans can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire,positive
seths adoration is too much to resist and eventually he does appear to maggie quite regularly although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community,positive
the angels are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities but its a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness,positive
cage is a wonderfully versatile actor think raising arizona and it could happen to you what a combo who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once,positive
its nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire,positive
the two arent very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy roles and its an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy,positive
but even though the two leads do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye,positive
its a shame that with so much going for it city of angels falters so much in its final stages leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there they just didnt know quite how to get to it,positive
they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high,positive
filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling us for 60 minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths,positive
based on the german film wings of desire that being the english title of course city of angels is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings even the devastatingly disappointing ending,positive
most movie goers the noncynics anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized,positive
nonetheless city of angels is beautifully captivating which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories,positive
when andy leaves for cowboy camp his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys,positive
one of these toys is wheezy a penguin with a broken squeaker,positive
woody tom hanks saddles up andys dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy,positive
woody succeeds in his mission but doesnt make it back to the house before al the unscrupulous owner of als toy barn recognizes woody as a rare collectors item and steals him,positive
buzz lightyear tim allen leads hamm john ratzenberger mr potato head don rickles slinky dog jim varney and rex wallace shawn into the city to find their friend,positive
meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped,positive
al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950s tv puppet show woodys roundup except for a woody doll,positive
now that the collection is complete al plans to sell woody and his roundup gangbullseye the horse jessie the cowgirl joan cusack and stinky pete the old prospector kelsey grammer to a toy museum in japan,positive
the gang is happy about the move theyve been in storage for years waiting for woody,positive
if woody doesnt go with them theyll be closed up in a dark box again possibly forever,positive
trying to convince him to stay with them jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered,positive
while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy buzz and the boys invade als toy barn where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesnt know hes a toy,positive
the new buzz generates the movies biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on zurgs fortress i e als apartment building,positive
the original toy story won me over because its central themes reflected a grownup sensibility rather than the usual thisiswhatwethinkkidswanttohear,positive
while most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill in toy story buzz discovered that he wasnt special that he was just like everyone else,positive
buzz sank into a suicidal depression but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy,positive
in other words its okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life,positive
most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that were not space rangers and were never going to be,positive
toy story 2 addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie,positive
woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded abandoned or sealed up in a dark box in the attic,positive
this is another big grownup theme everything ends,positive
the theme is introduced early in the movie when woodys arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp,positive
on the shelf woody meets wheezy whos dusty broken and forgotten,positive
the other toys are shocked that woody has been shelved and they worry that woodys ride out to the 25cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt,positive
after hes stolen woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals,positive
of course in spite of the heavy themes toy story 2 explores its also very funny,positive
most of the laughs come from the toys assault on als toy barn and on the apartment building,positive
the brief substitution of a new still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise id wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original,positive
most of the vocal performances are firstrate,positive
tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work,positive
however one voiceover also stands out as horribly miscast,positive
kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector,positive
although he does a lot of voiceover work in commercials and on the simpsons as sideshow bob grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice,positive
he doesnt have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete,positive
the animation is even better than in the first,positive
especially impressive were the textures of the figures,positive
we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic in the first movie the people looked just like the toys but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint,positive
we can also see that bo peep is porcelain,positive
as you can tell from the longwinded phrasing common in the merchandising disney and pixars toy story 2 this is pixars coming out party,positive
to celebrate they appended their first project a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball to the beginning of the movie,positive
they made the short in 1986 which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then,positive
on the downside toy story 2 follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale and some sections tend to drag,positive
overall though i had a great time and found story 2 to be a worthy successor to the first toy story,positive
bottom line this one really is fun for the whole family,positive
do film critics have morals,positive
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow,positive
naturally we dont want to go into a film with any preconceived notions which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish,positive
secondly and along the same line we cant prejudge a film because of its stars director etc the difference,positive
well in the first one wed go into a film thinking its going to be dumb or its going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so im not expecting much,positive
on the second hand were simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal grudge against the film company its made by disney,positive
oh its just a merchandising ploy then the actors jim carreys in it,positive
its gonna stink or the director who,positive
cant be that good,positive
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint,positive
make sense,positive
ok but what about comparing,positive
isnt that kind of along the same lines,positive
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composers credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair,positive
sure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more but what about jackie brown for example,positive
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both,positive
i think it is and ill tell you why,positive
a good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film,positive
sometimes that can be tough,positive
the acting was superb but i was bored or i loved it,positive
it was sooooo cheezy,positive
might be used to describe a film,positive
these are contradictions and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique,positive
but which is more important,positive
and which is better,positive
an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again,positive
getting back to the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because were reflecting what the public wants to know anyway,positive
every average person out there whos interested in this film is likely to ask how does it compare to pulp fiction,positive
and so as a critic im already responsible to ask that same question,positive
jackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the 1970s who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character,positive
tarantinos pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travoltas sudden revival in the movie industry and with talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier,positive
weve made it thru comparison 1 jackie is a 44yearold airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fictions samuel l jackson and comparison 2,positive
ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars,positive
trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed,positive
naturally this proves an obstacle to ordells plans and not as friendly intended as wed hope he posts jackies bail after she is put behind bars,positive
the thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions hes willing to kill anyone who stands in the way,positive
jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze,positive
ordell wont think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as shes always done yet at the same time a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided,positive
it comes down to a simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison,positive
what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself,positive
coming into play is another 70s veteran robert forster as jackies bail bondsmen max cherry,positive
maxs obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance,positive
also involved is ordells surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand,positive
fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role but theres nothing more to her and therefore she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters,positive
de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself,positive
de niro is a brilliant actor but a character who hardly ever speaks doesnt need a de niro to play him,positive
compared to pulp fiction comparison 3 the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable,positive
in pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldnt have suffered much with a lesser talented cast the exception being grier,positive
tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth,positive
sadly grier too could have received a bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newlyjarred perception of life,positive
jackson teams up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isnt as awesome as the first time,positive
jules was the rambling biblequoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off,positive
and although jackson is really really good in jackie brown i dont think hes quite as irreplaceable,positive
in fact maybe a new face would have been better,positive
jackson couldve remained tarantinos jules and a new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memories,positive
sadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just isnt as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules,positive
another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning,positive
this is griers film so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses,positive
it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story,positive
it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantinos quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonards novel rum punch,positive
for those moviegoers dont expect another pulp fiction and youll be satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90s film making,positive
the directing has toned down a bit however yet were still reminded that this is tarantinos movie thanks to odd splitscreen storytelling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints,positive
so getting back to the question that i began with this isnt pulp fiction at all,positive
its good but it isnt anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place,positive
this is a more conservative tarantino but not one that wont satiate true fans,positive
if you can realize that this isnt going to knock your socks off then youll be happy to at least let it massage your feet,positive
after all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy,positive
jake kasdan son of one of the best screenwriters around breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hardtocategorize detective story part mystery part comedy part character study and part romance,positive
for the most part kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film,positive
daryl zero bill pullman is a modern day sherlock holmes,positive
the parallel is present down to his love of music though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin and his addiction to drugs amphetamines rather than morphine,positive
he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces the case about the man who lied about his age or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes,positive
however zeros observance of the fine art of detachment though it makes him a brilliant private investigator makes him somewhat of a selfimposed outcast in society,positive
he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr watson i mean steve arlo ben stiller,positive
arlo is not happy with his job,positive
he is thrilled to be around zeros brilliance but his bizarre behavior and strange requests are frustrating to the former lawyer,positive
and theyre even more so to his girlfriend jess angela featherstone who is fed up that her boyfriends boss means more to arlo than her,positive
this is the situation when a new case comes knocking,positive
gregory stark ryan oneill hires zero to find his lost keys,positive
it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence,positive
now stark is being blackmailed and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end,positive
to solve this case zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell,positive
however this is when he is vulnerable and,positive
this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic gloria sullivan kim dickens who may be involved in the blackmail scheme,positive
for the first time zero has to question his own objectivity as he finds his client less and less sympathetic,positive
zero effect is weakest in its obviously wacky scenes depicting daryl zeros odd behavior,positive
such scenes might be appropriate in an outandout satire making zero an ace venturaish character,positive
however theres a much meatier movie in here it just takes a while to get out,positive
thats not to say that theres not a place for humor in this film,positive
in fact some of the best scenes are ben stillers wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer,positive
however the overthetop scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film and they arent funny enough to stand on their own,positive
once the investigation is underway however zeros brilliance really begins to shine,positive
his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlocks own,positive
as the mystery begins to unfold zeros deductions lead the plot in interesting directions but never lose the viewer,positive
zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well,positive
zeros relationship with gloria is lowkey but it hits all the right notes,positive
however we are always kept distant from glorias character,positive
shes given plenty of development but we never understand what she is thinking,positive
perhaps that may be intentional to place the audience in zeros zone of detachment,positive
but on the whole it is frustrating,positive
bill pullman when hes not spacing out creates a vibrant character in daryl zero,positive
theres one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years and it is shockingly moving expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character but one which fits in well,positive
and although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called zero seriously it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name,positive
although zero effect is a bit awkward in places it is a strong debut for kasdan and shows great promise,positive
the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster,positive
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman,positive
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider,positive
when those observers are joel and ethan coen the surreal becomes bizarre,positive
when the life is that of jeff the dude leboswki the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of whatsgoingonaroundhere,positive
the marvelous sound of the stranger sam elliot s voiceover introduces the film,positive
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up,positive
the dude jeff bridges is described as the laziest man in los angeles possibly the world although hes not so much slothful as he is relaxed,positive
spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other he doesnt have much of a life but hes having a good time,positive
when asked what he does for fun he responds bowl drive around and the occasional acid flashback,positive
lebowskis passion is bowling,positive
when hes not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike things just happen to him,positive
arriving home one night hes beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them,positive
even worse they urinate on his rug,positive
the problem is that the dude doesnt have a wife,positive
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment,positive
the big lebowski david huddleston is a multimillionaire and his dudeness lives in tworoom squalor,positive
the next day our ragtag hero visits his namesakes mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug,positive
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together not surprisingly since its virtually the only object there,positive
when hes denied any money he picks up a replacement rug off the floor,positive
on his way out he runs into lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny tara reid who offers to perform a sexual act that according to rumor is one of bill clintons favorites for a thousand bucks,positive
the penniless dude wisecracks that hes heading for the cash machine,positive
later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunnys kidnappers,positive
this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences,positive
the kidnappers are impossibly inept,positive
the dude and his cronies are even worse,positive
every plan goes awry,positive
you can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues,positive
thats the story but to tell the truth it doesnt much matter,positive
there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining,positive
the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into,positive
the dudes bowling buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi look like people youd see on the street but like everything else in this film theyre not quite what they seem,positive
walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties,positive
everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam,positive
when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but wont admit it walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet,positive
donny gets precious few words in between walters screaming and the dudes rambling,positive
when he does walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns,positive
donny is out of his league and doesnt have a frame of reference,positive
the film is peppered with people for whom the term character would be an understatement,positive
the big lebowskis daughter maude an avantgarde vaginal artist paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an sm mary martin,positive
the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers,positive
bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star,positive
most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler,positive
as the flamenco music swells we see him putting on his lavender hose,positive
the camera pans up to an allpurple skintight bowling outfit with jesus pronounced with a j not an h embroidered on the pocket,positive
he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail,positive
his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball,positive
bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has,positive
i cant think of anyone else who could have done a better job,positive
buscemi has a limited role but he plays it perfectly,positive
the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that hes one of the treasures of our time,positive
its odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barrs television husband,positive
more like the coens raising arizona than their hit fargo the big lebowski demands an open mind and even more open eyes,positive
a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss,positive
theres so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it,positive
walking out of the theater i felt that the film had something important to say,positive
on further examination i wasnt sure exactly what it was,positive
if you meet jesus at the bowling alley its not going to be what you expect,positive
when the going gets weird the weird go bowling,positive
maybe theres no real message,positive
perhaps its just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world,positive
maybe thats enough,positive
michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about the man in the iron mask starring that favorite of 14yearold girls of all ages,positive
redman com is the eaddress for estuff,positive
assume nothing,positive
the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990s as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be,positive
the phrase especially goes for oscar novak an architect who is the main focus of three to tango a delightful funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself,positive
novak matthew perry a shy clumsy chicago based architect along with openly gay partner peter steinberg oliver platt fights for projects day in and day out,positive
one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman dylan mcdermott a rich wellknown businessman,positive
charles immediately takes a liking to oscar as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor,positive
seeing oscar as someone he could trust charles asks him to watch his girlfriend an unpredictable adventurous girl named amy post neve campbell who makes a living by blowing glass,positive
charles wants to know who she talks to what she does and where she goes,positive
the point,positive
to make sure shes not seeing someone else of course,positive
oscar gladly takes the job and meets amy at an art show of hers and sparks fly between the two from the get go,positive
oscar feels he has found the one meant for him and he is content with the idea of being with amy,positive
well another popular phrase of the 90s is all good things must come to an end and this stays true for oscar as well,positive
charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night as oscar and amy have become great friends but he doesnt seem to mind,positive
why is this,positive
he thinks oscar is gay,positive
hes not afraid to share this with him either,positive
oscar stands in shock after the words i swear if you werent gay oscar id have to kill you are muttered flamboyantly from charles mouth,positive
the word spreads instantly through town,positive
will oscar come out of his supposed gayness or will he tell everyone that he isnt,positive
one would immediately think he would deny the fact but numerous occurrences come to oscar which result in the fact that if he denies the fact he could lose his job with charles,positive
matthew perry doesnt escape his character as chandler on the already classic t v,positive
comedy friends as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless shy and sensitive,positive
nonetheless perry is hilarious here and shows that he can handle drama as obviously his character suffers quite a bit here,positive
its wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie she was the star of scream 1 and 2 and the upcoming scream 3 as she handles comedy superbly here,positive
her voice smile and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies stay with this genre neve,positive
neve is delightful as her conflicted character who feels love for oscar but knows based on rumors that he is gay,positive
as usual campbell is likable as her likable character,positive
unlike the other two leads here dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue and is never convincing,positive
when his character his present mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting,positive
stick to the t v,positive
drama the practice dylan,positive
the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano,positive
no originality or technique is used whatsoever,positive
three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy or else the film would have been a disaster as it is just plain boring to look at,positive
three to tango is a film done many times before as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998s the object of my affection but the plot has never been completed so well,positive
three to tangos script written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun fast and funny delivering not only original hilarious gay jokes not your run of the mill material but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling,positive
unlike last summers south park bigger longer and uncut and 1997s in out three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar,positive
the script is wise to take this route as gays cant i dont think so anyway be offended by this light playful comedy,positive
to prove this a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly,positive
three to tangos climax is a hilarious clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romanticmistaken identity comedies,positive
three to tango is a gem,positive
the bottom line three to tango is a light sharp snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending and great stars,positive
one of the better romantic comedies of 1999,positive
i know what i would do with 4 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site especially if i were with jacob and lou,positive
huh,positive
well in any event that is the situation hank paxton finds himself in,positive
he and his dimwitted brother jacob thorton and tubby friend lou brent briscoe come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck,positive
against his better judgement hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities,positive
the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret and is it worth it,positive
a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things clay pigeons and even fargo and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle,positive
oh and its much better than any of those,positive
sam raimi took a departure from his normal freakshow horrormonkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture,positive
he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do,positive
i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course,positive
one of the films components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malicks the thin red line,positive
in malicks three hour boreathon he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story,positive
it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass a small bird or a flowing body of water,positive
sure there were obvious metaphorical connections but there was no subtlty to his efforts,positive
raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters,positive
i think most viewers may miss the comparison but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film,positive
and then theres billy bob thorton who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood,positive
if it can continute to produce people like thorton hollywood will be ok,positive
he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here,positive
it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade but is is just as complex if not more so,positive
jacob is slow and simple and yet we so often see him deep in thought,positive
i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say or didnt know how to say or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said,positive
here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry,positive
though the plot is somewhat unoriginal it has a very appealing new twist in its characters,positive
paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group a far cry from chet in wierd science,positive
perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advicegiving wife but she certainly doesnt do anything ruin the picture,positive
a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty unredeeming,positive
but at least this one has an important message unlike so many of its counterparts,positive
ingredients lost parrot trying to get home friends,positive
synopsis a russian janitor named misha tony shalhoub discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility,positive
paulie the talking parrot the voice of jay mohr soon regales misha with his life story,positive
as a young bird paulie is raised by marie hallie kate eisenberg a little girl with a speech impediment,positive
by attending maries speech lessons paulie learns to like a regular person,positive
unfortunately after being unfairly blamed for an accident paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold,positive
paulies biggest wish is to return to marie,positive
many years later and after a succession of memorable owners gena rowlands cheech marin and jay mohr paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry,positive
he is sent to a cruel research facility where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement,positive
will misha help paulie get back to marie,positive
opinion every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities some wellmeaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular,positive
soon enough birthday kid loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound a victim of neglect,positive
my sister owns a real paulie it thinks like a parrot bites like a parrot and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant,positive
please think twice before buying one,positive
okay back to the story,positive
in movies parrots usually play support characters but paulie might be the first movie where the animatronic bird gets main billing,positive
paulie like those side characters in disney cartoons is cute and sassy a strutting miniature human,positive
actually paulie is the voice of jay mohr he played jennifer anistons boyfriend on picture perfect doing his best buddy hackett impression which is interesting since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner and mohr doubles as a customer,positive
paulie is for kids,positive
while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a stupid furball,positive
sometimes however there are statements the kids dont get,positive
for example when paulies elderly owner ivy gena rowlands dies paulie explains well one day the cat got her,positive
and you hear kids exclaim what cat,positive
imagine lassie come home except with a dollsized human dressed as a bird and youll have a good idea of the plot and characterization,positive
bird tries to get home,positive
bird meets elderly friend,positive
bird loses elderly friend,positive
bird meets eccentric friend,positive
bird loses eccentric friend,positive
bird meets bad influence,positive
and so on and so forth with paulie meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie trini alvarado,positive
the bottom line,positive
break out the popcorn money moms and dads,positive
paulie may be the low end version of lassie bambi or babe but hell do,positive
sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads but im sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person paulie trying to get home meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way,positive
and good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy well one day the cat got her,positive
one of the best movies ive ever seen,positive
id heard extremely good things about this movie and though the previews didnt really intrigue that much it was a movie id been anticipating for a few months now,positive
for some reason im not sure of this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u s it was a definite hit with the critics but didnt exactly set any box office records,positive
after viewing this incredibly well directed written and acted movie i cant help but wonder why,positive
the strength of this film is its gritty realism,positive
the main characters are all human with individual flaws no stereotype hollywood heroes,positive
you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life but that is what makes it so real,positive
i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller but i was mistaken,positive
even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase,positive
and the ending whoa,positive
ive never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly,positive
the three male leads guy pearce kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific,positive
the best actor oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue but there is one problem there,positive
how could they have chosen between these three actors,positive
there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two,positive
its impossible,positive
kim bassingers performance is also a revelation,positive
id never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was well whats the word a twinky,positive
that impression has changed as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly,positive
the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding,positive
no cardboard characters here,positive
the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences,positive
pearces interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant,positive
i really cant fault this movie at all,positive
i was so glad to see fellow australians pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie,positive
i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films but had not seen much of guy pearce,positive
i intend to change this next time i visit the video store,positive
after having heard so many critics describe return to me as an oldfashioned hollywood romance i kept asking myself going into this movie what exactly is an oldfashioned hollywood romance,positive
what made return to me oldfashioned and oldhollywood,positive
was it the tunes from sinatra etc legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on,positive
was it the glamorous sophisticated feel,positive
the charisma of the two leads,positive
even now i cant say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer because i havent see that many oldfashioned hollywood romances,positive
i dont think any of the romances ive seen have been classified as such,positive
which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics return to me was oldfashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider,positive
it was traditional magical,positive
we knew it couldnt be too daring or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in,positive
it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity tenderness and love from director bonnie hunt that it couldnt help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings,positive
the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunts direction,positive
from the very first birds eye view of chicago zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland david duchovny accompanied by the return to me ballad by whom we can tell were in for something sweet,positive
the scenes between the characters are endearing truthful with just a hint of fantasy,positive
real people dont act that way real people arent that nice,positive
we know all this and yet we want to believe in these folks existence,positive
the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale but hunts rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal,positive
everything is ordinaryyet beautifulin this film,positive
from the festive little family restaurant to grace minnie driver and bobs wardrobes,positive
from the eloquent notinahurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints,positive
from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen the most beautiful part,positive
return to me has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist,positive
we care for them laugh with them cry with them were concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father,positive
whatever hunt did she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors,positive
disappointingly david alan griers charlie however much i like him was the most flatlywritten,positive
duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona with the help of his fellow costars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder,positive
instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of the xfiles,positive
duchovny who is excellent at understatement and selfdeprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen,positive
minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer,positive
though an unlikely pair duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses,positive
while return to me functions remarkably as a laughoutloud comedy a romantic scenic tour through chicago and a tearjerker the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop,positive
the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wifes heart,positive
we already know that theres going to be a happy ending we feel like we spend the entire film however enjoyably in a straight line going towards that point,positive
as a result bob and grace click almost too quicklyyes i know shes supposed to have his exwifes heart and everythingit seems too effortless,positive
the main subject is a love story and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters whose story might not have that much meat after all,positive
however in the spirit of return to me it wont do to be too picky about how old hollywood tells its stories,positive
i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt,positive
it shows,positive
the bottom line return to me is nothing remarkable and yet its sweetness sincerity and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadnt imagined,positive
are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store,positive
wafflemovies com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves,positive
everyweek wafflemovies com,positive
reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video,positive
here is a sample review,positive
welcome to sarajevo,positive
in light of americas recent intervention in kosovo welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years,positive
set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war,positive
the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding,positive
as they make their way down the street a sniper shoots the mother of the bride,positive
yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war,positive
in this scene we meet joe flynn woody harrelson an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church,positive
joe is cocky but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesnt even know,positive
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson stephen dillane,positive
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the worlds lack of interest,positive
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mothers death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread,positive
he decides to take action when a united nations delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth,positive
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines,positive
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult,positive
during his visits he befriends a preteen girl emira emira nuseric who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner,positive
he promises to get emira out of harms way if he gets the chance,positive
after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children henderson loses hope,positive
however his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina marisa tomei and her childrens aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans,positive
unfortunately only babies are wanted for adoption so henderson pledges to take emira to england,positive
the group of children nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy,positive
can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps,positive
the movie was beautifully and sensitively made,positive
director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred,positive
they show the destroyed lives families that have been split up and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with,positive
this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson his producer and flynn have befriended,positive
the group of twentysomethings reside in a bombed out bar without lifes simplest pleasures and amenities,positive
one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth,positive
like the rest of those deeply effected by the war this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live,positive
winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room,positive
the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics,positive
winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities,positive
this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies com,positive
selection mad city,positive
we watch them struggle to cover the horror while trying to remain professionally detached,positive
however they are human and question the reason behind it all why no one cares and how they can get out,positive
stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson,positive
he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events,positive
dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy,positive
henderson realizes that he cannot save the world but he can help a few,positive
it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis learysandra bullock disaster two if by sea,positive
woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest most versatile actors of his generation,positive
harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the characters caring nature and vulnerability shine through,positive
harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men cheers white men cant jump as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one,positive
this ability will serve him well and give him a long successful career,positive
americas involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place,positive
for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict the entire movie most importantly the opening scenes provide a history lesson,positive
war is a foreign concept to most of us in america,positive
battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to,positive
televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war,positive
this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world something we dont do enough of in 90s america,positive
countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally,positive
luckily movie reviewers arent burdened with such legislation,positive
otherwise small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer,positive
in case of star wars 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas the consequences would be even more severe because that film is very special for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of fans,positive
in any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best if not the best film of all times,positive
those who dont usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery,positive
the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold objective standards in reviewing this film,positive
like so many previous reviewers i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since,positive
perhaps it was childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago in a galaxy far away,positive
or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before,positive
anyway watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life,positive
and it was also unmatched for many years to come because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas epic,positive
star wars wasnt just important movie for me or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment,positive
it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema,positive
until than american motion picture industry was in a limbo social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood and new authors filled the void mostly by using hollywoods financial and technical resources to create serious personal or artsy movies,positive
as a result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate didnt want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen,positive
george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue,positive
the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed by supplement industry of toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began to change the face of hollywood,positive
serious adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced by industrial products of blockbuster philosophy,positive
one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre,positive
until 1977 science fiction movies were mostly in bproduction domain,positive
in late 1960s bigger budgets for science fiction didnt look so strange anymore thanks to the great success of 2001 a space odyssey,positive
but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production mostly dark dystopic movies,positive
however in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually doesnt like it,positive
as a result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s,positive
after that science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment,positive
ironically the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of new hollywood generation of young movie authors who made artsy and personal films in early 1970s,positive
george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 and nostalgic drama american graffiti,positive
both movies were considered personal in its time despite latter one becoming very popular,positive
in a sense star wars is an also very personal film and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it not for it,positive
but unlike many personal movies of the era its personality was in line with the wishes of the general audience,positive
the plot set a long time ago in a galaxy far away begins in a time of civil war,positive
the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic,positive
in order to quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets,positive
the information about death star acquired by rebel intelligence is being transported by princess leia organa carrie fisher when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser,positive
princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots c3po anthony daniels and r2d2 kenny baker,positive
those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker mark hamill young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot,positive
his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi alec guiness,positive
old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force,positive
after some hesitation luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess while the old man would teach him the ways of the force,positive
their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew,positive
critics who dont like the movie especially those who cant forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of new hollywood are prone to point the lack of originality,positive
on the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawas samurai classic the hidden fortress,positive
on the other hand those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted by some mild tolkien references,positive
the others would find the authors element within the story star wars could be seen as an anti establishment film young longhaired easy going natureloving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes,positive
even out of its historical or social context star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art,positive
george lucas direction is very good with the clever editing and a wellpaced segments between action and dramatic buildup,positive
characters are welldrawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster,positive
we have a comingofage hero damselindistress somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two nonhuman characters,positive
some of the actors are very good alec guiness in his most famous role to date james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form,positive
unfortunately the same cant be said for the main leads among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character threedimensional enough to launch his further acting career,positive
the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology,positive
often comparisons with 2001 space odyssey another groundbreaking sf film were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick,positive
however the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly yet they arent the most remembered trademark of the movie,positive
that honour should definitely go to the oscar winning soundtrack by john williams whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career,positive
newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release,positive
yet even if they are immune to the george lucas magic they should watch this film nevertheless perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture,positive
according to hollywood movies made in last few decades life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being,positive
even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark godforsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience,positive
on the other hand it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view,positive
this film is amarcord 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life,positive
the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense,positive
instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs as well as series of local often very colourful characters,positive
although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist 14year old boy titta played by bruno zanin and chronicles his sexual frustrations obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca played by magali noel problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family as well as troubles his father played by armando brancia have with mussolinis fascist regime,positive
amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film and it probably explains why it is very popular even among those people who actually dont like federico fellinis work very much,positive
every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible,positive
distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film word amarcord is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase i remember in local italian dialect,positive
in the same way the word is distorted so is the past in memories of those who remember it,positive
after the premiere fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film but it doesnt matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellinis childhood or not any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film,positive
fellinis views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film,positive
even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images,positive
characters look like caricatures actors playing them often deliberately overact and women especially those who fuel tittas sexual fantasies often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions,positive
every now and then scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movies characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters visions,positive
because of that almost everything in this film looks different and in most cases better than it would have looked in the real life,positive
even the fascism gets fellinian makeover fellini views mussolinis totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history and opportunity for comedy,positive
when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour,positive
unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda fellini doesnt care that much about politics,positive
lack of selfrighteous moral perspective is compensated with fellinis humanistic approach to his characters,positive
each of them regardless of age gender social class or physical appearance is given opportunity to express his or her views dreams and fears,positive
fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people,positive
because of this warmth and democratic spirit amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable melancholic and even tragic moments,positive
fellini couldnt produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie,positive
vignettes arent memorable because of the characters only fellini uses camera painting film in bright colours especially in the scenes that depict characters fantasies,positive
fellini also knows how to use locations whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel brightcoloured beach or rural countryside,positive
even the downtoearth streets of rimini where everyone knows everyone gets magical dimension during the snowfall,positive
on the other hand lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene,positive
this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellinis longtime associate nino rota,positive
his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced,positive
that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art,positive
everyone knows someone like giles death stuffy arrogant set in his ways and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with progress,positive
giles is a writer but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis,positive
his house looks like an immaculate museum with no television microwave word processor or other technological gadgets only the electric lights betray that hes living in the twentieth century not the nineteenth,positive
this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype but john hurt in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career turns erstwhile fogy giles into a threedimensional human being,positive
despite his tunnel vision its impossible not to like the man especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune love,positive
and as giles discovers during the course of this amusing warmhearted motion picture its possible to find the object of ones affection in the most unusual places,positive
giles who is a widower and a recluse does not frequent the cinema but when he learns that an e m forster film is playing at the local theater he screws up his courage and decides to go,positive
what he doesnt realize is that the movie house is showing two films the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii,positive
a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress,positive
just as giles is about to leave however he notices ronnie bostock jason priestley and suddenly its love at first sight,positive
giles is enraptured and the moment hotpants college ii is over he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia including teen magazines and video tapes,positive
in order to watch those tapes giles must buy a vcr but he initially doesnt realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr,positive
eventually not satisfied with being the worlds foremost authority on bostock giles boards a plane and travels to long island where his idols home is located,positive
bostock is away when giles arrives but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnies supermodel girlfriend audrey fiona loewi,positive
eventually the actor arrives home and impressed with giles demeanor and intelligence he begins to rely on the older mans advice,positive
but while giles affection runs deep ronnies feelings are less constant,positive
love and death on long island is a comedy and a very funny one at that,positive
in fact for its first half the film is nearlyperfect,positive
it suffers a falloff once giles reaches new york and the ending with its nonetoosubtle homosexual overtones is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it,positive
in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom richard kwietniowski adapting from the novel by gilbert adair is 100 on target,positive
in the process he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles but says a few things about the transforming power of love even if it is unrequited,positive
from start to finish this is clearly hurts movie hes in almost every frame,positive
its a role that the veteran actor must have relished because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure and does so by means of dialogue delivery body language and everchanging facial expressions,positive
jason priestley cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie,positive
he is charismatic and its not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie,positive
meanwhile solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the alwaysreliable maury chaykin,positive
love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one a social commentary it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment a buddy story ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days and a fish out of water tale victorian relic giles forced into the modern world,positive
yet despite the many laughs love and death offers it never takes cheap shots,positive
it has a vibrant beating heart and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile,positive
every once in a while a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise,positive
i dont necessarily mean in terms of quality rather im referring to the mere knowledge of its existence,positive
usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo,positive
it has slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined to slip out just as quietly,positive
thats a shame because princess caraboo is a delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing,positive
whats more its surprisingly insightful and provides a sharpwitted lesson in english social history,positive
princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england involving a young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside,positive
apparently unable to speak any english she is taken in by goodhearted gentlewoman mrs worrall wendy hughes,positive
her banker husband jim broadbent is nonetoopleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo,positive
this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs worrall,positive
however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo,positive
as a social satire and comedy of manners princess caraboo is a winner,positive
it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing,positive
but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude,positive
he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mrs worrall he is a bit too close to them for comfort,positive
while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and cowriter michael austin keeps the treatment too lighthearted to be heavyhanded,positive
he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes as the princess becomes a sensation at court,positive
in one of the films best sequences princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance,positive
it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in sensations an idea that takes on a timeless quality and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show,positive
social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment,positive
the performers are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime,positive
her supporting players are also appealing wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs worrall kevin kline as frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea as the worldweary but ultimately romantic gutch,positive
only john lithgow is a disappointment turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princesss identity,positive
the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky,positive
it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isnt given more time to develop because the potential seemed to be there,positive
when it finally does blossom it seems too quick to be plausible,positive
princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp,positive
still it has both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out,positive
it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewardinga hidden gem,positive
in my review of theres something about mary i said something to the effect of laughter isnt everything,positive
i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate laughter isnt everything unless im watching a jim abrahams film,positive
see spoofs are easy with me,positive
i love movies and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love,positive
sometimes im the only one in the theater laughing,positive
sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so highpitched in comparison to my speaking voice it cuts right through everyone elses laughter,positive
sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film,positive
abrahams latest film mafia induced this kind of hysteria upon me,positive
its gotten some mediocre reviews but hey im the guy who laughs at everything,positive
there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film but there are far more that work and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness,positive
i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thoughtprovoking,positive
most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things like develop characters shape stories and other such nonsense,positive
mafia,positive
has no pretentions about characters or story and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh,positive
the film begins on the perfect high note with a mockery of the opening of casino,positive
our hero jay mohr is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire,positive
to describe the story of mafia,positive
is absurd and pointless but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films with a lot of casino references inserted throughout,positive
along the way the parodies seem arbitrary and rarely victimize mob films pictures like the english patient forrest gump and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing,positive
movies like this rely on just a few things but the most important element is direction,positive
abrahams has been down this path many times before hot shots top secret airplane and any other film with an exclamation point in the title and so i hold most of the success of mafia,positive
to his experience,positive
he takes just the right attitude in each scene and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic but it never develops,positive
the actors are all energetic which helps a lot with the tone of the film,positive
mohr suicide kings paulie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors is so good here,positive
he looks like hes having so much fun that hes containing his laughter in every scene watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool,positive
hes probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material,positive
lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brandos godfather while pamela gidley is deadon in a fullblown mockery of sharon stone,positive
the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that im supposed to give examples of things and be specific,positive
unfortunately i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia,positive
that i cant remember a lot of what made me laugh,positive
but thats a good sign mafia,positive
is so funny that i wasnt even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory,positive
i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain,positive
i know that doesnt sound particularly complimentary but when watching a dumb comedy like this the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain,positive
finally a film that does this for me,positive
i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool,positive
i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage grousing to myself about its transparently planes trains and automobiles plot machinations and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement,positive
this was a mass market romantic comedy after all a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and even in its best days worked hard to perpetuate the romance infatuation paradigm,positive
then marc lawrence did something wonderful something which made the entire film click into place he showed me a comic love story about grownups,positive
it certainly didnt look that way from the outset which introduces groomtobe ben holmes ben affleck at his bachelor party surrounded by friends and family whooping over his last night of freedom,positive
ben loves his fiancee bridget maura tierney but the doomandgloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this till death do you part business,positive
then on an illfated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah ben meets sarah lewis sandra bullock a freespirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her,positive
as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn ben and sarah begin a threeday southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger ben seeing in sarah the chances hes never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability shes never had,positive
forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue,positive
ben is an ideal role for afflecks easygoing charm and he plays the straightlaced straight man without forced exasperation,positive
sandra bullock for her part is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last halfdozen films combined avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping,positive
the two performances part of a great toptobottom cast are effective and connected from the start yet the scripts apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely,positive
lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like selfjustification,positive
the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution,positive
forces of nature isnt about a man developing a fear of commitment its about a man learning what commitment means to him learning that its not what he thought it was,positive
lawrences script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense,positive
earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine,positive
though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that youll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom,positive
that is provided youre not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes,positive
for a brisk romantic comedy forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most overdirected scenes of the year teetering handheld shots whynot low or high angles sweeping pans,positive
occasionally the hyperreal approach works with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance far more often hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is covering it with flourishes so thick you almost cant find whats underneath,positive
a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director but even hughes excesses cant spoil this unique concoction,positive
forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents,positive
garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there,positive
shandling is chosen for the mission is given the name harold anderson and is set up as a banker in seattle,positive
after a few disastrous mating attempts he figures his best bet will be susan annette bening a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she wont have sex again until she gets married,positive
the leader of harolds planet ben kingsley tells him to marry her and harold is soon exposed to all the joys of married life,positive
despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s what planet are you from,positive
is a very funny movie,positive
the plot which the film wisely doesnt linger on the specifics of for too long is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes most of which work very well,positive
the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead,positive
but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role and its his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive,positive
plus if you think about it what planet are you from,positive
could have very easily gone the grossout route considering that shandlings character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited,positive
we never see anything though its all implied which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness,positive
im glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of less is more,positive
the talented supporting cast certainly adds to ones enjoyment of this film,positive
annette bening oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks,positive
does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor,positive
she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of high hopes for a lengthy period of time,positive
ben kingsley john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well and linda fiorentino,positive
good lord there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy,positive
everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality,positive
what planet are you from,positive
is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video,positive
the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and enhanced for 16x9 televisions,positive
also included on the disc as extras a decent makingof featurette an isolated score track talent files for the cast and crew and the films original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for wolf men in black bugsy and as good as it gets,positive
when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track i actually laughed,positive
how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get its own isolated track,positive
well as it turns out its a mighty fine score from carter burwell fargo the hudsucker proxy that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review,positive
kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc,positive
what planet are your from,positive
was unjustly ignored in theaters and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video,positive
this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it,positive
r,positive
buffalo 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci,positive
gallo plays a very troubled man who was sent to jail for gambling,positive
once out of jail he must visit his parents who he told he was married,positive
the truth is he isnt married,positive
to try to impress them he kidnaps a girl christina ricci from a tap dancing class to act as his wife,positive
the film is very cheaply made and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie but you dont need money to make a good film,positive
buffalo 66 doesnt always stay with the realistic concept and sometimes goes through outrageous events,positive
gallos parents played by angelica huston and ben gazarra are two very strange individuals,positive
the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits,positive
gallo and ricci arrive at his parents house and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house,positive
riccis performance during the scene at gallos parents home are very well done,positive
there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes,positive
the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative,positive
they seemed very mediocre but they worked out just fine,positive
gallos character is developed very well,positive
the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear,positive
gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through,positive
his character goes through many many problems just like many people in real life,positive
this character seemed very realistic to me,positive
riccis character is funny and different,positive
she doesnt care much that she has been kidnaped in fact she falls in love the man who kidnaped her,positive
ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves,positive
buffalo 66 isnt all laughs though,positive
many scenes are very dramatic and depressing,positive
gallos character was so realistic he was extremely disturbing,positive
some scenes are supposed to come off as funny but they actually seemed sad and real to life,positive
the film sometimes drags along not giving much material,positive
i really would have liked to see gallos parents a lot more and i would have liked to see the characters developed more,positive
overall buffalo 66 isnt as good as some people put it up to be,positive
the bottom line a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom,positive
wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say,positive
this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and thats too long for this epicwannabe that plays more like a tv miniseries than a movie,positive
the story opens on the earp family farm with young wyatt ready to run away from home,positive
he wants to fight in the civil war but his dad hackman has different ideas and wants his son to study law,positive
time passes and wyatt heads west returns home to marry and after a spell begins his career in law enforcement,positive
by the time he costner and his brothers madsen david andrews and linden ashby arrive in tombstone wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards,positive
wyatt earp is very appealing in places such as cast costumes and cinematography but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact,positive
who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches,positive
somber is fine just ask clint eastwood but this film that boasts not one not two but three count em three hammy death scenes,positive
still a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff,positive
his uh unusual relations with women for example are an intriguing contrast to his characters credo of nothing counts as much as blood,positive
equally amusing is a buffalohunting and skinning,positive
sequence that is decidedly nonpc,positive
director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay,positive
the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief devoid of almost any theatrics,positive
dont look for much glorified violence here,positive
despite some large exclamation points in the story the characters do come to life,positive
the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley to mackenzie astin,positive
kevin costner is very good in the title role,positive
dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires though but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch,positive
he was tougher in a perfect world,positive
his foil is dennis quaid who pulled a deniro by losing 40 pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday,positive
gaunt and gamely hes a scene stealer whos seen too little,positive
other familiar faces include tom sizemore looking like bruce mcgill bill pullman looking like jeff daniels and lea thompson looking like someone other than lea thompson,positive
both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic while late entries catherine ohara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid,positive
though the story and score shouldve tried less is more all other credits are technical tops,positive
production designer ida random art director gary wissner and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what mustve been an enormous budget,positive
clearly no expense was spared,positive
plot a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention,positive
the boys eventually get together to split the money but as plans change doublecrosses occur dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road,positive
whos on the up and up whos the real bad guy and whos gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie,positive
critique the funnest movie that ive seen so far this year,positive
its got style its got tough guys talkin shite and its got plenty of bullets to go around,positive
a definite hunkahunka burnin adventure,positive
a guys guy movie through and through and one thatll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff,positive
its not very original it goes on for a little too long but costner and russell make it happen as two shitekickin elvis lovers who dont stop till they more or less drop,positive
this movies got some pretty intensive shootout scenes one of the coolest robbery scenarios that ive ever witnessed featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the kings music playing in the background and a decent helping of doublecrosses sharp dialogue and funny moments,positive
in fact even though the cast is filled with many name actors bactors as they might be for the most part most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim,positive
but the true glue that holds this film together other than the spirit of elvis himself is costner and russell who play their badass characters to the t sure russells been down this road before but costner surprised me with his nastiness,positive
i guess hes pissed at all the boxoffice bombs that hes been in of late but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here,positive
in the end the bottom line with this movie is having fun kickin ass and making sure theres enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards,positive
and smoke em if you got em folks,positive
there is also this one really great showdown scene between costner and a cop thatll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time,positive
the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack thatll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next,positive
it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background with plenty and i mean plenty of camera tricks cuts and edits but for this kind of flick it actually works,positive
the film is not perfect though it starts off with a pretty big bang but then pulls a way of the gun on us and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle while characters intermingle and disperse,positive
i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well,positive
and did i mention that courteney cox looked megahot in the movie,positive
no okay,positive
well i just did,positive
i coulda done without her whole romance angle but to be honest it doesnt take up much of the film which is generally covered in blood explosions guts and elvis nods,positive
try to see how many inside connections to the king you can guess,positive
of course its no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind,positive
i also like these types of guy movies a lot and even though the film doesnt bring much originality to the table it does offer a pretty coherent story some nice twists and turns humor and a big ol helping of whoopass coming straight from costner and russells respective boots,positive
probably not a film for everyone but definitely for those who enjoy the guns the charismatic bad guys and a fun if entirely disposable adventure,positive
now see how many elvis songs ive used to pun my way through this phony review below,positive
the elvis songs also recommend this movie,positive
so whether youre lonesome tonight or any other night remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets leave your little sister at home bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse cause this movie aint one to return to the sender,positive
i really beg of you whether youre stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender,positive
and no suspicious minds either folks cause i got stung by this movie i mean it really shook me up and unless youre the devil in disguise himself i think you wont be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either,positive
so dont be cruel dont turn away dont curl up with your latest flame tonite whether she be a hardheaded woman or not and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film,positive
its now or never folks,positive
trust me i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that id seen so far this year is far behind me,positive
joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building,positive
thank you thank,positive
you very much,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive

steven spielbergs second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film,positive
spielberg ever the student on film has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest and most powerful entries,positive
he also managed to cast this eras greatest answer to jimmy stewart tom hanks who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle,positive
for about 160 out of its 170 minutes saving private ryan is flawless,positive
literally,positive
the plot is simple enough,positive
after the epic dday invasion whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular capt john miller hanks and his team are forced to search for a pvt,positive
james ryan damon whose brothers have all died in battle,positive
once they find him they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home,positive
accompanying miller are his crew played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational,positive
barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi davies and burns are the team sent to find one man and bring him home,positive
the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary,positive
literally,positive
there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the films first 20 minutes,positive
spielberg films almost the entire movie without music leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion and they do to perfection,positive
the sequences in france all of them beginning with the battle and ending with the battle are fabulous especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides trying to save private ryan,positive
there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences,positive
this is what coppola was looking for in apocalypse now but couldnt create,positive
the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war,positive
the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary,positive
he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world with his comic timing dramatic flair his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears,positive
hanks is this countrys finest actor and he proves it here,positive
however spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece,positive
with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film,positive
the sequence involving army chiefofstafff george marshall and mrs ryan is decent but doesnt hold up to the rest of the film relying on wartime cliches to power it,positive
but that is forgivable,positive
what isnt is the bookends of the film the cemetary sequences,positive
the first one is quite good a decent introduction into the lives of these men,positive
the last sequence is atrocious,positive
the forced emotion accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film,positive
these flaws are what downgrade ryan from the greatest film of our era to the greatest war film of our era,positive
spielberg should have trusted his own material and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie to end his masterpiece right there,positive
the use of the flag though patriotic is in contrast to the movies theme,positive
the power of the bulk of the film however is astonishing,positive
spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art that persists even after first viewing of the film is extraordinary,positive
this is the film of the year,positive
tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently,positive
the dalai lama has made speaking tours tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months,positive
kundun presence a name the monks call the young dalai lama opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader,positive
a group of monks enters a village and a twoyearold child catches their attention,positive
the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as mine,positive
he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country,positive
he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950,positive
the peaceful and isolated country is illequipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results,positive
eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india,positive
comparisons to seven years in tibet are inevitable,positive
both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerners point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt,positive
kundun features only native actors and is more of an insiders story,positive
in some ways this makes this film a superior concept but it lacks the movement and spark that made seven years such an audiencepleaser,positive
the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie filmed in morocco for obvious reasons,positive
the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computergenerated character,positive
on an intellectual level it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts,positive
some events are depicted differently and pitts austrian mountainclimber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lamas life isnt even mentioned here,positive
glossed over in seven years the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses we were just about to change things after the chinese attack,positive
the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins,positive
his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail,positive
especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain,positive
the visual treats more than make up for the movies faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience,positive
walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience,positive
martin scorsese known for his dark tales of the underworld goodfellas taxi driver casino has shifted gears,positive
something of a thematic followup to his the last temptation of christ this is his slowest film yet,positive
oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese most of these events take place offscreen,positive
his decision to not overexplain rituals is commendable,positive
the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoonfed interpretations,positive
philip glasss score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting,positive
i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again,positive
hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india i was struck by what was missing in the movie,positive
as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is there is a distance between the audience and the movie,positive
the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings,positive
with the exception of a few scenes involvement with the characters is slight,positive
one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama shown as a mischievous boy who cant resist being a kid sometimes,positive
an encounter with his older brother thubten j norbu a retired indiana university professor who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment but there arent many of these,positive
even with its problems the kundun experience is phenomenal but one that i fear most will miss,positive
many people who saw seven years in tibet will have a been there done that attitude,positive
its likely that the film will miss a widespread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping,positive
note there are spoilers regarding the films climax the election of course,positive
we see matthew broderick a man torn to a primal state hes been unfaithful to his wife lied to and manipulated his students and by the same token theyve demeaned his masculinity his selfrespect his desperate attempt at changing the world,positive
and yet he equates the cause of his pain his torment with tracy flick reese witherspoon,positive
no matter how many students have come and gone and disappointed him as an educator shes the real threat,positive
about to give in and divulge that shes won by only a lone vote brodericks mccalister turns in defeat sees tracys euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says no,positive
the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men no matter how obscure have in their relationships a traditional expectation of success to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry,positive
she cant go higher than him,positive
he wont allow it,positive
and whats amazing about election is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor,positive
early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically and then sexually involved with a now departed teacher,positive
its like payne and taylor his coscreenwriter have taken tracy a girl desperate for friendship loyalty and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers that they found sitting at the teachers lunch table more fitting to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist,positive
and its amazing the compassion that we have it seems so real to us and not merely because its happened before splashed all over the front pages but because of the all around nice persona of these people we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters,positive
its with mandy barnetts if youll be the teacher playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most a final viscous injection of bittersweet irony,positive
sexuality though is not the only basis for paynes satire or its success,positive
it also makes a telling point about politics friendship and class boundaries,positive
satire is required or ought to be anyway to take itself seriously or act so while the audience does not,positive
its a fine line to straddle but some films ignore it altogether drop dead gorgeous leaps infuriatingly to mind,positive
payne and taylor hit the right chord their characters are real people neither is perfect but rather both of the leads are flawed misguided individuals who retain somewhat noble intentions at heart,positive
we sympathize with them but still as a satire their idiosyncratic behavior and their wrongdoing is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle but also reflect and meditate about,positive
minus half a point though for payne admitting not to having seen ferris buellers day off,positive
whatever,positive
anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases,positive
especially hercules,positive
emotion,positive
all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences arent going to hold anyones interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together,positive
not since disneys beauty the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works,positive
the story of the romanov family the rulers of russia and their downfall begins the film,positive
anastasia one of the daughters narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin voiced by christopher lloyd with her grandmother voiced by angela landsbury,positive
but anastasia gets lost and grows up with no memory of her royal origins,positive
the grandmother lives in paris hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution,positive
a young woman named anya voiced by meg ryan runs across dimitri john cusack and vlad kelsey grammar who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money,positive
they pick anya to pose as their princes and of course it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia,positive
dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner and meanwhile rasputin is not dead and plots his revenge against the last romanov,positive
the plot is actually quite well structured,positive
there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later but it moves along fast enough that theyll never have time to be bored,positive
what this really means is that the adults wont be bored by it either,positive
there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses,positive
there is of course lots of comedy for the kids including rasputins pet bat bartok hank azaria who is easily the funniest thing in the film,positive
however the comical scenes never distract from the drama but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly,positive
the animation is gorgeous the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators,positive
not since beauty the beast have animated characters had so much life to them,positive
even without the voices they act,positive
the musical number in paris is a showstopper with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style,positive
as with all recent animated features there are songs however these songs do more than just provide fodder for top40 singers to get on the radio although there are three of them during the end credits,positive
the songs are all very catchy and advance the plot instead of just being showpieces except for the paris number but thats so much fun its okay,positive
i cant reccomend anastasia highly enough,positive
its a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics,positive
kids and adults alike will enjoy it and its also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney,positive
dont let the following quirks of this review fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love,positive
but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that,positive
life is beautiful even though im a short ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh,positive
life is beautiful even though i havent amounted to much in life except working out the finer intricacies of waitering,positive
im a lucky sort of a guy especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath life is beautiful,positive
im a jew but life can still be beautiful,positive
the nazis put me in a concentration camp but life is still beautiful,positive
i love my son very much and thats what matters and thats what makes life beautiful,positive
my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful,positive
i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love but hey thats life and thats still a beautiful thing so by jove dont give me any crap about it,positive
by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved,positive
well done there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni,positive
is evil dead ii a bad movie,positive
its full of terrible acting pointless violence and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release,positive
explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots including the original evil dead is extremely difficult,positive
well whats it about,positive
five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly hairy wart covered monsters,positive
come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week,positive
why should i see it again,positive
no evil dead ii is different its funny,positive
its funny to see people die,positive
are you sick or something,positive
maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie,positive
his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle as disturbing as it is hilarious,positive
an example of raimis odd approach a monster formerly protagonist ashs girlfriend of all people is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound,positive
sure its overthetop but it is so overthetop that it is laugh out loud funny just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood staining his face and knocking him back a few feet,positive
the whole movie is like this watch ash get beat up watch ash defeat the monster watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster,positive
the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets the more amusing it becomes,positive
no matter how sick it may sound it is funny to watch bruce ampbells ash get his butt kicked every five minutes,positive
and raimi takes advantage he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend by the body of an old lady even by his own right hand,positive
like the less superior idle hands we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part,positive
but it doesnt end ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family,positive
all of these events thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster like camera movements at first become shocking then inexplicably funny,positive
raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers duck soup then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off,positive
with a running time of less than an hour and a half raimi gets away with the impossible making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares,positive
ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldnt wait to make its sequel,positive
contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagans only novel,positive
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway jodie foster,positive
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico where she is part of the seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence project,positive
her research is quickly killed however by her highly political david drumlin tom skerrit who disdains pure research in favor of science with commercial applications,positive
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s r,positive
hadden john hurt,positive
then with that money just about to finally dry up ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal,positive
in the movies most exciting and believable sequence ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega,positive
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before,positive
further decoding with haddens help reveals another layer to message containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine,positive
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens home world,positive
of course the big question becomes who gets to ride it,positive
right after whos gonna pay for this thing,positive
to boil it down ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith,positive
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform apparently to keep godless science from talking to god or something like that,positive
then hadden reappears with startling news,positive
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest,positive
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dreamlike place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father david morse,positive
when she returns home no one believes her,positive
she was not even gone for one second they say even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours,positive
her story is officially discredited although believed by a large segment of the public who dont even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static,positive
eighteen hours worth of static,positive
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first,positive
ellie arroway is a wellrounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working,positive
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs but thats a tough standard to meet,positive
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures,positive
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally,positive
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble,positive
hadden obviously has affection for ellie but in the end he seems to see her as his creation nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board,positive
even palmer joss matthew mcconaughey ellies love interest takes a paternalistic interest in ellie seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses,positive
the film is technically impressive especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine,positive
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain,positive
the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme the dichotomy between science and religion,positive
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved,positive
the film presents science pretty well until the end so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith,positive
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures,positive
rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank very subtle guys the voice of the religious right,positive
another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine jake busey,positive
the only really fleshedout religious person palmer joss is supposed to be a minister of some sort but his actual faith is left pretty vague,positive
i cant even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian,positive
all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about premarital sex,positive
the film drops the science ball at the very end when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith,positive
in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist religious doctrine this is exactly the wrong message to send,positive
in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism,positive
what ellie should have said was you shouldnt believe me,positive
not without evidence and i dont have the evidence,positive
i know what happened but you shouldnt take my word alone,positive
that is the voice of science speaking,positive
the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film,positive
his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position,positive
also his profession of faith before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it,positive
the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles,positive
the media figures such as bernard shaw and jay leno arent so bad in as much as their participation was voluntary,positive
the use of bill clinton however should give anyone pause,positive
first of all lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken is just plain creepy,positive
also using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 forever dating it,positive
people watching this film in the future will say hey this never took place during clintons term,positive
this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief,positive
also the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century,positive
better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all,positive
the film does raise an interesting question although it never develops it in a satisfying way,positive
if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god or at least some form of supernatural creator,positive
personally i would hope not since religion is basically an opinion a form of ideology,positive
i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task,positive
six days seven nights is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare,positive
heres a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows its fluff recognizes its fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff,positive
of course the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movies success ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that its easy to forget what a funny guy he can be,positive
as his female counterpart anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet goofily charismatic performance,positive
the age difference fords 56 heches 29 matters not these two click in a charged way thats hard to come by,positive
the story is a nobrainer ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris while heche is careerminded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe,positive
robin on a tropical vacation with fianc frank david schwimmer gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there,positive
the plane crashes during a terrible storm and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization,positive
a series of unpleasant often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other,positive
meanwhile back at the resort frank is tempted himself by quinns shapely female tagalong jacqueline obradors,positive
that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinnrobin pairing and while it makes for a few good laughs early on it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin,positive
and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways this flaw is only a minor inconvenience,positive
director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk,positive
at a slim 101 minutes six days seven nights never wears out its welcome where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title,positive
michael brownings clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable oneliners my favorite taken in context is you mean arrrgh pirates and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another theyre all quite engaging,positive
even the movies more serious moments are played with a wink,positive
heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the believability of six days seven nights heterosexual pairing,positive
so shes a lesbian,positive
so what,positive
deal with it,positive
of course it doesnt and here her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way,positive
in fact her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click these opposites attract with the utmost endearing electricity,positive
at one point when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest heche asks ford how old he is,positive
after several wrong guesses fortyfive,positive
fifty he whispers his age to her,positive
you still look good heche stammers,positive
i still am good ford replies,positive
shes good too and together they make six days seven nights one memorable ride,positive
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the xfiles,positive
first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie,positive
the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable,positive
you have to reach for a larger audience,positive
therefore the movie is quite userfriendly,positive
altough nonfans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange,positive
but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on,positive
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera,positive
in any case the answer is no,positive
i am not a fan of the xfiles i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium,positive
however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie,positive
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new,positive
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others,positive
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie,positive
warning major spoilers follow,positive
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about,positive
you have been warned,positive
the xfiles is what a summer should be,positive
exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances,positive
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank,positive
from start to finish this movie does not let go of you,positive
when i compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from and the deadly use of sound from event horizon,positive
this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes,positive
in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue,positive
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd,positive
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid,positive
you know when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt,positive
so yeah the xfiles is scary,positive
and guess what,positive
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster,positive
do not think that the xfiles is a monster movie,positive
in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total,positive
no the xfiles is definately a mulder episode of the series,positive
scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time,positive
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much,positive
no this is mulders time in the spotlight,positive
by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day,positive
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead,positive
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who,positive
cares,positive
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about,positive
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous,positive
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill,positive
the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose,positive
if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i cannot stress this enough pay attention,positive
unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects,positive
miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense,positive
also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies dont,positive
the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation,positive
there is no time to take a breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody,positive
the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves a purpose,positive
who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attacks,positive
so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies id recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose,positive
but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the xfiles is,positive
what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited,positive
cool effects,positive
its got some,positive
pulse pounding,positive
hell yes,positive
strangely enough i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have a good time,positive
it does not provide answers to the shows many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together,positive
rating four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah i never saw that one coming,positive
moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending,positive
you may wonder where this movie lost half a star,positive
well i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop,positive
its pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving,positive
seen august 8 1998 at 6 p m at rotterdam square cinemas rotterdam ny theater 6 by myself for free using my critics pass,positive
theater rating good seats sound and picture,positive
war is a topic that cant help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media,positive
movies documentaries and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on such as strategy politics and victory,positive
its easy to forget war in its most basic form is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other,positive
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier no matter what his rank or importance is a real fleshandblood person and not just a number,positive
saving private ryan is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect especially in its unapologetic realistic delivery,positive
it proves theres a huge difference between battling and killing,positive
the film opens with one of the most graphic disturbing scenes in recent memory,positive
its world war ii dday to be exact and the u s military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them,positive
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality,positive
instead of positioned cameras the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared,positive
there is no sense of stability but of constant anxious and confusing motion giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle and just a vulnerable as the poor troops,positive
poor is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are,positive
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters,positive
we dont get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding,positive
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated but as people that must be destroyed because theyre there,positive
in the movies the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch but in reality that wouldnt happen,positive
the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies,positive
they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the wellsecured germans who can actually see who what and where theyre shooting unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off,positive
perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are but that seems to be part of the theme,positive
the film seems to rely on the audiences sense of patriotism that the american military is right and good and that the nazis are inherently evil,positive
the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold a whole 50foot progression and begin to inflict some damage,positive
i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up i couldnt help but feel some sense of joy and relief,positive
to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure but theres nothing cliche about the graphic detailed atmosphere here because it really happened,positive
one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting,positive
the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet,positive
tom hanks stars as captain miller a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon,positive
hes never obsessive or any such generic cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this,positive
he doesnt want to be there any more than his men but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out,positive
the mission the film is concerned with is as the title states saving private ryan,positive
through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker it is brought to a generals attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of eachs death simultaneously,positive
when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother,positive
its easy to sympathize with this situation after all no one should have to lose all their children at once,positive
but finding one man in this war is as miller puts it like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles,positive
the saving of private ryan isnt just a dramatic device but a thematic one,positive
his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country the world even was trying to convince itself it still had,positive
when millers company hears of the mission they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead but miller isnt so quick to shrug it off,positive
he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope and now he has the opportunity to make someones sense of hope a reality,positive
the mission to find ryan gives millers group a destination but not direction,positive
along the way many things happen to them both good and bad,positive
a few battles are fought not to be major accomplishments for the war but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice,positive
the act of killing itself becomes one of the films major philosophical metaphors,positive
the soldiers dont mind killing other soldiers in blind battle but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses,positive
unfortunately death is a fact of war and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters but here spielberg doesnt want us to think these men are invincible,positive
in fact only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man and the performances are good enough to make this method work,positive
although the characters are somewhat typical the actors maintain control over the material at all time,positive
whether theyre arguing with each other telling stories of back home or fighting the germans they never go overboard and always seem believable,positive
sure theres a zinger here and there but war doesnt change the fact boys will be boys,positive
if and when one dies we too can feel the loss even though we hardly knew them,positive
the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous violent battle sequence,positive
private ryan has been found but facing four to one odds can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive,positive
thats not a premise for thrills its symbolic of everything the film has worked for,positive
it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending it ends the way it must end,positive
i remember reading a calvin hobbes comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like dad how do armies of men killing each other solve problems,positive
saving private ryan is the adult version of that question,positive
it was easy to fear the worst,positive
begin with a classic 1960s television series add a big budget and an alist star in the lead role and stir,positive
script you ask,positive
who needs one kid,positive
weve got ourselves a formula,positive
that was my fear a bloated monster without any sense of direction,positive
then much to my amazement everything that could possibly go wrong,positive
didnt,positive
the fugitive is as lean taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years,positive
under the direction of andrew davis 1992s under siege the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go,positive
expect box office to go through the roof deservedly and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones,positive
the premise is a simple one,positive
dr richard kimble harrison ford is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer a man with an artificial arm,positive
after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry kimble finds himself on the run,positive
his one goal to find the onearmed man andreas katsulas before u s marshall sam gerard tommy lee jones finds him,positive
where the fugitive surprises the most is the script by jeb stuart and david twohy,positive
in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence its attention to detail and its respect for the audience,positive
in an early sequence kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard slick back his hair and change into a lab coat,positive
on his way out a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesnt know is kimble to zip up his pants,positive
its a small moment but it punches home the urgency of kimbles situation and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget,positive
later while trying to lose himself in a parade kimble thinks to drop his overcoat the most likely way hed be recognized from behind,positive
its these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimbles tells gerard that hes too smart to be caught he may just be right,positive
credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators,positive
the bus crash which allows kimbles escape is a spectacular sequence as is a leap from a dam into the water below,positive
the action is crisp and brutal and never romanticized,positive
special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the singlemindedness of the two leads,positive
and what a pair of performances those leads are,positive
tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard because he manages an incredibly challenging feat,positive
for the first third of the film there is really no villain per se kimble is on the run and gerard is out to find him,positive
it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent vindictive inspector javert but that never happens,positive
instead jones plays him as a sharp committed man whos just doing his job so that when he responds to kimbles comment i didnt kill my wife with a matteroffact i dont care we know exactly what he means,positive
its not his job to determine guilt or innocence,positive
its his job to bring in a fugitive,positive
this is a well written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form,positive
the only unfortunate thing about jones stunning turn is that its likely to overshadow harrison ford and thats a shame,positive
for his entire career ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero,positive
however he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence,positive
the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing and ford is up to the task,positive
this summer has been loaded with films and most of them have been doing brisk business,positive
however its time for clint sean and various dinosaurs to step aside,positive
the chase is on,positive
my advice is to catch it,positive
richard gere can be a commanding actor but hes not always in great films,positive
everything comes together here,positive
gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity,positive
it doesnt go exactly as he expects,positive
geres client aaron edward norton is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop,positive
the evidence is stacked against him,positive
he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishops blood,positive
his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene,positive
he has a relationship with the priest,positive
gere talks to the boy believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer,positive
despite the lawyers proclamations that he doesnt care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with peoples lives he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him,positive
lots of complications and twists,positive
the prosecuting attorney is geres former coworker and lover,positive
they both work each others motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy,positive
her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections,positive
aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on,positive
geres case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas,positive
gere is exceptional as the welldressed reserved counselor but just once i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his suit persona,positive
even when he loses it you dont see very far inside,positive
nortons aaron is convincing he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city,positive
the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story,positive
as with most of the effective courtroom dramas the cinematography is crisp and rich,positive
the story will keep you on the edge of your seat,positive
nothing is what it seems,positive
in essence good will hunting is an ordinary story told well,positive
taken as a whole theres little thats special about this tale it follows a traditional narrative path leaves the audience with a warm fuzzy feeling and never really challenges or surprises us,positive
but its intelligently written with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant strongly directed and nicely acted,positive
so while good will hunting is far from a lateyear masterpiece its a worthwhile sample of entertainment,positive
like scent of a woman which was released around this time of the season five years ago good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a worldweary veteran and a cocky young man,positive
the formula for the two films is similar both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it but the characters are different,positive
al pacinos slade was a largerthanlife individual robin williams sean mcguire is much more subtle,positive
and matt damons will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris odonnells charlie,positive
will is a troubled individual,positive
as a child he was the frequent victim of abuse,positive
an orphan he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis,positive
now not yet 21 years old he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet,positive
he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box,positive
but hes a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems,positive
while working as a janitor at mit he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math buildings hall blackboards,positive
then one evening his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau stellan skarsgard catches him at work,positive
will flees but lambeau tracks him down,positive
unfortunately by the time the professor finds him will is in jail for assaulting a police offer,positive
the judge agrees to release will under two conditions that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist,positive
eventually once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man sean mcguire a teacher at bunker hill community college agrees to take the case,positive
after a rocky start the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor,positive
and as will advances his selfawareness in sessions with sean he also learns about friendship from his buddy chuckie ben affleck and love from a harvard coed named skylar minnie driver,positive
the script by costars matt damon and ben affleck is not a groundbreaking piece of literature and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation,positive
the characters are welldeveloped however and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles,positive
at one point will comments that a session with sean is turning into a tasters choice moment,positive
later will gives a brilliant breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith,positive
note since smith coexecutive produced good will hunting its not out of the question that he had some input into this scene,positive
director gus van sant drugstore cowboy to die for culls genuine emotion from his actors and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes,positive
theres an edginess to some of the therapy sessions and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver who became romantically linked while making this film translates effectively to the movie the relationship is electric,positive
likewise the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckies friendship,positive
many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation even if the overall story is somewhat generic,positive
matt damon who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker is solid although not spectacular as will,positive
minnie driver last seen in grosse pointe blank adds another strong performance to a growing resume and its refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one,positive
the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams whose sean is sad and wise funny and somber,positive
arguably the best dramatic work in the actors career alongside what he did in the fisher king williams portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination,positive
adequate support is provided by ben affleck chasing amy and stellan skarsgard breaking the waves,positive
like most of what comes before it the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable,positive
but meeting expectations and following a familiar path arent always bad things in a movie provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail,positive
good will hunting does both and as a result earns a rating commensurate with the good in the title,positive
this three hour movie opens up with a view of composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members,positive
all the rest displays a compilation of footage mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city halloween 1979,positive
other footage shows backstage foolishness and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford,positive
the performance of titties and beer played in this movie is very entertaining with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil,positive
franks guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix ive ever heard,positive
bruce bickfords outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms morphings etc and actually it doesnt even look like clay it looks like meat,positive
to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie mulan is a whole new world,positive
the mouse factorys latest feature is a treasure featuring magnificent animation a strong story and finely drawn characters,positive
mulan is the story of a fiesty headstrong young woman who unlike other disney heroines isnt seeking her prince charming,positive
mulans motivations are simple to save her father serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say,positive
the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation,positive
the emperor has called for a conscription one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation,positive
mulans crippled father is called but mulan sneaks off steals his armor and takes his place,positive
mulan is a saga of courage and selfdiscovery,positive
yet despite the grim backdrop of war it is a lively tale of selfreliance and brainoverbrawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy,positive
the movie utilizes a strong corps of asianamerican talent as the voices for the main characters including the wonderful mingna wen the joy luck club as mulan b d,positive
wong as shang mulans commanding officer and later love interest pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soontek oh as mulans proud but loving father,positive
also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon sent by mulans ancestors to watch over and help the young woman,positive
his fast wisecracking hiptalking mushu may seem out of place but its a crowd pleasing performance especially for the youngsters,positive
the movie features only a couple of songs fewer than most previous disney animated flicks but mulans are winners,positive
the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot,positive
the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus,positive
mulan is a treat more powerful than hercules with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame,positive
at about 85 minutes mulan moves rapidly and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end,positive
mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain,positive
also it is hoped that the success of mulan and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asianamerican themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production,positive
it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them,positive
committed to lifelong learning through effective communication,positive
the submarine genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is,positive
think about it,positive
these films are completely based in reality yet only a handful of people have ever been on one making them fascinating to the general public,positive
they arent like movies that take place on a plane or a train as anybody can get on one of those,positive
and they arent like movies that happen in outer space either because no ones done any of that stuff yet,positive
when a new one comes out you dont hear anyone say ugh another submarine movie like people tend to say ugh another boxing movie,positive
look at modern movies that involve submarines das boot the abyss the hunt for red october crimson tide,positive
all are well regarded as topnotch entertainment,positive
gladly joining that bunch is u571 which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u s naval submarine during world war ii,positive
we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior bill paxton,positive
mcconaugheys crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence,positive
the mission goes horribly wrong however and as a result mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew as well as a captured german become trapped aboard the u571 in enemy waters,positive
the first great thing about u571 is the films opening sequence,positive
the german crew of u571 are under attack which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion,positive
its tense exciting and fascinating,positive
and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles,positive
most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away,positive
once the plot gets moving u571 gives us action sequence after action sequence making the audience wonder ok now how do they get out of this,positive
the stakes keep raising much like in executive decision an excellent actionthriller and even though the audience knows how the film will end its a lot of fun getting there,positive
i only have two minor complaints about the entire film,positive
the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence,positive
while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going which they do i feel as though it could have been done much quicker and less conventionally,positive
i mean did we really have to see the ships crew at a wedding,positive
because of that you now know exactly whats going to happen to the groom,positive
my other gripe would be during the films finale,positive
theres an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the presidents plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one,positive
i cannot stress this enough,positive
until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect stick with using models,positive
yes u571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you that couldnt happen but the overall point of this film is entertainment,positive
it succeeds fantastically,positive
pg13,positive
finding the courage to face life fullon is a difficult task,positive
summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job,positive
if youre a total jerk like melvin udall is the odds are even more against you,positive
melvin jack nicholson is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be,positive
a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship he avoids the outside world as much as possible,positive
his obsessivecompulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk,positive
theres a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles verysmall mosaic tiles,positive
melvin has some great lines,positive
when his publishers receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books he responds i think of men and i take away reason and accountability,positive
dont get him wrong hes not merely a misogynist,positive
setting his sights higher than that hes also a homophobe racist antisemite xenophobe animalhater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors,positive
when we first meet him hes busy dumping a neighbors dog down the garbage chute,positive
hes an equal opportunity bigot,positive
he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe,positive
melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly helen hunt is the only one willing to wait on him,positive
and shes none too happy about it,positive
when carol doesnt show up for work melvins routine is shot and hes determined to do something about it,positive
tracking down her address he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast,positive
the fact that shes a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesnt appear to phase him he wants his food,positive
much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop greg kinnear is brutally attacked during a robbery,positive
this doesnt upset melvin much dont worry youll be back on your knees in no time but when he is bullied into taking care of simons dog his life is turned topsyturvey,positive
melvin is sequestered because hes afraid of whats out there on the other side of his apartment door,positive
he has to make sure its ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side,positive
when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes,positive
this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up,positive
hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him he pays for a specialist to treat her son,positive
he even develops a friendship with simon,positive
all three people are heavily damaged,positive
melvin has retreated from life in his apartment,positive
carol has devoted herself to her son convinced that she has to give up her life for him,positive
simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out,positive
a more unlikely trio to form relationships youd rarely see,positive
and in the midst of it all there are some wonderful moments,positive
melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice,positive
you make me want to be a better man he tells her,positive
one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up he is still a curmudgeon,positive
carol afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him,positive
it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet tshirt contest,positive
theres hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson,positive
i dont remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his overtheedge melvin is no disappointment,positive
nicholson may be the best actor working today,positive
hunt does a commendable job matching nicholsons energy,positive
she isnt afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted rundown carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is topnotch,positive
their onscreen chemistry is a bit odd,positive
each does a wonderful job with the character but together theres something a little off,positive
its a minor problem they do work well together but that missing element is what prevents this from being a fourstar film,positive
director james l brooks terms of endearment broadcast news has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful nominees for all the top golden globes winners from the national board of review inevitable oscars and has a winner on his hands,positive
as good as it gets isnt exactly the quality that the title says but its pretty darn close,positive
michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and as soon as he finishes this one hes off to an annual 12 night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm,positive

that wacky el nino,positive
sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist,positive
by fernando vallejo,positive
starring bob flanagan and sheree rose,positive
interviews by kathe burkhart kirby dick and rita valencia,positive
produced and directed by kirby dick,positive
running time 90 mins,positive
this film is not rated,positive
the central themes of sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist are pain and love and its subsequent effect on a persons life,positive
its protagonist bob flanagan who died at the age of 52 suffered from cystic fibrosis a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus preventing him from normal breathing,positive
the movie is about much more than recouperating or attempting to from this disease,positive
an audacious fabulously triumphant docudrama sick chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years sheree rose who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film,positive
flanagans idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental similar to terry zwigoffs brilliant 1994 crumb which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait but a realistic one,positive
both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects,positive
but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age courageously defying god he was an irish catholic and turning his body into a work of art which he unraveled in museums and lectures,positive
behold these works of physical art,positive
among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus and the most disturbing scene of the decade nailing his penis to a board,positive
flanagan was a man of great intelligence wit and humor as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking,positive
not only did he approach his disease with humor peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience he was also revitalized by his approachment,positive
most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties theres also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her,positive
but the most outstanding thing about sick is flanagans relationship with sheree,positive
brimming with honesty sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain their powerful bond lifts sick into a rare cinematic high where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people,positive
the last scene where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed as he struggles for his last moments of life is raw tender hideous,positive
it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy,positive
i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didnt need a sequel,positive
beloved by kids and their parents respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs that first movie remains a landmark of recent history the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzledazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting,positive
if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply it didnt show and as distributor and partowner of the property at least it had a piece of the action,positive
toy story 2 was greenlighted as a directtovideo project disneys standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film,positive
as someone who doesnt believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing granted they usually are a bad thing but thats because theyre made for the wrong reasons i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking,positive
fortunately disney claimed to have been so knockedout by early animation tests that they let pixar go fullspeed ahead with a theatrical sequel,positive
lucky thing too like the first movie this one is a joy to behold on the big screen and technically it improves on its predecessor on just about every level,positive
from a business standpoint the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar while the previous films elements are shared between pixar and disney a sign of the production houses new cachet in hollywood,positive
visually the main shortcoming of this fully computergenerated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly making them look a little creepy,positive
fortunately that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie where the secret world of toys is more immediate and arguably more attractive than the world of the humans who surround them,positive
as before the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy and indeed all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children come to life in the childs absence,positive
while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves the real joy of a toys life is to mean something to its owner,positive
one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned left on a shelf to gather dust and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors,positive
most often those toys are packed away in dark spaces safe from sunlight and humidity and often theyre not even removed from their packaging,positive
imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder and youll understand the attitudes of the collectors items that show up in this movie,positive
sheriff woody voiced by a noteperfect tom hanks the longtime favorite among andys toys who was challenged in the previous goround by the arrival of flashynewthing action figure buzz lightyear tim allen suffers an injury early in the film when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart revealing the stuffing inside,positive
this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence,positive
those anxieties are crystallized when andys mom tears through his living room collecting old toys for a yard sale,positive
and theres an ironic twist to the tale as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum,positive
the rest of andys toys who owe him quite a debt resolve to rescue him,positive
that this film manages to turn a box marked 25 cents into a symbol of doom or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma is a testament to its skill at metaphor seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys,positive
operating on this level of abstraction toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness,positive
the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark,positive
sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard,positive
theres somewhat less of the seatofthepants loopiness that energized the first film allowing it to surprise and excite on a nearconstant basis and more philosophizing about toys collectors the nature of happiness and the meaning of life,positive
while that leads to fewer bellylaughs it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion,positive
just dont ask why andys favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957,positive
where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at als toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers buzz lightyear action figures,positive
forget the selfcongratulatory science fiction of the matrix this is a fundamental mindbender for buzz and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight,positive
here as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish childrens tv show that originated his character we see our protagonists come facetoface with god,positive
in sly ways then toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality a metaphorical consideration of aging and death,positive
significantly the films very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our openingnight crowd in a nearuproar,positive
and toward the end when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys one of them observes with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking that it will be fun while it lasts,positive
so toy story 2 joins the tradition of childrens stories largely neglected of late that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence,positive
whats really striking is that both toy story films and to a lesser degree pixars a bugs life are kids movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts not to mention whatever piece of totfriendly eyecandy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer,positive
it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros animation,positive
im not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention they love traditional narrative too much but boy it makes me wonder what they might come up with next,positive
directed by john lasseter colin brady ash brannon and lee unkrich written by lasseter brannon peter docter andrew stanton rita hsaio doug chamberlain and chris webb cinematography by sharon calahan starring voices tom hanks tim allen and joan cusack usa 1999,positive
theatrical aspect ratio 1 85 1,positive
being john malkovich is the type of film we need to see more,positive
todays films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas or those that have similar themes,positive
malkovich falls under none of these categories and its quite refreshing to see that occur,positive
this strangely provoking story is actually somewhat understandable,positive
john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time,positive
his wife cameron diaz supports the both of them by working at a petstore which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment,positive
when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job he finds an ad for a filing clerk,positive
when he reaches the building he arrives at a 7 12 floor,positive
its there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time,positive
meanwhile cusack meets a business partner catherine keener in which he falls madly in love with her,positive
the only problem is she has no interest in him what so ever,positive
the whole portal thing isnt just a toy in fact it becomes cusacks dream,positive
being inside malkovichs mind gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich like a puppet and to fulfill his fantasies,positive
i dont want to give away too much but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery,positive
in my opinion this idea is absolutely brilliant,positive
its really quite scary to think that someone could become you control you be you,positive
it makes you wonder why we act like we do and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue,positive
even if the script is super sharp i cant help but find the ending displeasing,positive
it could have lead up to something more or at least an amusing conclusion,positive
it tried to explain a mythology about the portals that made it seem rushed,positive
other than that i had a very enjoyable time,positive
the acting was quite delightful as well,positive
john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability and he does it well,positive
hes by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity but im hoping that will change,positive
cameron diaz was her usual charming self although i felt that part was wrong for her but she pulled it off,positive
john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice,positive
who elses mind would be better to explore,positive
the director spike jonze who appeared in last months three kings really catches my attention with this project,positive
i knew he was bizzare but not to this extreme,positive
he too is likely too receive media attention,positive
being john malkovich isnt an excellent film but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite,positive
whats even better is the films puzzling message am,positive
i nick lyons,positive
the blair witch project was perhaps one of a kind a unique film that played completely on its own merit managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses,positive
its success made a sequel inevitable but this is not the sequel i suspect anyone much wanted,positive
after the release of the blair witch project tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch,positive
locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity selling twigsculptures stones and dirt like those in the movie and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn shouting get out of these woods and go home,positive
there is no goddamned blair witch,positive
jeff is one of those people who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage,positive
after he got released from the mental institution he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet,positive
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods on the blair witch hunt,positive
among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend the pregnant tristen who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called the blair witch history or hysteria and kim who dresses in black and has some psychic powers,positive
the last member of the crew is erica a young beautiful witchwannabe who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore saying the first rule of wicca is do no harm because whatever you do will come back to you threefold,positive
this strange group plunges into the woods where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience,positive
on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parrs abandoned house strange things start happening,positive
when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain,positive
after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies,positive
they are somehow lost in time as it loops uncontrollably back and forth,positive
they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality,positive
the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods,positive
documentary director joe berlinger paradice lost helms blair witch 2 leaving the creators of the first film dan myrick and ed sanches in the background,positive
the opening scenesthe documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film is a more promising approach because instead of trying to cover similar ground it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand,positive
but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue,positive
in a way this is a typical hollywood sequel,positive
more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail,positive
the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated,positive
of course in these situations quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values,positive
from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloodyred forest with carter burwells being john malkovich and fargo musical score in the background you realize that with the exception of its title this film has absolutely nothing to do with the blair witch project,positive
blair witch,positive
was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation,positive
in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection creating a completely different atmosphere,positive
with its graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the film has a very polished look which is impossible to associate with the first installment,positive
and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor,positive
the key is simplicity,positive
blair witch project had a story which was incredibly simple,positive
that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination,positive
the film was practically an empty screen on which we projected our most frightening nightmares,positive
the effect was incredibly powerful lasting and entir e everyone but in a different way,positive
book of shadows feels incredibly controlled and restrict,positive
here very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and clever that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it,positive
there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with,positive
this is simply a less artistic film that doesnt have the talent and originality of its predecessor,positive
it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesnt always succeed,positive
but most importantly it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie which doesnt allow it to destroy the original,positive
in the end i cant call it a bad effort,positive
its less artistic not so scary and less original but certainly not bad,positive
its simply different,positive
in fact if you havent seen the blair witch project you might like this film for what it is a cross between the blair witch project and the scream films,positive
the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned and incredible sense of surrealism,positive
but its a common knowledge and experience that with a few exceptions every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making,positive
to me the story of the blair witch project seemed completed but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that the book of shadows is certainly assured,positive
and its already time to look forward to blair witch 3,positive
martin scorseses kundun which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure,positive
personally i dont think it needs one it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china,positive
scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do as a largerthanlife symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal,positive
the set design and cinematography are outstanding and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao,positive
political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans kundun does not it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative,positive
the full monty is a whole lot of fun its wacky witty and original,positive
its written and directed by relatively unknowns simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo who both turned up oscar nominations,positive
how did this movie with a budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide,positive
its been rumored that this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year,positive
and to think its about male exotic dancers and not sinking ships,positive
six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs,positive
inspired by the success of a chippendales production gaz robert carlyle decides they should all put on a strip show to make some money quickly,positive
as the six team up to put on the show of their lives they run into a few problems,positive
for instance dave mark addy is worried about his weight horse paul barber thinks he may be inadequate and gerald tom wilkinson is worried about his reputation and timing,positive
so when the night of the show comes will the men be able to do the full monty,positive
as i said before this is a fun movie and not just that its really artistically good,positive
the writing and direction are great,positive
the acting is appealing all the performances have a human quality to them so you can relate to at least one of the characters,positive
the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture,positive
which left me wondering one thing why didnt trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year,positive
while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy it doesnt carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting,positive
still the full monty is a great film a must see,positive
because the press screening of planet of the apes was one day past last issues deadline i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece,positive
the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance that the story was thin that mark wahlbergs character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked,positive
to those people i would like to say what the hell did you expect,positive
this is a tim burton movie boys and girls,positive
tim burton movies have great art direction and thin clunky stories,positive
for the blissfully nasty disjointed and underrated mars attacks,positive
jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie burton reportedly tossed vintage mars attacks,positive
trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up,positive
burtons reimagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great,positive
the apes courtesy of makeup magician rick baker are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold,positive
like astronaut leo davidson wahlberg the film hits the ground running whisking viewers through a headspinning series of solid oneliners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later,positive
as for wahlberg consider what burton does with his character,positive
from his start as a filmmaker burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits peewee herman the joker ed wood the ackacking martians etc and lack of interest in standard issue heroes,positive
so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders,positive
as for lack of color remember leo only launches into space to get his monkey back,positive
he doesnt want to lead humanity and he isnt looking for romance from a pretty but dull human estella warren or a dynamic ape helena bonham carter terrific as an equalrights activist,positive
as a man who just wants out wahlberg is focused subtle and sly,positive
the surprise ending provides the requisite shock and some more dandy visuals particularly of the approaching authority figures but admittedly isnt nearly as satisfying as the one in the original,positive
for the original ending to work we only had to make one simple connection for this one we have to write a whole new screenplay,positive
the 1968 apes boasted a handful of great scenes cool looking monkeys a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed redelivering a classic line and a killer ending,positive
but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball,positive
the 2001 planet of the apes offers a different set of great scenes much cooler looking monkeys fine acting from wahlberg bonham carter paul giamatti and tim roth and a not so good ending,positive
it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and thats nothing to complain about,positive
this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960s under the same appellation,positive
mind you most people including yours truly who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series,positive
the movie is really a stand alone in that regard,positive
the family robinson lost in space,positive
plot set in the year 2058 the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future,positive
a colonization process if you will,positive
they are joined by able pilot west leblanc and evil uninvited stowaway oldman who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip,positive
eventually their trek goes awry and all are lost in space,positive
how do get back to earth,positive
is the question that infests the rest of this scifi epic,positive
critique this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element 6 510 from the summer of 1997,positive
its a film with a lot of flash but very little actual substance,positive
admittedly there isnt an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film but this film does run a little too long and did lose me in regards to its complex timetravel multidimensional story line,positive
having said that the special effects in this movie were amazing and the overall look and feel were also way above average,positive
you really felt like you were in the future and riding through space with these poor souls,positive
unfortunately for this chosen family their 10year old son is the smartest one in the group and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ever heard that one before,positive
yawn,positive
the acting is ok and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friends matt leblanc who shows us all that hes definitely more than just a pretty face,positive
on the down side the family riffraff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and timeconsuming even though we gotta give them credit for trying to develop characters in a scifi pic the story line is hard to follow the evil character in the movie actually tells people that hes evil and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long,positive
on the slick side many of the special effects are really cool the sequence in which the family is paralyzed during the hyperdrive is awesome and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling i will also admit that somehow they got me to semitear up near the conclusion of this picture very,positive
odd,positive
overall if youre a big scifi fan check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative and if youre not i would still suggest seeing this movie but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts,positive
little known facts this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic 710 out of the top spot at the boxoffice after 15 straight weeks at number one,positive
garry oldman is british and was once married to uma thurman for about six months,positive
mimi rogers was tom cruises first wife,positive
synopsis private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband,positive
after uncovering the authenticity of the film welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers,positive
comments 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time,positive
though it doesnt present a snuff film a movie which documents a persons murder for real usually during or after some form of sexual act as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as say natural born killers 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it,positive
it is not fun to watch see something else if you get upset by realistic sadistic violence,positive
this films violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc17 territory,positive
for those with strong stomachs however 8 mm is an intelligent worthwhile thriller especially during its second hour,positive
nicolas cage after a couple hohum movies returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities,positive
as tom welles a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newlyborn daughter cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants,positive
serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix who plays a struggling songwriter named max california,positive
california despite his name is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character,positive
the real star of the movie though must be peter stormare,positive
stormare played the really really evil guy in fargo and his character dino velvet in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable,positive
his performance is very chilling,positive
8 mms success may hardly be surprising,positive
it was directed by joel schumacher who hopefully saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin,positive
before directing the last two batman duds however schumacher was responsible for several wellmade horror flicks lost boys flatliners and falling down,positive
8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who selfdestructs before the audiences eyes,positive
8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker who also penned the academy awardwinning thriller seven a few years back,positive
like seven 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater,positive
welles is searching for answers,positive
how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly methodically sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film,positive
when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end the murderer responds that there are no reasons,positive
he just enjoys it,positive
that walker seems to suggest is where the real terror lays not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist,positive
a couple minor faults led me to my fourstar rating five stars is the highest rating i give,positive
one i found it a little difficult early on to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film,positive
yes snuff is a horrible thing but a detective of welles caliber has probably encountered awful things before,positive
second some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient,positive
he discovers for example the victims diary in her private bathroom despite the fact the the police the fbi and her own mother have all investigated the room before,positive
finally the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film,positive
despite the above criticisms 8 mm is an engrossing story,positive
one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles who no longer seems like a hero brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film,positive
he pulls a gun on the man and for a relatively long amount of time struggles to decide whether or not to kill him,positive
he then leaves the building and calls the victims mother in the middle of the night to basically see if she would support the action,positive
the entire scene is tense unpredictable and emotionally charged,positive
rarely anymore do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm with scenes like this did,positive
8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart,positive
this is a graphic oftentimes unflinching look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people,positive
if youre prepared for a film of this nature i give it an enthusiastic recommendation,positive
a bugs life may not be toy story but its more close than antz was,positive
i really liked antz basically because yes it is clever and witty and intelligent and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead perhaps the years most inspired casting but there was in fact something missing from it and im the first to admit that,positive
maybe its that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun its too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging and if it werent for woody allen it would have been just a really clever goodnotgreat flick,positive
a bugs life has a similar premise and it also has disney to insure that its grated and not totally over kids heads like antz was not a bad thing believe me but what it also has is a tone thats completely innocent even when its also remaining perpetually clever,positive
antz is still the more witty film and i love it for it and a bugs life is more for general consumption but its also more entertaining,positive
it broadens its horizons and when it really moves from the ant colony it really shows us a whole new world weve never seen before and its take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in antz,positive
its also light and clever,positive
the visuals are instead of earth tones bright worldly colors and still gives the amazing visual technology of antz at least a worthy contender,positive
the characters are also nicely realized though watereddown for broad consumption they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films,positive
the lead character flik voiced by dave foley is nothing more than a slightlyless neurotic z from antz but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z instead of gene hackman playing the villain we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper the nicelytitled hopper,positive
and for the romantic lead we dont get spacey sharon stone but intelligent and hardtoget julialouis dreyfuss who doesnt even come around until the very final frames,positive
not that the plots really any better than the one in antz its basically yet another redux of the seven samurai with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else,positive
when flik a bone fide inventor creates a timeconserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the seasons donation he puts them all in risk and is sent away so that he wont screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers,positive
he runs into a group of warrirors who are unbeknownst to him a group of carnival bugs and they agree to help under similar false pretenses,positive
these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in toy story foppish walking stick slim david hydepierce german caterpillar heimlich joe ranft quicktempered and insecure male ladybug francis denis leary pretentious praying mantis manny jonathan harris his assistant butterfly hypsy madeliene kahn spider rosie bonnie hunt and two fleas tuck and roll michael mcshane who speak in undiscernable jibberish,positive
the writers lightly touch on each bugs place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats,positive
grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake,positive
a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat whose usual mildmannered squeal is a scream of death,positive
the bug city is a modernday metropolis complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb holding out a cup with a sign lying next to him that says kid tore off wings,positive
and a rainstorm is like a giant flood with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour,positive
around this the pixar animators stage several large set pieces like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket,positive
meanwhile each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting something antz couldnt do and by the end over the end credits a bugs life pulls its final punch out clevering antz with a series of incessantly hilarious fauxbloopers that come just at the right time when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full moneys worth of entertainment,positive
still its no toy story,positive
that film maybe above any animated film ive ever seen encompassed almost true perfection in story character and wit,positive
it proved that it didnt need to brag about its cutting edge technology to really soar its the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far but is still the most satisfying and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun,positive
yet a bugs life as well as antz are still amazing films and prove without doubt that if youre gonna make a computer animated film send it to the guys who created these three flicks evne if theyre not working under the same roof,positive
elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid1500s,positive
it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings,positive
internally the catholics wage war against the protestants,positive
meanwhile spain scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power,positive
little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth cate blanchett will be their greatest hope for survival,positive
the film charts elizabeths tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom,positive
as a protestant she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen,positive
but her halfsister queen mary kathy burke deathly ill and unable to conceive a child pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne,positive
mary gives her her blessing on only one condition that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land,positive
once declared queen elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault both by her own subjects including the duke of norfolk played with steelyeyed grace by christopher eccleston and by forces abroad,positive
slowly but surely the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom,positive
elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers,positive
her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham geoffrey rush in a perfectly subtle performance,positive
also on her side is sir william cecil sir richard attenborough her wellmeaning but misguided chief adviser,positive
with few people she can trust elizabeth must prove her selfworth any way she can even if it means being the ironfisted ruler she secretly despises,positive
blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth,positive
she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky selfconsciousness and shrewd charisma,positive
though not a classical beauty blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk,positive
she is at home with her characters playful tendencies particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley joseph fiennes,positive
whether fending off unctuous suitors or playing the houses in court blanchetts elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike,positive
almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapurs visual delights,positive
he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes,positive
rolling green hills extravagant ceremonial galas dark and foreboding corridors all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation,positive
the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here,positive
though writer michael hirsts script gets a little murky at times and his injections of humor get a little overplayed elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing,positive
as a whole the story survives because elizabeths struggle is one which deserves attention,positive
by the time she makes her shocking but very sensible final declaration were ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen,positive
for example in happy gilmore sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a selfconfident jerk of a pro,positive
if the star were any other comic that would be enough motivation to drive the movie but with sandler the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house,positive
that extra motive doesnt make happy gilmore a funnier movie,positive
it doesnt really add any genuine emotional depth either,positive
in fact the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie,positive
but sandlers philosophy seems to be if its a token gesture why not make it a nice gesture,positive
that is endlessly refreshing,positive
in the wedding singer sandler is right on track,positive
the fact that hes a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story,positive
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important,positive
david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm,positive
he could make fun of the fat ugly or embarrassing people he meets at weddings and the story would be intact,positive
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character,positive
he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family,positive
robbie hart sandler doesnt just sing at weddings he also gets the loners to join in and have fun and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing,positive
he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding,positive
the day comes when robbie has his own wedding and he is stood up by his heavymetal bride the movie is set in 1985,positive
robbie takes it hard,positive
he doesnt sleep he doesnt eat and he gets punched out at work when he sings love stinks at a wedding,positive
julia drew barrymore who waitresses all the weddings in town gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to,positive
eventually robbie starts rebounding toward julia,positive
he really likes her but shes engaged,positive
her fianc is a selfconfident jerk do i see a trend nope just a formula who doesnt deserve her but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand,positive
julia seems to like robbie too but she cant leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc for the offchance that robbie might be serious about her,positive
you know the story,positive
youve seen it a million times before,positive
theres always a new way to tell it with new lovers new chemistry and new details but its the same story,positive
and sometimes it works,positive
the wedding singer works,positive
first of all the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective,positive
actually its not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each ones own romantic tension,positive
sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man struck with an unattainable love,positive
barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with,positive
sparks dont fly when they kiss but they both seem right for each other,positive
second their love is mature,positive
they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction theyre a cute couple but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material,positive
instead they are both looking for someone meaningful someone to settle down with someone to grow old with,positive
at a wedding robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by,positive
the repulsing situation is taken in stride as if the two were already parents caring for their sick child,positive
the 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie,positive
other critics liked this movie in part because of the 80s soundtrack,positive
i liked it in spite of the soundtrack,positive
often the music and references felt forced,positive
for example robbie tells his exfianc to get out of my van halen tshirt before you jinx the band and they break up,positive
ha ha ha,positive
get it,positive
david lee roth did leave van halen,positive
or how about when sammy allen covert robbies chauffeur friend shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and get this a single silver glove,positive
thats exactly what mj used to wear all the time,positive
unfortunately making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding,positive
thats not to say the movie isnt funny,positive
screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before billy madison and happy gilmore and the two make a good combination,positive
herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straightfaced smartaleck style,positive
lets hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over,positive
with barrymores charm and sandlers heart it was hard to go wrong,positive
an indian runner was more than a courier,positive
he became the message he was carrying,positive
what danger is a bear to a message,positive
i used to think sean penn was an immature arrogant photographer punching madonnamarrying loudmouth,positive
but all that has changed now,positive
the guy has grown up,positive
and thats not all,positive
it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director if this film is any indication,positive
one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper,positive
but no,positive
this film is about a real struggle and the victories and defeats are not simple,positive
penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters without unnecessary rush or flash,positive
the focus of the story is two brothers,positive
david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer,positive
viggo mortensen is the wild brother whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he cant name much less resolve,positive
the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line,positive
it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared,positive
the film is unobtrusive simple direct plain and sincere,positive
it isnt exactly perfect but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them,positive
life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems,positive
this is a good film without big budget sets or big name stars pushed into your face,positive
in fact im reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing,positive
there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw,positive
i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified though there are a few freeform sections which also work very well,positive
the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche but what are you going to dothis movie does take place in the 1960s after all,positive
in my opinion it is worth fullprice admission,positive
david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director,positive
with his distinctive more often than not ingenious dialogue and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible,positive
some of them tend to be thickly layered deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message or sometimes even a concealed storyline,positive
and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors it is still a brilliantly complex consistently riveting motion picture about honor about sacrifice and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right,positive
oh and its rated g,positive
incidentally this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone elses work namely a play by terrence rattigan set in the 19th century,positive
he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow a rich aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note,positive
did you do it he asks his boy,positive
no father i didnt ronnie answers,positive
thats enough for arthur who with his oldest daughter rebecca pidgeon immediately starts a crusade to bring his sons case to court,positive
they enlist the help of sir robert morton a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task,positive
it all seems fairly frivolous and no matter how you look at it the winslow case is not the trial of the century,positive
but arthur is determined to keep his familys word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that,positive
soon enough sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings,positive
so do we,positive
all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue but his style is still fairly apparent,positive
the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense,positive
but this is not mamets norm and its refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks gangsters as con men wonderful as those films were,positive
nigel hawthornes performance is nearly flawless,positive
his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game,positive
we pity the man but we also like him,positive
rebecca pidgeon david mamets wife who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthurs oldest daughter a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the womens suffrage movement,positive
the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one,positive
be honest did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill,positive
if you wanted to but didnt this is a movie for you,positive
it is the epitome of subtlety its powerful without being too emotional sad without even trying to be depressing,positive
david mamet can churn out some great scripts but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too,positive
he is almost a national treasure,positive
his films deserve their own genre,positive
1999 eugene novikov137,positive
50s aliens vs,positive
earth idea revamped,positive
if you have been following the movie news over the net you could not have escaped the hype over id4,positive
it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary,positive
id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july and up till now only after a week of release it has nearly touched the us100 million mark a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993,positive
the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple earth defends itself against the aliens a typical and highly popular 50s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era,positive
the movie opens via star wars however unoriginal it may be it worked,positive
the aliens have sent a large mother ship supposedly to be 14 size of the moon to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth,positive
the us president pullman does not know of the aliens intention but soon finds out when david goldblum a scientist discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities,positive
capt hiller smith a hotshot f18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc,positive
his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders he crash lands after a spectacular 1on1 chase over the grand canyon one of the many highlights of the movie,positive
id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses,positive
acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle do we smell a bit of braveheart here,positive
no prizes for guessing how id4 ends its just plain obvious,positive
id4 borrows heavily from star wars return of the jedi alien and in some parts of the movie i could even sense a bit of xfiles on screen,positive
if i were to critically review this movie id4 is full of plot holes corny dialogue and ridiculously dumb aliens,positive
however below that waferthin plot and onscreen flaws id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion,positive
an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie thus maintaining a screenviewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable no matter how ridiculous,positive
id4 was produced under a modest budget of us68 million a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich universal soldier stargate and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company,positive
some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable especially the epic standoff between 150 f18s and 250 alien saucers reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi,positive
id4 is a movie for all,positive
though there are many explosions and implied deaths there are no gory scenes of human destruction thus young kids should be able to take it,positive
sit back and dont be too critical chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was,positive
if you are not planning to watch any movies this year please at least make time for this one,positive
this film is best watched on the bigscreen,positive
what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg and starring one of the biggest boxoffice stars in the world harrison ford,positive
you get one hotfudgerockin good time thats what you get,positive

watching this movie made me feel like a kid again dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys travelling to different countries making the impossible possible,positive
harrison ford is perfect as the everyman with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action fun adventure and humor,positive
now if you really want to have a good time check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels rent a jug of iced coke truckloads of nachos and salsa an adventure hat and whip and prepare to gag yourself into a world of actionmovie heaven,positive
little known facts about this film and its stars this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations including best picture,positive
it lost that award to chariots of fire but did manage to win for best art direction best special effects best film editing and best sound,positive
actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones but was committed to his hit tv show magnum p i,positive
in filming the well of souls sequence the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on,positive
hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas,positive
however once all the snakes were on set it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths and these were used as well,positive
looking closely you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not,positive
an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra,positive
during his escape from the museum where it was housed he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong,positive
also in the same script indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild minecart chase sequence,positive
both of these scenes were cut from the script but ended up in 1984s indiana jones and the temple of doom,positive
this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo,positive
the same type of opening is present in its sequels,positive
jocks airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number obcpo,positive
this is a reference to obiwan and c3po from george lucas star wars 9 510,positive
also the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2d2 and c3po,positive
they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark,positive
the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip,positive
as legend has it actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time and asked if the scene could be shortened,positive
spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy,positive
the entire crew laughed and thats how it was filmed,positive
when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra you can see the snakes reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford also some fingerprints and stuff like that,positive
when indy is dragging along the ground hanging onto the nazi soldiers truck with the ark inside you can see the pad that hes being dragged on,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction the cinematic output from its creator quentin tarantino has been surprisingly low,positive
oh hes been busy doing the talk show circuit taking small roles in various films overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn making cameo appearances on television shows providing a vignette for the illfated anthology four rooms everything it seems except direct another featurelength film,positive
its been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr tarantinos new feature film jackie brown one of the most anticipated films of the year and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s,positive
things arent going well for jackie brown pam grier,positive
shes 44 years old stuck at a deadend job 16 000 a year plus retirement benefits that arent worth a damn as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america and shes just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton and police officer mark dargus michael bowen smuggling 50 000 from mexico for gunrunner ordell robbie samuel l jackson who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry robert forster,positive
the loquacious ordell based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny bonghitting surfer girl melanie bridget fonda and agreeable crony louis gara robert de niro hang out operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat and hes soon out to silence jackie brown,positive
meanwhile the authorities target is ordell and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a halfmillion dollars,positive
only through a series of clever twists turns and doublecrosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses,positive
although jackie brown marks mr tarantinos first produced screenplay adaptation based on the elmore leonard novel rum punch theres no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film,positive
while hes adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead characters now black,positive
in terms of ambiance the film harkens back to the 1970s from the walltowall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions,positive
the opening sequence featuring ms grier wordlessly striding through the lax funky music blaring away on the speakers is emblematic of films of that era,positive
the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro,positive
of course nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists backstabbing and deceptions deliciously unfold the strength of jackie brown is the quiet understated relationship developed between jackie and max when they kiss its perhaps the most tender scene of the year,positive
tenderness in a quentin tarantino film,positive
sure thereve been moments of sweetness in his prior films the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer or even in reservoir dogs where a deep unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters but for the most part mr tarantinos films are typified by manic energy unexpected outbursts of violence and clever often wordy banter,positive
these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown but whats new here is a different facet of his storytelling a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation,positive
this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr tarantino as simply a helmer of slick hip crime dramas with fasttalking lowlifes and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent hes the real deal,positive
this new aspect of mr tarantinos storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character that of the worldweary sensitive and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching,positive
mr forsters nuanced understated performance is the best in the film he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie we smile along with him,positive
much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead with the wags buzzing that mr tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travoltas thensagging career,positive
as it turns out ms grier is solid in the films title role although nothing here forces her to test her range,positive
i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection though shes been working steadily over the years often in directtovideo action flicks but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burtons mars attacks,positive
and larry cohens original gangstas where she first teamed up with mr forster,positive
of course its true that her role here was a godsend a meaty a part as this is rarity for any actress let alone one of her age and current status in the industry,positive
while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone it marks tremendous growth of mr tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding and whose characterizations have never been better,positive
and while the films narrative doesnt really warrant a running time of 155 minutes its filled with such sumptuous riches ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining inconsequential conversations between the characters that there wasnt an unengaging moment,positive
with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt itll be interesting to see what he tries next,positive
through a spyglass i could see everything,positive
king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 1793 but instead of visualizing this act of regicide legendary auteur eric rohmers the lady and the duke observes from afar,positive
consider it a view to a kill made abstract,positive
a proper british yes british gentlewoman grace elliott lucy russell and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants,positive
the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope often muttering i dont know as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air,positive
what we dont see might not be able to hurt us,positive
just close your eyes and think of england,positive
during times of revolution the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them,positive
adapted from elliotts memoirs journal of my life during the french revolution rohmers latest artistic tourdeforce may seem far removed from his domestic comedies tales of the four seasons etc a period film set during the most violent changes in french history,positive
resisting the temptation for grandscale theatrics much of the lady and the duke is about quiet decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes,positive
grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist a headstrong snobbish blueblood one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along,positive
a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own graces life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover the kings hotblooded cousin prince philipe duke of orleans jeanclaude dreyfus,positive
the times are changing though and the gears inch ever closer toward violence,positive
during the september massacres of 1792 she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the dukes sisterinlaw on a stake,positive
rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil old fashioned almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob,positive
in doing so he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not the face of death,positive
when grace sees her friends disembodied head on a pole rohmers attention drifts from the societal change to one womans reaction shot laden with hot tears,positive
grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice sheltering him from the mob,positive
through her relationship with the duke she seeks a passport for this one activists escape,positive
grace doesnt even understand her own actions and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger,positive
she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers ceaseless police monitoring house searches even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence,positive
maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life her imperious attitude to the servants never changes she becomes a heroine through circumstance,positive
the events themselves are intrusions upon her person her home and therefore her values,positive
aristocracy proves a glass house one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones,positive
the duke is called to vote on the kings punishment and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors talk means nothing in the face of bloody action or futile inaction,positive
the episodic structure creates a wobbly jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification,positive
lazy viewers and critics may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke,positive
thats foolery but brings up the valid criticism that rohmers characters occasionally become didactic,positive
rohmers imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future,positive
what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmers use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism,positive
the actors were filmed against a bluescreen then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris,positive
this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wideopen streets,positive
it looks as phony as titanic but unlike james camerons debacle the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone,positive
why,positive
they arent real,positive
the very foundation rohmers characters stand upon is false and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves in all their insubstantial glory,positive
screened at the 2001 new york film festival feature coming soon,positive
the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films,positive
one was gattaca,positive
the other was the thirteenth floor,positive
just as gattaca was overshadowed by the mighty titanic the thirteenth floor was relegated to obscurity by the matrix,positive
however the thirteeth floor though it deals with similar themes is a much better movie than the frenetic childish and improbable matrix,positive
a cutting edge computer scientist hannon fuller played by the charming armin muellerstahl is murdered,positive
his associate douglas hall craig bierko apparently framed and suspected by the police enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery,positive
along the way a beautiful blonde gretchen mol more bodies and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture,positive
the thirteenth floor unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise,positive
the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view,positive
first its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline,positive
second and more seriously it demands that its audience think and feel,positive
no wonder it fell through the cracks,positive
done in film noir style as a murder mystery this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels,positive
many audiences will simply be bewildered by it rather than engaged which is a shame because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment,positive
i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie,positive
despite its philosophical challenges the thirteenth floor derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller mol and douglas hall bierko as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller,positive
in that sense it is more akin to gattaca than the matrix which for all of its cute philosophical byplay is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever,positive
the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying wrenching and intellectually challenging,positive
in its final moments the film even takes on itself when david janes husband who has come to enjoy killing accuses her of being the sick one,positive
although there is a victory for the leading characters this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane and thus a deepseated character flaw,positive
in fact hannon fullers activities in the simulated world the behavior of janes husband and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters,positive
this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil,positive
the tragedy is not in their stars but in themselves,positive
the major actors all of whom are required to play two or even three roles perform extremely well,positive
bierko who will be familiar as the psycho from the long kiss goodnight is outstanding,positive
donofrio as whitney who plays a pivotal role in support also turns in a good performance,positive
the lovely gretchen mol whose elegance integrity and determination suggest bergman in casablanca does a wonderful job,positive
her voice however lacks the necessary weight at times,positive
this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script,positive
some minor flaws hairline cracks in fine porcelain appear in places,positive
there are one or two instances of jerky editing,positive
the script takes the edge off the films climaxes,positive
the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times yet there is a clue there too,positive
one wonders if even after two decades blade runner is still casting its long shadow over scifi films,positive
one can see a group of suits in their suite waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in amadeus make it more likeblade runner you know dark and rainy,positive
the thirteen floor is that rare exception among hollywood movies a rich emotionally satisfying intelligent scifi movie,positive
and yet ultimately it proves the suits right,positive
for when good scifi is made where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it,positive
if we dont support great sf who will,positive
lets face it since waterworld floated by the summer movie season has grown very stale,positive
with no new eyecandy for four weeks straight weve had to sustain ourselves on the quasinutritional value of cheatin husbands traveling chocolate salesmen and computer generated serial killers,positive
sigh,positive
thank god for desperado,positive
the freewheeling sequel to el mariachidirector robert rodriguezs notorious 7000 debutstars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name,positive
hes a man in black with revenge on his mind and an arsenal in his case,positive
the woman he loved was killed in the first film,positive
so he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers sort of a texmex version of the punisher if you will,positive
there isnt much of an emotional core to desperado,positive
rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo,positive
and sergio leone,positive
and sam peckinpah,positive
some may wince at the body countat least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimatebut its all played for laughs,positive
big broad hispanic laughs that for me recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films,positive
sick slick fun,positive
cinema has been around for about a hundred years now,positive
its not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film but id like to think that im beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time,positive
recently ive seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others,positive
those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius,positive
they are likely to be remembered for,positive
well quite a while,positive
i like this film too,positive
yes its a disasterslashaction movie,positive
true its budget is a lot more money than ill ever see in my lifetime,positive
and theres not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money,positive
in fact i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film had they thought it wouldve been more profitable,positive
i certainly dont care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such a skilled director that i doubt hed ever make a film that is difficult to sit through,positive
of course skillful direction doesnt complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together,positive
the story is wellthought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters,positive
yes you read that right,positive
armageddon actually has characters you can care about,positive
if you dont like this film then you have a problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as a film like this can be,positive
if youve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story,positive
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film,positive
so its up to the u s government to stop it,positive
why the u s is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated,positive
their plan to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate a nuclear warhead within,positive
the head driller is harry stamper bruce willis,positive
his group of men is a colorful bunch including a j,positive
ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi,positive
theres also an interesting triangle formed between a j harry and grace liv tyler who is harrys daughter,positive
a j,positive
and grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isnt too happy with the situation,positive
its absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is youd like to call armageddon,positive
its not about story its about viscera and action and thrillsaminute and all that stuff,positive
its incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens,positive
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better,positive
i think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles,positive
take the spectacular opening scene for instance in which a meteor shower obliterates new york,positive
a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars,positive
the action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways,positive
i like his quickedit style because its abrasive and exhausting to watch,positive
its also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times,positive
but its fun to be obnoxious sometimes,positive
the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame,positive
deep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable,positive
special effects are very important in a film like this if theyre not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesnt work,positive
everything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid,positive
the effects that dont look totally real are still a pleasure to behold and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nicelooking that it actually qualifies as art,positive
of course all of this would add up to little more than an aboveaverage light show if i didnt get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action,positive
the film is two and a half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action,positive
much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots,positive
i wont suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions arent put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way,positive
in fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and thats a lot more than i can say about deep impact which was banking on the feelgood parts of its story,positive
bruce willis is terrific and im glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing,positive
tyler and affleck are great together and make a convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level,positive
patton who is a magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his exwife and son is very moving,positive
the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays a crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the film lively and funny,positive
i wasnt challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and i dont mind too much,positive
but the film doesnt insult my intelligence its pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really wants to do,positive
its not mindless and escapist but wellcrafted cinema,positive
it might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget,positive
im not saying that films like this are risky moves,positive
what i am saying is that armageddon is a big loud expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms,positive
psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred,positive
a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget third rate ripoff,positive
but no this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argentos most consistently successful film,positive
what impresses most in rewatching this surrealistic supernatural thriller is that argentos directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a nearfully coherent narrative,positive
screenplays have always been his achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents and reactions,positive
no question argento has always been a better director than a writer,positive
fortunately he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis,positive
the films storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches,positive
jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance,positive
arriving at the school late at night in driving rain she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state,positive
what happens next and i dont make the comparison lightly is a murder sequence that for intensity shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcocks infamous shower scene in psycho,positive
its quite possibly a homage to hitchcock but with its baroque sets graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin this stunning sequence remains very much argentos own,positive
though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspirias opening 15 minutes the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school,positive
we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious souroldmatriarchfromhell roles she does so well,positive
several more violent murders ensue including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is well i wouldnt want to spoil things now would i and the films climax staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms has a gothic ghoulishness thats most impressive,positive
the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming and not just for the violence deep red and phenomena for example have been appallingly hacked about,positive
fortunately the cuts to suspiria about 7 minutes in this version have not adversely affected the film,positive
the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done too excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region,positive
and the soundtrack,positive
it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else,positive
as it stands the use of goblins music in suspiria is outstanding,positive
apparently argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts,positive
a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewers overall experience,positive
even better see suspiria in a cinema where youll get the added bonus of widescreen,positive
and the colours,positive
deep reds eerie blues a superb use of shadow and contrast,positive
the cinematography of luciano tovoli whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female is uniformly superb,positive
a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors,positive
these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argentos more surreal excursions the other most notable example being inferno 1980 on which bassan also worked,positive
suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors and it is fully deserving of its cult status,positive
the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated thats always been one of argentos shortcomings but overall this is a fascinating compelling example of italian horror,positive
synopsis retiring detective jerry black nicholson becomes involved in the case of a murdered girl and promises her parents that he will find the killer,positive
he purchases a gas station on a route he believes the killer takes and there befriends lori wright penn and her young daughter,positive
as jerry and lori fall in love can he do what must be done to fulfill his pledge,positive
review at first the pledge appears to be just another standard if wellexecuted crime drama,positive
it is anything but in its final hour it turns the corner and becomes a riveting terrifying study of its lead character jerry black,positive
penn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre but they are just window dressing,positive
his interest here unequivocally is jerry a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes the entirety of the his existence,positive
at first we see this only in small hints some of his habits change for instance and he suddenly takes up smoking in a big way,positive
but then when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus,positive
nicholson is fantastic portraying black with rare subtlety and animus jerrys gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from,positive
penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast too,positive
only eckhart disappoints as jerrys replacement stan he never seems entirely convincing too much a tool of the plot,positive
penns direction is astounding each frame looking as though it is parched of water perhaps or of sanity,positive
it all builds up to a shattering devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably in the mind long after the house lights have come up,positive
originally entitled dancing about architecture i e,positive
talking about love is like dancing about architecture but changed because it sounded too much like the recent boxoffice dud dancing at lughnasa this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names playing interesting and wellwritten characters within a vignettesstyled plot arrangement a la robert altman,positive
plot follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love finding themselves regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are and who they want and appreciating the fine emotional art of love,positive
critique charmingly effective romantic drama this film offers insight into various types of relationships presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties,positive
how do people fall in love,positive
why do people fall out of love,positive
how do people fall back into love once theyve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club,positive
all of these questions and more are touched upon in this film within several types of variant relationships,positive
meet a hip young couple going through their first date,positive
a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships,positive
a married woman finding herself while cheating on her husband,positive
a husband letting go of his inhibitions,positive
an older couple dealing with a past love of the man a secret recently uncovered,positive
a son dying from aids joined by his mother at the hospital,positive
there are many nuances to this picture and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate but more importantly there is diversity,positive
diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels,positive
some related to the younger couples issues,positive
others with the married,positive
theres a little bit of everything for everyone in here,positive
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year i would relate myself to yet another predicament,positive
just like love itself this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels,positive
the actors in this film are all also very very good,positive
sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve as is gena rowlands as the aging wife with trepidations,positive
jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance while philippe is as prettyboy as ever,positive
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to reignite her love life opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talkshow host jon stewart,positive
even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination,positive
the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached was the part surrounding jay mohr the man dying from aids and his mother ellen burstyn,positive
the actors were fine but somehow the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else,positive
the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me but i guess thats just hollywood,positive
this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors 5 510 and happiness 4 510 in concept and style but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness,positive
the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care as opposed to this film which offers rich and believable characters living real lives and talking about real issues in todays relationships,positive
all in all this movie offers many interesting characters talking and living genuine and engaging love lives wonderful performances by its solid cast too sweet of an ending but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless,positive
little known facts about this film and its stars according to a story in the london sunday mirror sean connery asked for only 60 000 for his role in this movie as compared to his usual fee of 14 million because he liked the script so much,positive
on top of that he convinced his costars including gena rowlands gillian anderson ellen burstyn et al to do the same,positive
this is willard carroll second real foray into the world of adult films,positive
before this he had written and produced many childrens movies,positive

chasing amy 710 and the texas chainsaw massacre 810 at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date,positive
hollywood has a 750,positive
batting average with elmore leonard adaptations,positive
last years touch was illconceived and just plain odd but get shorty jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies,positive
steven soderburgh master of sex lies and videotape now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery prison doublecrossing uncut diamonds and oh yeah true love,positive
george clooney is the protagonist a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker but for once i didnt want to slap the taste out of his mouth,positive
he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary granttype perfected in hitchcock movies the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other,positive
nowhere present is clooneys usual aintisexy sneer theres just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style,positive
clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty,positive
clooney plays a man whos robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun,positive
in the opening scene he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm,positive
of course he gets caught so its not all good,positive
its while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmates albert brooks in a frightful bald wig collection of diamonds in detroit,positive
clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans,positive
meanwhile theres jennifer lopez,positive
unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda shes finally graduated to a worthy role as the u s marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes,positive
rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car and lopez makes it a threesome her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney,positive
hes covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck and its a little cramped in there but they manage to make a love connection anyway probably because its a movie,positive
the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noirish crime story,positive
the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime and this is no exception,positive
although theyre not really germane to the plot lopezs relationship with her father dennis farina of get shorty rhames relationship with his christian sister you could call her sister christian and a popin cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it,positive
out of sight spans at least three years but has a nonlinear structure focusing on the jailbreak brooks score and flashing back to earlier times,positive
this is a movie with a brain as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves,positive
the entire cast does the material justice clooney and lopez coming into their own and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites,positive
heres hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch,positive
serving america for almost 120th of a century,positive
to me nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film,positive
despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence,positive
ever since the big success of the actionthriller in 1997 the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr cage,positive
the perpetually awful assassination thriller snake eyes was one of 1998s worst films,positive
8mm was a disappointing lost cause,positive
but who better than scorsese to match cages wit and intensity which he does in miraculous fashion with bringing out the dead,positive
cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from daytoday,positive
after five years of the stressinducing job frank basically just staggers onward relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends,positive
he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care namely a young girl named rose who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york,positive
frank desperately wants to be fired but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ill fire you tomorrow he promises,positive
frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance,positive
the first is larry john goodman who always has food on the brain,positive
the second is marcus ving rhames a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation,positive
and finally tom tom sizemore is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood,positive
i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank but they never figured into the actual plot,positive
each is merely a colorful presence to help develop franks character because bringing out the dead is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality,positive
the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary patricia arquette the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack,positive
arquette who recently received the wounds of christ in stigmata performs well around reallife husband cage,positive
its unfortunate that after such intriguing character trials and tribulations the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled ineffective finale,positive
the movie belongs to the onetwo punch of cage and scorsese who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to bringing out the dead,positive
although it certainly lacks the grit and hardedge of something like goodfellas scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture,positive
the incredible camerawork and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration,positive
fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997s kundun,positive
does bringing out the dead rival scorseses finest work,positive
only occasionally,positive
some of the film feels surprisingly limp but there is enough energy in its interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice,positive
those expecting a grisly risqu product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straightarrow approach but its still a solid admirable effort,positive
bringing out the dead was written by the acclaimed paul schrader who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as taxi driver and raging bull,positive
schraders script is full of moments wonderful sharply defined moments that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay,positive
the exceptional aspects of the film are its astounding technical credits and the amazing cast,positive
goodman and sizemore are both electric well mainly sizemore but its the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look,positive
watch the actors deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member and youll understand why he won a golden globe,positive
bringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough to mask its certain flaws,positive
scorsese and cage for that matter have done better but their intentions are certainly admirable,positive
remember what the mpaa says horrific and deplorable violence is ok as long as you dont say any naughty words,positive
featuring the voice talents of matt stone trey parker mary kay bergman,positive
rated r,positive
filmmakers jump on reallife controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell,positive
the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up and already someones made a movie about it and its not thank god a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy,positive
instead we get a sharp biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed,positive
based on a popular and controversial cable tv show south park bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights,positive
the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian rrated movie and learn some naughty words,positive
when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms they decide to blame canada wage war against the neighbor country and execute terrence and phillip the flatulent actors in the obscene film,positive
the kids form an alliance they name la resistance with the accent on the third syllable of resistance to save their favorite thespians in a hilarious spoof of tribute to,positive
les mis rables,positive
in a subplot one of the characters kenny who else,positive
dies and goes to hell where he meets satan,positive
satan and saddam hussein are lovers you see,positive
satan is a benevolent soul while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex,positive
apparently too if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth,positive
aside from being a brilliant satire south park is also an allstopsout musical with unforgettable numbers like shut your f ing face uncle f er and cartmans mom is a big fat bitch,positive
almost invariably its funny stuff often juvenile but always funny,positive
the same can be said for the rest of the movie its intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner i e,positive
toilet humor endless profanity etc,positive
not that theres anything wrong with that vulgarity when done right is my bag baby,positive
trey parker and matt stone the twentysomethings behind the film and the show paint a bullseye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it,positive
cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaas rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities arent uttered the auteurs throw some nasty oneliner insults their way,positive
the ratingsaplenty association isnt the only target of this unsparing banter people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game with the blame canada plot being a notsocheap shot at them,positive
the distinctively lowtech cardboard animation is oddly effective even more so than the state of the art deep canvas technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan,positive
its more pleasant to look at less intimidating up on the screen and most importantly it doesnt detract from the films concept as much as disneys admirably aweinspiring work does,positive
the shows popularity has been waning as of late and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings,positive
perhaps not,positive
having seen the show on numerous occasions i can say that its not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie,positive
the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years,positive
parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask must the show go on,positive
1999 eugene novikov137,positive
first i am not a big fan of the xfiles tv series,positive
i have nothing against it particularly i just dont happen to watch it,positive
having said that i can now say that i liked the xfiles pretty well,positive
for us nonfans theres nothing big going for it but there are a lot of little things,positive
the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 000 b c,positive
two protohumans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside,positive
the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien,positive
the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy lucas black from sling blade is captured by the same black ooze,positive
we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder gillian anderson and david duchovny who have been pulled off of their previous assignment investigations into the paranormal and put onto the bomb squad detail,positive
a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas texas,positive
on a hunch mulder checks out the building across the street and wouldnt you know it he turns out to be right,positive
the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse,positive
five people die in the blast and when mulder learns who the victims were a light bulb goes on over his head,positive
the two agents team up to investigate against fbi orders the links mulder has made,positive
their search leads them back to the north texas cave all across the country and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to the truth,positive
the plot and the truth are uninspired,positive
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me,positive
it didnt,positive
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them,positive
but the point of the xfiles is not what the truth is but the extent to which it has been hidden,positive
its a slightly more interesting angle but it still raises expectations about that truth too high,positive
if this were the whole film i would say the movie was mediocre perhaps even boring,positive
but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it,positive
the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest,positive
before the audience can get tired of one location the agents follow a hot tip to another location and so on and so forth,positive
the locations are not all computergenerated sets either,positive
there are some artificial settings but the desert night of nevada the edge of suburbia in texas and the endless fields of snow in antarctica actually somewhere in north america,positive
make this fantastic film feel more real,positive
ward russells cinematography is very good,positive
the overall look is dark and ominous appropriate to the intended tone of the films plot,positive
russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding,positive
when the movie is set in darkness the picture quality is still rich and detailed,positive
finally and specifically there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train,positive
i dont know if the shot is faked in any way but it looks dangerous and it looks great,positive
the movies soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film skip,positive
to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie there is a spoiler in the following sentences during the opening prehistoric sequence a howling wind dogs the soundtrack never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound,positive
in one of the movies most effective sequences metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees,positive
the visuals of the scene are good but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound,positive
there was no question as to who the movies stars would be,positive
even so duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination,positive
both are easy on the eyes and together they have some good timing banter and energy,positive
there is a hint of chemistry between them but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship,positive
they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street,positive
there might be some romantic interest but for now theyre more interested in their environs than they are in each other,positive
no single element really makes this movie outstanding not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular,positive
but enough things were done right that the xfiles is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along,positive
only a year after the initial release of scream the horror sendup from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre the inevitable sequel scream 2 has arrived in our theaters,positive
while the tongueincheek parodic element is still noticeable in this film its really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story,positive
the first film while often violent and gruesome was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant,positive
the premise of scream 2 is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called stab based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers courtney cox about the events in scream is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening,positive
i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy,positive
its conclusion in which a bleeding wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think its a publicity stunt is more surreal and disturbing than anything else,positive
the satire in scream 2 thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general,positive
although resident horror film geek randy jamie kennedy is back with fresh dialogue about sequels and interestingly enough how they are usually inferior to their predecessors the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well,positive
everything from friends and saved by the bell to showgirls and terminator 2 is referenced here horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning and there arent any wes carpenter jokes this time,positive
more importantly this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film,positive
the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from scream in fact the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety and one man seems willing to save the heroines life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show,positive
understandably scream 2 does not go so far as to actually blame the movies but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted,positive
couple that with the fact that several of the characters most notably the lead character sidney prescott neve campbell are fairly welldeveloped and that there are some genuine moments of spinechilling suspense and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right,positive
we dont just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered and in one case a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner,positive
while i have not seen any of his other work its easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated slasher film director as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing,positive
unfortunately scream 2 occasionally reverts to the timehonored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window,positive
for example several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion,positive
there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that s he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction,positive
as for the question of whether or not scream 2 is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor,positive
well its hard to say,positive
i gave the first scream 3 12 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a lighthearted sendup,positive
scream 2 bounces all over the place stylistically but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment,positive
im not sure which is the better movie but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing sequels however much randy might argue do not necessarily suck,positive
the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director he really is,positive
he wrote this film he directed this film he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film,positive
i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost its popularity or its ability to scare the wits out of people,positive
i think i have seen halloween over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen,positive
i own three different versions of the film a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary tshirt a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally remastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snowglobe,positive
in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film,positive
it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 4 and 7 being truly good,positive
it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan,positive
since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 000 copies i knew i had to buy one no matter what,positive
i did and man to me its the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film,positive
no words can describe the dvd,positive
in halloween michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963,positive
now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield illinois followed by his past doctor sam loomis,positive
the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut,positive
why is he stalking her,positive
check out halloween ii it explains it all,positive
on this unholy night on october 31 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives which is trying to stay alive,positive
the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk,positive
nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did,positive
what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a groundbreaking new film with scares wit and style,positive
the movie is flawless if not perfect,positive
no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one and in my opinion never will,positive
halloween will be like psycho and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later,positive
i just hope someday halloween will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition,positive
halloween isnt just another sliceanddice horror flick its an intelligent horrifying and best film experience ever made,positive
see halloween and be scared then,positive
watch it again,positive
reviewed by brandon herring october 7 1999,positive
youll go ape over tarzan because its more fun than a barrel of monkeys,positive
okay theres the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie,positive
disneys latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship,positive
father mother and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson,positive
its amazing the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack,positive
before you know it an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala glenn close a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard,positive
against the wishes of her mate and family leader kerchak lance henricksen she takes on the infant boy as her own,positive
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild,positive
much of tarzans young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his father which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how wellmeant his attempts,positive
all hes looking for is acceptance perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers but one which will ring true with a lot of adults,positive
when you really think about it this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end,positive
look back on past disney animated features and youll see the trend,positive
growing up tarzan voiced by alex d linz as a child and by tony goldwyn as an adult has a couple of friends,positive
one is an ape named terk rosie odonnell and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor wayne knight,positive
both provide the requisite comic relief timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold,positive
im beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films,positive
just fill in the blanks,positive
can you see it,positive
now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it,positive
weve already had a fish and a crab and weve had a candle and a teapot a genie and a dog a few stone statues have,positive
we had an ape and an elephant yet,positive
well there we go,positive
of course theres gotta be romance somewhere along the line so jane minnie driver gets introduced about halfway through,positive
together with her father dr porter nigel hawthorne and the big game hunter clayton brian blessed jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa,positive
she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory you tarzan me jane scene,positive
thankfully those arent the exact words,positive
however i found it distracting that tarzan is going ohh ohh ee ee one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction,positive
how does he tell his name to another ape,positive
ohh ohh ee tarzan ee ee ohh,positive
well regardless of my picky nature the romance actually works as only disney romance can purely contrived but for some reason rather believable,positive
but hey tarzans a young adult,positive
do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane,positive
isnt that illegal in most countries,positive
oh well,positive
i dont think disney will be using my quote anymore,positive
tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical,positive
theres lots of music to be sure but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time,positive
we instead get more of a phil collins concert as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material,positive
this isnt really a bad thing as the songs are very highenergy and catchy i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day its just different,positive
do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie,positive
with each new feature disney animation gets even better,positive
not necessarily by leaps and bounds but since they put out a new film each year a steady rate of improvement is apparent and this definitely shows in tarzan,positive
there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3d effect and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying,positive
the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers and had me thinking this isnt just tarzan its extreme tarzan,positive
however tarzan does not seem to have what i call its chandelier scene which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort utilizing a computerassisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking,positive
lasting but a few seconds at most its been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail,positive
as usual the voice talent is up to snuff convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters,positive
the one poor choice in casting however was rosie odonnell,positive
going into the film i didnt know she was even a part of it but when terk started talking i recognized her voice immediately,positive
her performance was fine but through the rest of the film i kept thinking thats no boy ape that rosie odonnell,positive
distracting to say the least,positive
ill admit ive never read the edgar rice burroughs story tarzan of the apes so i couldnt tell you how true this film stays to the book,positive
but unless youre a purist you should have few objections to this film,positive
with solid performances action adventure a bit of romance and great music and animation tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us,positive
note when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago i went off on the promotional and merchandising tieins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature,positive
this time ill just say that i went to mcdonalds yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry and tarzan was on the cup,positive
nuff said,positive
it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a i,positive
artificial intelligence just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material,positive
for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home an outcast seeking family themes very familiar from most of spielbergs body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e t,positive
to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan naming just a few examples,positive
a i is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies,positive
it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances,positive
the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions and with the number of births limited by the government many couples are yearning for children,positive
and professor hobby william hurt has the solution,positive
a robotic boy named david haley joel osment who is programmed to love,positive
as a test david is placed with henry swinton sam robards and his wife monica frances oconnor,positive
their naturalborn son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness,positive
the first third of a i,positive
deals with davids life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son martin,positive
circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons,positive
he is abandoned and alone,positive
david highly influenced by the fairy tale pinocchio feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monicas love for him,positive
the films second act follows davids search for the blue fairy whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish,positive
during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe jude law a robot who specializes in sex,positive
spielberg is at his top form in this sequence offering a brutal flesh fair where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers,positive
here is where kubricks influence is strongly felt as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots,positive
the savagery conjures up images from the late directors a clockwork orange,positive
at about two hours and 30 minutes the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters,positive
it is all very anticlimatic and jarring,positive
these scenes seem almost superfluous as if from a different film,positive
a i is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg13 rating,positive
it is a story combining hope and intolerance sacrifice and bigotry and while it does not coalesce perfectly the movie does offer some disturbing images,positive
but a i,positive
is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment,positive
if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination it is this lad who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david a being created for the express purpose of loving,positive
he shines when with monica beaming with love as eager as a puppy to please,positive
after being left in the woods he is confused lost hurt focusing on one objective to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mothers eyes,positive
law is pleasant as the carefree robot who really doesnt understand davids quest but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey,positive
probably the toughest role is oconnors monica,positive
playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance but as a threat to her family,positive
she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action,positive
many of a i s futuristic sets are breathtaking especially a mostly submerged new york lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps,positive
a i is a flawed film and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering even subconsciously how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera,positive
would it have been darker,positive
more cynical,positive
we will never know,positive
we can only judge what is before us on the screen a collaboration of two cinematic giants,positive
a i,positive
is a most interesting and thoughtprovoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us,positive
very few people would be unaware of beavis butthead both created and narrated by mike judge,positive
they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind,positive
you may have seen them on their television program as they snigger and make lude remarks about women anything related to sex and the music film clips that they watch,positive
in beavis butthead do america the pair finally make their big screen debut to the delight of some and the deplore of others,positive
beavis butthead yes those are their real names are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones,positive
they live their lives in front of the television,positive
the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen,positive
this happens as they sleep and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone,positive
beavis even tries to use the remote though there is no television there,positive
the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television,positive
even at this point they have no idea what has happened,positive
they look around seeing all the evidence but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television,positive
before the movie i knew that they were stupid but i didnt realise just how stupid,positive
this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film,positive
eventually they realise that their television has been stolen so they leave their sofa to go search for a television,positive
luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room looking for a television where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife,positive
this man thinking that beavis butthead are the assigned killers tells them that they can have 10 000 if they do his wife,positive
beavis butthead being the ignorant fools that they are think that he is offering them 10 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife,positive
they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to do her,positive
to them this is the best day of their lives,positive
not only are they going to lose their virginity one of their lifelong aims but most importantly they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv,positive
inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime and unbeknown to them are tracked across the country by the fbi,positive
oddly enough it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds,positive
they end up travelling right across america visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc,positive
the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations their one time out in the big world away from their television they are completely oblivious to it,positive
at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infrared operated urinals than with the geyser itself,positive
beavis butthead essentially have the journey of their lives,positive
they even get to meet the president,positive
but all they care about is getting their television back and losing their virginity,positive
this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny its unbelievable just how stupid they are and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them,positive
the humour is certainly crude but then beavis butthead are just that crude lude and rude,positive
in the end you cant help but feel sorry for them a pair of antisocial couch potatoes whose life is television,positive
in this respect and also with regard to authority such as the fbi mike judge is quite critical of amercian society,positive
if you are easily offended or find this pair particularly annoying steer clear,positive
otherwise it should keep you laughing the whole way through,positive
one note of warning dont take friends who like to imitate beavis butthead youll,positive
never hear the end of it,positive

filled with ditzy blonde ambition its a movie for highschool kids that their parents would be happy to have them see,positive
it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle a jim carrey vehicle at that,positive
and so it is,positive
the truman show is the most perplexing crazed paranoid and ribtickling morality play ive seen since idontknowwhen,positive
dont credit carrey,positive
it starts with andrew niccol gattaca who created the script ten years ago,positive
the story replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience,positive
ironically it was within these past ten years that realitybased television have become a predominant fixture into our culture,positive
who knew,positive
oneupping niccol it was when unlikely candidatedirector peter weir took the helm that things fell into place,positive
weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone deftly mixing capra with kafka throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling,positive
it was weirs first stroke of genius to create seahaven a suburban that would make spielberg cower in shame,positive
for example bystanderextras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of dog fancy,positive
the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to not leave the island,positive
credit weir for his second stroke the casting of carrey,positive
carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn on and act goofy whenever the camera is near,positive
not here,positive
his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on,positive
and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination just as well the academy rarely honors goofy comedians excepting robin williams he stretches enough to alter his hypersilly image considerably,positive
playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carreys life,positive
no pun intended,positive
better in a smaller more pivotal role is ed harris as christof who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 work the problem people character with dustin hoffmans megaglomaniac producer in wag the dog and then only slightly svengalian,positive
it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and trumans well being,positive
yes in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son and has provided the best universe he could provide,positive
he thinks,positive
rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone mrs,positive
dalloway as carreys true forbidden love sylvia very effective in another pivotal small role,positive
laura linney congo and noah emmerich copland have the unfortunate task of playing trumans wife and best friend their sitcomish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development,positive
the exception is at the very beginning where they speak into the camera wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman and for society in general,positive
there are other little problems with the script,positive
are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years,positive
was there any reason as to why in one scene it rained solely on truman even though it never had to,positive
how is it they hire hundreds of extras and none of them could drive a boat and yet truman fearful of water is helming a sailboat effortlessly,positive
and couldnt christof have turned off the wind to strand truman at sea,positive
these little contrivances however do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work,positive
the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show and we are drawn to trumans mundane existence for no other reason than it is there,positive
the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut,positive
upon leaving the theater i was looking up in the sky wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome,positive
just checking,positive

excerpt from twister production notes,positive
im sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes or twisters before,positive
i for one have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally i feel tornadocaused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes that is until i saw twister,positive
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable,positive
it will suck in cars houses livestock etc,positive
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister youll get to see all this close up,positive
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers,positive
these people are basically outoftheirmind and for the sake of obtaining data on twisteroccurrences they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes trying to get as close as they can that,positive
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them,positive
jo helen hunt is the leader of this pack of kamikazes,positive
while they are gearing up for the motherofallstorms as predicted by satellite recon bill bill paxton a former co leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo,positive
apparently bill has left his rogueish days for greener and more practical pastures as a television weatherman,positive
he catches up with his oldself and follows the pack like the good ole days bringing his wifetobe melissa jamie gertz along a citybred woman toting around with a handphone,positive
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurements of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable earlywarning system can be implemented,positive
the problem is the device has to be placed very near the twister and in its path which is practically unpredictable of destruction in order for it to function,positive
to add to their current challenge there is another group of storm chasers that is corporationfunded led by jonas cary elwes and they too have a similar device,positive
thus begins the race jos cheap government equipment with beatenup vehicles against jonass hightech computers and satellite linkups with their sleek black allterrain vans,positive
plot wise there are not really anything to shout about,positive
twister is as predictable as any summer boxoffice hit can get,positive
there is the danger of the twister the competition with jonasos more welloff team and of course the settling of differences between jo and bill this part gives the film its human substance,positive
helen hunt bill paxton and the rest of the give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie the twister itself,positive
thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm lucasfilms industrial light and magic we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock,positive
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films for action sequences,positive
like his previous film speed the tornado sequences which are essentially the action sequences are well visualised and edited,positive
audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen,positive
the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister,positive
the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this twister is definitely an effectdependent movie,positive
now that id4 fever has begun to reside and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop ets ass for the umpteenth time twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent,positive
watch it in a good theatre please,positive
the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video,positive
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,positive
pretty good bring a friend,positive
amazing potent stuff,positive
perfection,positive
see it twice,positive
i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars,positive
from my first viewing i noticed that david mamets film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning,positive
from my second viewing however i noticed that mamets script was actually a masterpiece,positive
the spanish prisoner like the usual suspects or chinatown begs for the viewers complete attention,positive
miss a scene or even a small detail and you could miss the meaning of the entire film,positive
also like the aforementioned films it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending,positive
mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games,positive
like his past gem the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much or even more than the victim,positive
because we were deceived just like the victim we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film,positive
mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end,positive
the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over without giving a right answer is unique and ingenious,positive
the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued,positive
after seeing the film again i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening,positive
his direction is very subtle as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them or think you see all of them,positive
the story follows a young up and coming businessman joe ross campbell scott who has just created a mysterious and lucrative process that everyone is trying to get their hands on,positive
soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his process,positive
through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters the rich and popular jimmy dell a secretary who has a huge crush on ross and ross boss mr klein,positive
played by steve martin rebecca pidgeon and ben gazarra respectively the supporting cast is very solid especially martin who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role,positive
the most interesting character in the film though was campbell scotts joe ross,positive
the characters transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable,positive
david mamets script is so interesting because we know people dont actually talk like the characters in the film yet we feel so connected to some of them,positive
his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge,positive
this is a must see for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie,positive
it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive so delicate so insightful and yes even so enjoyable,positive
somehow the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through,positive
set in the 1940s the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells tobey maguire ride with the devil,positive
an orphan twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr wilbur larch michael caine little voice father figure to the orphans of st cloud obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help,positive
figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage he might as well be of use dr larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics,positive
soon homer is delivering babies like a professional,positive
he refuses to perform abortions instead wondering why the couples just didnt behave more responsibly,positive
larch too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals marvels that homer continues to have such high expectations of people,positive
such is the result of an insulated upbringing,positive
though skilled in certain medical procedures homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else,positive
he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world he must go out into it,positive
befriending a young couple who had come to see dr larch he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived,positive
thus homer begins his worldly instruction with new friend candy kendall charlize theron the astronauts wife a willing tutor,positive
tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to lifes questions,positive
many of which he was unaware needed to be asked,positive
he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing,positive
michael caine is in a word brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans many of whom he helped to bring into the world,positive
calling them princes of maine kings of new england in his ritualistic goodnight mr caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine,positive
delroy lindo a life less ordinary has many powerful moments as mr rose the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins,positive
director lasse hallstrom whats eating gilbert grape and john irving the world according to garp who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter,positive
regardless of ones personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers,positive
the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers,positive
figuring the rules didnt apply to them since they didnt have a hand in writing them they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along,positive
dr larch in his own way acts similarly,positive
there is a danger in that line of reasoning,positive
god has also given us a set of rules,positive
unlike the list posted in the cider house gods rules if followed promise us benefits beyond our imagination,positive
and yet many continue to ignore his rules preferring to make up their own as they go through life,positive
trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding,positive
proverbs 3 5 kjv,positive
just as a builder follows a designers blueprint or a conductor follows a composers score why shouldnt we follow the rules of life given to us by lifes architect for our own blessing,positive
the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy,positive
but after diasappointing films such as godzilla and fear and loathing in las vegas it would be nice to see a really good film,positive
but i doubt you could have expected this,positive
the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen and it deserves a spot on the decades best list,positive
there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim yes thats what makes this film great,positive
the blend of peter weirs masterful and in many ways brilliant direction peter bizious stunning photography and jim carreys performance is what makes this film work so fantastically,positive
there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show,positive
it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect,positive
carrey has made a very wise choice,positive
by playing mildmannered truman burbank he allows himself enough room to be comical and therefore not alienating his true fans while still showing a vulnerable and human side,positive
that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes,positive
truman burbank was born to an audience of millions,positive
he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show,positive
everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians led by the shows director christof played by ed harris,positive
everyone in trumans life is an actor or an extra,positive
they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in trumans life,positive
but he is the only person that is not aware of it,positive
the classification of the truman show may be tricky,positive
the audience reacted to many of trumans revelations with laughter,positive
i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character,positive
the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes because what was happening to him indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong,positive
so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy,positive
a drama,positive
it really depends on the audience,positive
but to me the truman show was a touching sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others,positive
but above all else the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor heart and scary realism,positive
oscar predictions in june are pointless but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 as originally planned james cameron would be oscarless,positive
if you thought baz luhrmanns radical take on williamshakespearesromeojuliet was wild wait until what you see what tony awardwinning stage director julie taymor thelionking thebroadwaymusical does to the bards titusandronicus for her audaciousand very bloodyfilm debut,positive
while luhrmann transplanted the starcrossed lovers to 1990s florida taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in romebut places it in a surreal temporal limbo,positive
the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more 40s and 50s and other garments are more gladiatorlike,positive
as tamora queen of goths jessica lange exacts revenge on roman general titus anthony hopkins for killing her eldest son and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the storys underlying themes,positive
however the time convergence approach only works at times for often its just distracting as in one scene where tamoras suviving sons matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers blow off steam playing video arcade games,positive
taymor didnt have to resort to such avant garde time tricks for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them,positive
she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist the latter compliment encompassing all areas makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments,positive
she also has a sure way with actors hopkins titus is at once tragic and horrifying and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora,positive
the clear standout of the cast however is harry lennix as aaron a moor who is tamoras secret lover and a schemer in his own right,positive
lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain,positive
a great villain he indeed is but to leave it at that isnt giving full justice to his powerful and multidimensional work,positive
titus isnt a complete success but it is never less than fascinating and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice,positive
from the man who presented us with henry the portrait of a serial killer 6 510,positive
comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of floridas south coast,positive
plot guidance counselor dillon is accused of raping one of his students,positive
she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida,positive
the counselor is brought to court on the charges as another white trash girl campbell also joins the rape fingerpointing club,positive
as the story unfolds we find that many things arent exactly as they seem thats as much as i could say without ruining anything,positive
critique good little flick that slows down at certain points and runs a tad long but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout,positive
mind you i could see many people not liking it because it takes one too many twists and turns but hey i happen to like that kind of thing,positive
and besides the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability or scathingly close to and even explained many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film do not leave the theatre before you see the credits it,positive
really does clear up some stuff,positive
other than that the acting was good with campbell transforming her good girl stereotypical role into a potsmoking gothlooking white trash chick out for a good time,positive
denise richards from starship troopers 710 fame solidifies herself as hollywoods jellydonut pinup girl of the moment and proves that all breast implants neednt lead to lawsuits,positive
bacon is solid and so is dillon while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world,positive
sprinkle the story with a bunch o shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters bacon showing the world the size of his dingdong do we really need to see this a couple of lesbian kissing scenes and a menageatrois and youve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre,positive
on the down side the soundtrack was not as prominent or slick as i thought it would be and theresa russell real name theresa paup seems to have lost her way in every which way possible ooooh,positive
i almost forgot bill murrays exquisite role as the downtrodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court,positive
murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex greed and mystery,positive
little known facts neve campbell specified a nonnudity clause in her contract shes also born in guelph ontario go,positive
hoser,positive
director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together as it was gratuitous,positive
kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother called the bacon brothers is married to actress kyra sedgwick and has a game based on him called six degrees of kevin bacon,positive
plot a bigtime mommas boy cant seem to leave his mothers crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world,positive
he visits his kids and their mommas every now and then but his main goal in life is well he doesnt have any goals,positive
then one day his mother gets an exgangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isnt as welcome anymore in his own house,positive
it isnt long after that that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well its,positive
either time to grow up or bow down,positive
critique first things first,positive
this movie aint about the hood at all its an intelligent film about love relationships family friendship maturity and growing up,positive
do not avoid this film because you think its about gangbangers and stuff because it isnt at all,positive
its about you its about me its about your girlfriend your mother your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to well grow,positive
up,positive
this is an extremely wellwritten film with some of the most developed characters that ive seen on the screen all year with superb acting performances to match,positive
granted the film does start a little slow and go a little long but hang in there because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters you will be glad that you did,positive
this isnt a kids movie,positive
this is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full adulthood and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step,positive
i certainly did because i too passed and am passing through many of these very same things right now yeah yeah i still live with my momma and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick oh yeah and for the record im not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case,positive
but thats not even half the story,positive
you see the film is damn funny too and,positive
i mean damn funny,positive
i was crackin up at almost every other scene and they werent setup jokes like your typical comedies either just daytoday things that we could all relate to like the scene in which ving rhames is drinking koolaid in the kitchen and his infamously improvised african squat f k scene which you just gotta see to believe,positive
and there are the performances too,positive
ving rhames now heres a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year,positive
damn dude you scared the shit outta me,positive
tyrese gibson i have no idea where this guy came from an rb singer and mtv vj you say hmmmm but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs he nailed this part to the tee,positive
from scene one on i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day,positive
and everyone else too,positive
gibsons girlfriend in the film taraji henson made me a backer with her many subtle touches all of which helped raise her character several levels above the typical bitchie girlfriend that weve seen in many of these relationship movies,positive
but thats the thing that i liked the most about this movie,positive
everyone seemed real the situations felt authentic the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears,positive
i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch,positive
and yeah i even liked the whole homage to boyz n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end he called this movie a companion piece to that film,positive
a very solid followup to an ever greater original baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up,positive
note the guy who plays jodys best friend in this movie is omar gooding cuba gooding jr s younger brother cuba starred in 1991s boyz n the hood,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
the best man 810 brothers 510 shaft 710 summer of sam 710 whats cooking 710,positive
more than forty years ago the sword and sandals genre of historical epic ruled the box office,positive
during the 1950s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope,positive
benhur,positive
cleopatra,positive
the robe,positive
sparticus,positive
the fall of the roman empire,positive
quo vadis,positive
sometimes brilliant sometimes campy the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood,positive
since then epics have appeared infrequently the last emperor braveheart and some of the best have been smallscreen affairs produced in the 1970s roots shogun,positive
yet the phrase we who are about to die salute you has been absent until now,positive
gladiator begins in germania in a d 180,positive
roman general maximus russell crowe has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius richard harris and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting,positive
however the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus joaquin phoenix will prove a poor successor so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again,positive
when commodus hears the plan he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered,positive
maximus escapes from the executioners but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son,positive
a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa,positive
why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus place is never explained,positive
an african named juba djimon hounsou treats maximus wounds,positive
proximo oliver reed a gladiator who won his freedom purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena,positive
of course maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier and his fame spreads,positive
when commodus reopens the coliseum proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete,positive
our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus sister lucilla connie nielsen,positive
the similarities to braveheart are obvious an evil king a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family the aid of a lovestruck princess,positive
also like mel gibsons epic gladiator has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the heros anger,positive
its a simple tale of good versus evil,positive
maximus has all the manly virtues nobility of purpose courage in battle loyalty to king and country physical stamina and devotion to family,positive
commodus is his opposite in every way a sniveling selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience,positive
the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70 male and that seems appropriate,positive
gladiator is a guy movie would the opposite of a chick flick be a dick flick,positive
theres much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences,positive
those easily offended by gore should stay away,positive
lucilla is the only female character and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife,positive
joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance,positive
in the scene where commodus kills his father phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his fathers love or pride,positive
throughout the picture phoenix manages to give depth to a character whos scripted as a caricature of evil,positive
ive been a russell crowe fan since romper stomper,positive
this role doesnt offer him the complexities of his parts in l,positive
a confidential and the insider essentially his job is to grunt heroically but his voice which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp is perfect for the genre,positive
the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role,positive
i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar,positive
my only major quibble with gladiator is its stylized look,positive
several scenes are tinted,positive
weve seen a lot of the tinted look lately particularly in payback and the matrix,positive
i dont get the appeal of the style which makes feature films look like tv ads,positive
in payback it was merely annoying but in gladiator it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison detre of the roman epic,positive
perhaps its meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computergenerated shots,positive
also the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously,positive
it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books leaving a halfblurred trail of images of himself behind,positive
with a more realistic look gladiator could be even more satisfying than braveheart because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion,positive
bottom line a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices,positive
capsule bleak and pointblank just the way it should be,positive
makes its case with coldblooded precision and intelligence,positive
serial killer chic is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary and one of the more stomachturning ones,positive
ive never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry,positive
i wasnt sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic,positive
thankfully thats not the way henry works,positive
the director john mcnaughton took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work,positive
it doesnt provide cheapjack explanations for henrys behavior it shows him up for what he is an unrepentant and unidolizable man who killed when the mood struck him,positive
at the films opening henrys friend ottis toole has a sister who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago,positive
in a viciously riveting scene he admits matteroffactly to having murdered his own mother and she covers his hand with hers,positive
they are damned together from that moment on,positive
henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun,positive
the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it theres a scene where the two go to buy a new tv,positive
the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron,positive
no preface it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker,positive
in a scene which many damned the movie for unseen they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment,positive
the movie itself however does not glorify the killings but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work only irritation,positive
henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting,positive
michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame just standing there and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well,positive
the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton but he decided to give them something more memorable and consequently the film nearly didnt see release,positive
the film does not glorify or justify it just shows us with unflinching coldness what henry was,positive
im hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of victim or hero,positive
then again probably so would henry,positive
i have seen several but not that many woody allen movies,positive
i didnt particulary like radio days the purple rose of cairo play it again sam,positive
i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything,positive
sex and i loved might aphrodite,positive
however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore,positive
and bullets got some very raving reviews but i didnt think id like,positive
but i finally saw it double feature with ready to wear i think and hated it,positive
since,positive
i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasnt sure if id want to see,positive
thankfully i did,positive
people burst into singing and dancing something i hardly ever like,positive
but this movie is so infectious,positive
and funny,positive
and entertaining,positive
and unlike evita they only sing when they need to,positive
sure some of the actors may not be great singers but they seems to be having a great time and so does the audience,positive
thats all i have to say,positive
really if you think that is going to be a dull movie youre probably dead,positive
and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres,positive

he said that this is an almost ghastly misfire,positive
the movie is rated r for one use of the word motherf,positive
george little jonathan lipnicki wants a little brother,positive
after mr and mrs little hugh laurie and geena davis visit the orphange they decide to adopt stuart a talking mouse voiced by michael j fox,positive
george isnt so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house and neither is snowbell the family cat voiced by nathan lane,positive
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race but snowbell wants stuart out of the house hes unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying its ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat,positive
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery cgi,positive
the character of stuart while obviously a computer generated image grows on you as the film progresses and youll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect,positive
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film as many of the supporting cast are actual cats with computer animated mouths so they can speak,positive
its fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with,positive
stuart little is a charming family film,positive
there are some great laughs in the movie with a script cowritten by the sixth senses m night shyamalan no less,positive
some moments that can only be described as too cute the boat race sequence is what won me over and even the majority of the oneliners common nowadays in childrens films or films featuring nathan lane are tolerable,positive
kids and parents will love this one,positive
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video,positive
there are two different dvds on sale one contains the film in full frame and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 66 1,positive
both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 1 audio,positive
both versions also contain the following extras and hang in there with me here theres a lot of them a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors an isolated score track an interactive trivia game an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo and a stuart little readalong story which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you,positive
there are also three music videos and six theatrical trailers called thecatrical trailers,positive
get it,positive
its funny for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases the adventures of elmo in grouchland madeline the nuttiest nutcracker muppets from space and baby geniuses the only bad thing about this entire dvd,positive
i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses,positive
dvdrom features are also on the disc including web links and a demo of the stuart little cdrom game,positive
but wait,positive
theres still more,positive
theres a section called basement treasures where you will find the auditions of the films animators six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director a visual effects gag reel a production gag reel and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene with commentary from the director,positive
the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson,positive
they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the films production,positive
minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski who wrote the people vs larry flynt and ed wood and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel who wrote splash and multiplicity among others,positive
anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur,positive
the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film,positive
movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track serious animation buffs will love the second one,positive
now i know this is slightly off topic but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now,positive
one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called i need to know by a group called r angels,positive
this video features four midteenage girls the singers obviously having a slumber party,positive
the girls ask a ouija board i need to know,positive
who to do who to do who to do as the song begins,positive
they then sneak out of their house and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits,positive
then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like ill be your pleasure all the time,positive
just say the words that youll be mine,positive
um,positive
what the hell,positive
what does this have to do with stuart little,positive
how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd,positive
when the video concludes the words to be continued appear,positive
oh i cant wait to see who theyve slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out,positive
kids wont care about most of the special features on this dvd but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a kid at heart thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them,positive
this is the way to do dvd a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost,positive
the diney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar,positive
a man is not a man without eight taels of gold,positive
starring sammo hung sylvia chang directed by mabel cheung written by cheung and alex law cinematography by bill wong,positive
eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love,positive
neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful but both are good enough,positive
and along the way there is one perfect scene which is one more than you find in most films,positive
slim played by portly sammo hung better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york,positive
when the movie opens we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver,positive
he does not seem particularly out of place,positive
in fact he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years spending most of his life savings in the process and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water as he realizes that you can never go home,positive
he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters cheap sunglasses and lobsters which have to be large to prove theyre american the tokens of his success,positive
he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch because without eight taels of gold a man is not a man my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb,positive
he loses most of this stuffexcept the goldwhen his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride so to speak on a raft along the river which runs past his parents village,positive
when he arrives unannounced he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father,positive
all of this has the makings of a routine comedy and the movie has its amusing moments as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming and they all give him birds so by evenings end he is surrounded by turkeys ducks geese and other sundry fowl,positive
but eight taels is not a comedyit is a sad sweet story about the choices people make and how they are sometimes irreparable,positive
director mabel cheung an autumns tale the soong sisters sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the worldwhat it is like to no longer have a place to call home,positive
slim does not belong in china nor does he belong in america where he can barely speak the language,positive
seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village we come to know the world slim left behind and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time and wishes it felt more like home,positive
the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed i being one was sympathetic,positive
on his way to his parents village slim hooks up with jenny sylvia chang whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed oddsandends which is what he continues to call her although she is now a mature professional attractive woman to be married in the spring to an americanchinese man,positive
slim and oddsandends fall for each other,positive
thats predictable,positive
the manner in which their non romance is played out is not,positive
the emotions involved are adult and complex and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma,positive
its typical for instance that the fianc in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover,positive
but here the fianc is a decent ordinary guy and although slim would like to feel anger he cannot,positive
the fianc has done nothing wrong the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions take your pick,positive
eight taels has its share of flaws the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak but it compensates with insight,positive
when oddsandends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco she notes resignedly its all the same,positive
wherever we go well be in chinatown and her straightforward statement expresses much,positive
there is insight too in the understanding of the consequences of slim and oddsandends decisions he to move to america she to marry a chineseamerican,positive
both their choices were perhaps born of impatience perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greenerand it turns out that both choices were wrong,positive
but they cannot undo them they must live with what they have done,positive
such is life,positive
the movie is tender toward these people but it offers no false comforts,positive
everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene which is the culmination of the love story,positive
slim and oddsandends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly with the muted poppop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss,positive
the exchange that follows and what slim then does is poignant and perfect with clarity and understatement we see two peoples lives their heartbreaks and virtues summed up in a single moment,positive
yes the film is flawed but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies,positive
seen september 5 1998 at 10 p m at the sony nickelodeon theaters boston ma theater 2 with matt perreault for free using my critics pass,positive
theater rating 12 okay seats sound and picture,positive
modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before from teenage sitcoms to nc17rated films about fetishes,positive
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it,positive
your friends and neighbors takes a different approach as its a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends,positive
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is neil labutes basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story,positive
firstly and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex detailed story of lust betrayal arrogance hypocrisy greed and just plain stupidity between six different characters three men three women without hardly any supporting characters a few have a line or two mostly extras,positive
everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come fullcircle back to themselves whether it be positive or negative,positive
but to just state this is arbitrary and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult,positive
labutes ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat but whats specifically impressive is the fact the characters names are never revealed until the end credits roll,positive
for the sake of this review i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic,positive
another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus,positive
were always able to tell where the characters are someones home the gym a restaurant hotel room etc but what the city they live in what year it is what the society is like etc is relatively unknown,positive
the film is a complete character study with the tight intense drama of the theater,positive
no one plot dominates the story which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background,positive
were simply dropped in on the characters lives and are expected to figure out the rest,positive
the characters are a group of middleclass white people who are all successful at what they do but theyre only concern right now seems to be their sex lives,positive
first theres barry eckhart and mary brenneman a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who dont know what theyre problem is,positive
barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife and the sex they have but doesnt have a lot of ambition he just follows everyone else,positive
mary is a writer of some sort but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character but ironically doesnt hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something,positive
labutes script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two,positive
obviously this is the theme which is enhanced by the actors good performances but at the same time seems just a bit hollow,positive
another couple is jerry stiller and terri keener who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time yet they constantly argue over anything and everything,positive
their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship,positive
if only one aspect of the film could use improvement it would be this area,positive
its natural for a married couple to become bored with each other but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together,positive
what did they ever see in the other person to begin with,positive
labute never really answers but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process it still makes for good drama tension and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful its fascinating,positive
two other characters act as catalysts cary jason patric and cheri natassja kinski,positive
cary is an arrogant hostile sexmaniac who defines the word bastard,positive
somehow he is able to bend women to his will either through charm or just attitude into getting his way,positive
hes the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize hes secretly perverted but somehow barry finds comfort in his company although jerry is always nervous around him,positive
patric gives an outstanding performance so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is,positive
cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her,positive
she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different from becoming involved in a relationship with one to brushing it off as small talk with another to being outright appalled by yet another,positive
shes a sweet woman perhaps the most normal of any of the characters and although her symbolism is obvious her role as the outsider is the most relatable,positive
i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others action as thats the hook of the film,positive
the first two acts begin to set up the characters and eachs scenarios but its often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom,positive
the result is sometimes surprising other times predictable but the actual course of actions is always fascinating,positive
for a while everyone has their fun but ultimately each characters guilt attitude or ignorance will disserve them,positive
one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be,positive
since the characters only interact with each other there isnt much pop culture references as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it,positive
are we to assume that these people are as the title states our friends and neighbors,positive
i dont know of anyone going through the same situations as these people,positive
often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie,positive
but what this film does have that the others dont is repercussions in the end,positive
although the film creates its own reality it goes to show that even the immoral arent immortal,positive
in what way your friends and neighbors is supposed to work is open to interpretation,positive
it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically,positive
still its an accomplishment in filmmaking because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective,positive
call it touched by a demon,positive
gregory hoblits fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual horrific twist,positive
if marketed properly this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven,positive
in fact theres even a little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lions share of the weirdness distilled out,positive
remember bob,positive
the biggest failing of fallen is that although its consistently interesting its not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope,positive
a serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him to justice,positive
now during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around,positive
shortly thereafter he begins to sing time is on my side as hes taken on his last walk,positive
minutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead,positive
but for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasnt a normal psychopath he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel,positive
and with reeses death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will,positive
only hobbes and a pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what theyre up against,positive
the rest of the cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini a newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland dont have a clue and as a result they are in mortal danger,positive
as depicted by hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is a dark dreary place a gothic city rather than a modern one,positive
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown,positive
the most famous landmark to appear isnt the liberty bell or independence hall its genos steaks,positive
shadows and night scenes abound,positive
the days are cloudy and unpromising,positive
this is the kind of setting where its easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men,positive
fallens plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized,positive
somehow i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise,positive
but the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check,positive
nevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks,positive
the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual,positive
of the several dozen actors to play azazel the best is by far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives a fantastically charged performance,positive
john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick,positive
sadly however these two are the only ones who excel,positive
everyone else including denzel washington is boring,positive
washingtons flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film,positive
its not that hes bad per se but hes not very interesting,positive
theres no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes,positive
as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his lifeordeath chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was,positive
washingtons subdued approach is part of the reason for this i never felt a sense of urgency,positive
however at least washington was believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindlers list and donald sutherland,positive
to be fair the flaws in their characters arent all actingrelated neither stanton nor gretta milano are wellwritten,positive
that said however theres nothing inspired about either davidtzs or sutherlands work,positive
both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multidimensional individual,positive
narratively fallen has a few glaring weaknesses,positive
although the plot proceeds with a convoluted gamelike structure it uses a denzel washingtonsupplied voiceover to overexplain matters,positive
at times this is actually helpful and it has a use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become a little hard to swallow,positive
in addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel,positive
however despite the negatives im still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending which i loved,positive
the final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected,positive
its not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did,positive
at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself,positive
this is not a great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are its a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours,positive
and whatever you do dont walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll,positive
based on the boris karloffs classic by the same name the mummy starts off with the highpriest of osiris imhotep who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible bandaged up having his tongue removed and being covered in flesheating scarab beetles then entombed all while still alive,positive
recap a few thousand years later where a soldier named rick played by brandan fraser aids a young historian named evelyn played by rachel wiesz and her brother jonathan played by john hannah in finding the book of amon ra in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy,positive
problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress using evelyn as a sacrifice,positive
walking in with relatively low expectations i thought this movie was actually pretty good,positive
the visuals and cgi are astounding and obviously not cheaply done at all,positive
they pack a ton of detail into the images especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi,positive
the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes such as unnerving moments involving flesheating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him after all those who took his artifacts are cursed,positive
unfortunately the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time becoming a tug of war for control between genres,positive
on one hand it is a fast paced action film,positive
on the other its a frightening horror film,positive
and on the side its a hilarious comedy,positive
ideally for it to be successful the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect with one character serving as the comic relief that would be johnson,positive
the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief with rick occasionally delivering his witty oneliner,positive
if they were trying to make a horroractioncomedy it would have helped if it were established early on in the film but unfortunately with the backstory of imhoteps entombment that would be impossible,positive
and then theres the slapstick fight scene between a swordwielding rick and an army of mummies,positive
while really well done it had the feel of slapstick comedy,positive
replace the sword with a chainsaw and youd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness,positive
while entertaining and funny it feels really out of place,positive
but at least its a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of,positive
on the whole the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end entertaining the audience,positive
but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners turn,positive
the sound down,positive
while a lot of theatres have good sound systems my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if youre not careful,positive
when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film end of days it was so loud i couldnt make anything out,positive
the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do,positive
lives are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at a moments notice,positive
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being a police officer he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower,positive
most of all the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants,positive
it takes a pretty smart person to do that,positive
but what if the hostageholding criminal is just as smart,positive
what if hes also able to think on his feet,positive
in fact what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor,positive
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f gary grays the negotiator,positive
in this film police negotiator danny roman samuel l jackson is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force,positive
when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in romans home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder,positive
faced with the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny by the media roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captains office,positive
i dont quite remember if the captain actually said i hate to do this but,positive
although it wouldnt surprise me if he did,positive
luckily the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above,positive
after being offered a takeitorleaveit deal by the district attorney roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum j t,positive
walsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he has been framed,positive
although romans actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational buildup gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue,positive
jackson while a superb actor is miscast in the role of roman,positive
the actor has become so popular and so often identified as a protagonist notable exceptions can be found such as in jackie brown that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats,positive
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence,positive
how can we believe hes going to shoot a hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier,positive
unfortunately this preconception saps the film of some of its wouldbe suspenseful moments and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jacksons acting ability,positive
almost every time hes in a scene jackson steals it without looking back,positive
when spacey appears the film has already run about a third of its course,positive
his is an interesting character,positive
made out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation,positive
i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower but i cant talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says,positive
when he gets the call to action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be,positive
soon his character has to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in a team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiations fail,positive
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor,positive
as the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely,positive
gray really lucked out with this cast,positive
david morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey,positive
the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played a similar role in the rock rifkin played the d a,positive
in l a confidential and spencer played a police detective in cop land,positive
with the level of acting however this can be forgiven,positive
also in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides,positive
his character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even says anything,positive
fortunately this doesnt distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout,positive
j t walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in with one of his final performances,positive
sadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film,positive
walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon,positive
for one of his best performances check out sling blade in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton,positive
when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success the actors performed together in a few good men,positive
the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing,positive
in the end the negotiator has a plotline that parallels its reality,positive
were served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best,positive
as an audience were also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie and wed like to see if one will dominate the film,positive
both provide some pretty good entertainment,positive
desperate measures was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released summer 97,positive
for some reason it was delayed until hollywoods traditional dumping ground january,positive
now that its out i see no real reason for that delay as its a simple yet highly entertaining film,positive
michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer whos bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective garcia,positive
keaton agrees to the transplant only so he can attempt escape,positive
he succeeds in a plan that of course could only work in the movies,positive
the police force is now trying to kill keaton while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son,positive
the film definately has its flaws,positive
the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status,positive
also after keatons escape garcias captain barks at him how many men have to die to save your kids life,positive
which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark,positive
the thing is its a vaild point,positive
how many people have to be needlessly crippled burned and killed just to save this one child,positive
whats the greater good here,positive
many lives or one life,positive
if movies really had guts nowadays i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcias character,positive
place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else,positive
alas movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audiences strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable,positive
despite a few silly moments and one or two really stupid ones the good things about desperate measures outnumber the bad,positive
the main highlight would be keatons performance,positive
the character could have easily been an overacting scene chewing freak but keaton underplays it nicely,positive
hes not as menacing as he was in pacific heights or even as menacing as he was in batman yes kids batman used to be a dark character but you certainly get the idea that hes evil,positive
even the final scene of the film which normally i would just hate seems strangely appropriate for this film,positive
so much so that i didnt mind it in the slightest,positive
and another bonus the film takes place in san francisco which usually means a car chase on those hills that youve seen a billion times before,positive
and for a moment it looked as though it was about to happen,positive
but it doesnt and thats creative,positive
r,positive
footloose has only one goal in mind to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feelgood antics,positive
and i hate to admit it i fell for it,positive
the movie is about a teenager bacon who moves to a small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend lithgow,positive
he ends up falling for the preachers daughter singer and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do,positive
as mentioned at the beginning of this review footloose is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama,positive
there are virtually no surprises and the writing is secondrate,positive
so why did i enjoy it so much,positive
for one thing the cast is great,positive
kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role,positive
were rooting for him right from the start and unlike most films of this genre bacon doesnt play him as the rebel without a clue sort,positive
yes he does rebel but hes also polite when he needs to be,positive
and he never broods,positive
the rest of the cast is equally impressive,positive
john lithgow seen here playing a normal guy for a change is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian,positive
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter,positive
by the end of the film we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character,positive
another nice touch is the music,positive
we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with sexual innuendos but thats not true at all,positive
the title track performed by kenny loggins is upbeat and fun,positive
during the final sequence i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing,positive
of course i soon realized that would be a little pathetic,positive
anyway footloose is a charming little surprise,positive
dont let the premise prevent you from watching it,positive
it sucked me in and itll do the same to you,positive
this is a film about secrets some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley,positive
others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healylouie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work,positive
and still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line,positive
receiving a summer grant to study chemoelectric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their threeyear marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her,positive
he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab which is off limits to her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses,positive
his main argument is that this is what the public wants they dont want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science,positive
that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science science as a business as opposed to the good science science that cares about the small farmer which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming,positive
he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins,positive
the third view in all this is the artists represented by lillian who points out that the artists work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why shouldnt the same be true of the scientist,positive
she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored,positive
geoffrey impatient to get ahead with his research feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on as he contacts one of the companys higher ups to argue his case but decides he cant wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life,positive
while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted by alex and one of his coworkers and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area,positive
in the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the film as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything,positive
the scientists engage in a rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly with davids view but coming at it from a much different angle,positive
it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies,positive
that the directors point of view is absolutely right is beside the point,positive
the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became onedimensional characters,positive
geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster alex vine was likened to his last name the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty,positive
alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alexs apartment,positive
geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him,positive
the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely,positive
the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies,positive
the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails to respond to davids loving gesture for her to stay with him instead opting to head back to the city,positive
the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientists lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higherups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way,positive
what is progress,positive
what can one expect out of life,positive
is the small farmer about to become extinct,positive
the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way,positive
that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart film that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white,positive
no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic,positive
there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me as i dont like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically,positive
that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference,positive
the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high,positive
perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene,positive
it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picassos guernica had for him,positive
both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on,positive
the pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires to raise a family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband all in the name of science had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science,positive
perhaps the most pertinent question the film asks requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married with art,positive
tempe mills cinema azthis movie had us in nonstop stitches from beginning to end,positive
all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie,positive
if you thought they were funny see the rest of the movie,positive
its hilarious,positive
how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized headbopping on snl to exactly one song,positive
easy,positive
write an interesting script around triedandtrue ideas add some good lines and satire and voil you end up with an excellent welldone very entertaining flick,positive
will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day,positive
at night they pursue their lifelong ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills ca the only disco act worth going to,positive
the only problem the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door the roxbury closes all the while bearing witness to guys with onehundreddollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss,positive
the script authors steve koren will ferrell and chris kattan cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury,positive
their flowershop van is rearended by richard grieco who fears a lawsuit and is surprised to see the idiots are too starstruck to think about the car accident they just had but not about getting into the roxbury,positive
grieco happily takes them in even introduces them to the owner which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers elisa donovan and gigi rice who bet their time and bodies on will and chris,positive
what follows are some of the best slapstick dancing routines ever,positive
the music is superb and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandezs born to be alive,positive
the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by for example the bee gees and their stayin alive,positive
it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump,positive
one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will,positive
and chris dont have any mone y and dump both on the spot even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away,positive
an artimitateslife poke at shallow women,positive
its a scene thats an approximate parody of the vinegars own rolf luedekes editorial this week national organization for men nom replaces now,positive
ted unabomber,positive
kaczynski himself rejected for not having money will identify well with this scene if he ever watches the movie,positive
of course the script wouldnt be complicated enough without adding molly shannon the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids and who will has had an aversion to in quest of goodlooking disco blondes proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby,positive
nevertheless wills father wants him to marry molly anyway but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guestquarter exile,positive
during the wedding ceremony wills heart isnt exactly into getting married and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more headbopping music will thinks worse of the knottieing idea and runs to chris,positive
definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony,positive
i found this scene a riot however it went over brandis head she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared,positive
the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries instead the stepin lifter who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy and who has been lusting for a goodlooker for a long time but ready now to take anyone,positive
more artimitateslife stuff not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world,positive
the idiots mother is played by loni anderson whose barbiedoll looks,positive
dont play well anymore shes a bit old and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down,positive
i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in,positive
need of a lot of laughs,positive
go with a date,positive
brandi laughed nonstop as i,positive
did and a deafmute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes,positive
usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock,positive
others will mention meg ryan,positive
but for me its not even close,positive
janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now,positive
and its a good thing shes starring in the matchmaker because without her presence the movie would be bland unfunny and dull,positive
garofalo stars as marcy tizard a top aide to boston senator john mcglory who is suffering in the polls,positive
in an attempt to capture the irish vote he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglorys that never moved to america,positive
unfortunately for marcy her visit coincides with the towns annual matchmaking festival,positive
things get off to a rocky start for marcy though,positive
she has no hotel reservations for no rational reason and the tiny confined room tired old cliche she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub,positive
his name is sean and marcy finds him repugnant at first so you can obviously tell where this is headed,positive
the movie runs into a few roadblocks,positive
for instance the story is very thin,positive
none of the characters except the old local matchmaker are nearly as interesting as garofalo,positive
some of the characters like the political aide played by denis leary have wandered in from a completely different movie,positive
i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery and several closeups of garofalos winning smile,positive
the strange thing is that it works,positive
garofalos charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories and it carries this one,positive

im beginning to get fed up,positive
over my four years as a critic the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films,positive
the good balances the bad,positive
i try to see both in equal proportions,positive
but disneys mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i havent seen a truly terrible movie,positive
its a backwards machismo i suppose the urge to see the things which you so loathe but i need to see a bad film every once in a while,positive
and you know what mighty joe young doesnt qualify,positive
far from being bad mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie,positive
its enjoyable appropriate cute cuddly and all of those other things that ive been seeing in every movie since a bugs life,positive
mighty joe young tracks a 2 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in,positive
california,positive
for safekeeping,positive
okay,positive
a little unrealistic but who ever said a kids movie had to have the slightest hint of realism,positive
the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mistesque hatred of poachers womanofthewild motif,positive
the second half is a straight up parody of king kong awestruck onlookers and all,positive
mark one down,positive
im feeling relaxed,positive
it is as a point of fact an extremely uncreative movie,positive
but as a vetern i can say quite honestly that creativity doesnt count for as much as it should,positive
so that saves mighty joe from my wrath although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment,positive
this is not the film to take a girl on a date to,positive
its not the film for you,positive
its the film for you and your family,positive
when youre right alongside your kid all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away,positive
the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick,positive
it becomes fun,positive
all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch,positive
at first glance three kings looks to be just another war movie the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember,positive
the 90s version it definitely is just another war movie,positive
not in your dreams,positive
imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan thats three kings for you,positive
believe it or not it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter,positive
the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war with the allied troops victorious,positive
majpr archie gates clooney leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox postwar looting spree the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert,positive
as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home this wild bunch goes awol on an armed humvee the vehicle of choice of the us army,positive
they soon find out that they have much resistance as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces,positive
frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men they become consciously attacked by their own morals,positive
as the film begins to roll it seemed to have a rather light mood to it,positive
special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a lighthearted funny action movie,positive
three kings is much smarter than that,positive
as the conflict becomes more and more complex the audience will be trapped in a limbo trying to stay focussed on that light mood that the film seem to portray,positive
i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity,positive
this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant,positive
action sequences are not shot as your oldfashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs inyourface war violence,positive
they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight closeups and pauses right before the action starts,positive
not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style tons of them starring clint eastwood,positive
great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film the screenwriter and the director,positive
three kings ranks among the best films of the year well for me at least,positive
highly recommended,positive
uncompromising french director robert bressons lancelot of the lake achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malorys morte darthur,positive
instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them,positive
chivalry has no place in lancelot of the lake except as that of a dying ideal,positive
bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning decimated after failing merlins command to retrieve the holy grail the mystical cup that was filled with christs blood,positive
bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest bloodshed and failure,positive
the opening sequence is a series of clumsy disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights a head is hacked off a stomach is impaled a skull is split open skeletal remains hang from trees and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house,positive
since the film starts with camelot in nearruin and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion it doesnt carry the grand tragic resonance of other arthurian films,positive
we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power therefore there is no real downfall to witness,positive
but then again it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film,positive
rather it is lancelot and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart than the external downfall of a kingdom,positive
lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh,positive
the greatest of all knights he was flawed only in his love for arthurs wife queen guinevere and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot,positive
even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere laura duke condominas he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment,positive
he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom but he is powerless in his passion,positive
when sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot of the affair other knights including sir gawain humbert balsan spring to lancelots defense,positive
it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table the flesh wins out over the spirit and the consequences are dire,positive
bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of mens hearts and minds,positive
lancelot of the lake is filled with his particular trademarks a strippeddown minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music,positive
he uses background music only twice in the film during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits,positive
the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the films thematic elements the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor the neighing of horses the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest,positive
like most of his other films bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless flat voices,positive
all the actors he used in lancelot of the lake had never acted before and with the exception of patrick bernhard they never acted again,positive
never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word,positive
instead of using vocal inflection bresson strove to create emotion through images,positive
in some ways this technique works in other ways it doesnt,positive
the final montage of arthurs men battling each other is quite marvelous and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrappile sums up the entire film in one moment,positive
however other times bressons uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable,positive
for instance during an important jousting contest bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses legs,positive
he does this repeatedly opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag,positive
while there might be symbolic value in this the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome,positive
nevertheless lancelot of the lake is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker,positive
bressons style may not be for everyone but one has to respect his strength as an artist,positive
by reevaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own he turns lancelot of the lake into something rare in modern cinema a truly personal film,positive
when i first heard that romeo juliet had been updated i shuddered,positive
i thought that yet another of shakespeares classics had been destroyed,positive
fortunately i was wrong,positive
baz luhrman has directed an in your face and visually stunning piece with this film,positive
it revolves around the two rival families who in this version each run multimillion dollar enterprises,positive
these rival are the capulets and the montagues,positive
the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs who despise one another,positive
as the storylines goes romeo montague played by leonardo dicaprio and juliet capulet claire danes meet at a fancy dress party and it is love at first site,positive
i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film the scene in which romeos eyes meet juliets through the fish tank is one of the most memorable,positive
of course they cannot publicly reveal their love for their families are arch enemies,positive
so they marry in secret this is where things begin to go wrong,positive
the story as with all good shakespeare ends in tragedy,positive
the cinematography is spectacular to say the least and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to lay our scene as the film says,positive
there is very little to criticise,positive
the performances are convincing and several of the films younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers,positive
the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever,positive
despite the well known storyline this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience especially the younger generation and this is certainly a great credit to the film,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
on december 20 1996 amidst all the yearend oscar bait releases from the major studios miramaxs genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream,positive
although the teen horror market had been given up for allbutdead in recent years the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping 100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre,positive
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry suddenly everybody was looking for hip inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes,positive
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost,positive
scream director wes craven previously best known as the creator of new lines a nightmare on elm street film series was thrust back into the limelight,positive
and screams rookie scribe kevin williamson burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion,positive
its hard to understate this last point,positive
mr williamson has based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing scream i know what you did last summer from october 1997 and now scream 2 enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame quickly become the most wellknown screenwriter amongst the entertainment weeklyreading box office figurewatching youth culture since well since that quentin tarantino guy whom it is said has also achieved some renown as a director,positive
indeed in a singularly freakish oddity it is the screenwriter mr williamson and not the director that has been receiving the lions share of acclaim for the success of scream and the print advertisements for scream 2s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence while the traditional a film by wes craven drapes the films title in the ads right below it in equal sized font yet reads written by kevin williamson an affirmation of the screenwriters contribution to the project which may be unprecedented,positive
i can envision the board of wga licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of a film by is attained,positive
and much like mr tarantinos screenwriting mr williamsons work is vaguely unconventional incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters,positive
in scream they satirically discussed other horror films here in the sequel the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels,positive
scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood and mr williamsons rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel,positive
while the sequel was planned from the outset a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr williamson sold the screenplay for scream the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived and its only at about the films midway point when it becomes engaging,positive
like its predecessor scream 2 opens with a splashy eyegrabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the films principal narrative this time around were following the exploits of a young couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab a running filmwithinafilm gag where the true life events behind the first film has been turned into a movie,positive
however although it tries hard and has some good ideas the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overlynoisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore where her performance not only convinced me that she could act but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that ive ever seen,positive
there are too many knowing hip popculture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence and the setup isnt nearly as cleverly frightening as screams while the first films preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying the payoff here is almost campily theatrical,positive
flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college where returning characters sidney neve campbell and randy jamie kennedy have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film,positive
the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors singleminded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers courteney cox roars into town to cover the breaking story while everawkward former deputy dewey riley david arquette flies in to protectively guard over sidney,positive
theyre joined by cotton weary liev schreiber who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film his role here is significantly expanded,positive
the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isnt necessary not because so many people have seen the first installment but because this is after all a sequel to a slasher film what do you think happened to these characters in the prior movie,positive
theres a lot of new faces on the scene too sidneys new boyfriend derek jerry oconnell and her new roommate hallie elise neal randys fellow film student mickey timothy olyphant gales newlyassigned nervous cameraman joel duane martin omnipresent local journalist debbie salt laurie metcalf coed cici cooper ms buffy herself sarah michelle gellar and a pair of simpering sorority sisters rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi,positive
any of these characters could be the killer or for that matter could be the next victim,positive
as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay the narrative is once again framed around the increasinglyflimsy premise of a whodunit,positive
one problem that scream didnt have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer,positive
here and to some extent in i know what you did last summer mr williamsons screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery,positive
the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements,positive
it doesnt help matters any that the killers alterego is fairly obvious from the getgo,positive
indeed the finale plays as fullout camp when the villain is finally unmasked frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes,positive
this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations scheming and motivation that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it,positive
while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived the aspect where its headandshoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences,positive
theyre staged much more imaginatively here save for the first postprologue murder which is handled in such a mediocre conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized and are much more fun to watch,positive
its hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck and a catandmouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown,positive
in terms of its characters the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music,positive
their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is wellwritten and theres a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed,positive
on the other hand sidney is pretty dull here,positive
she doesnt have any compelling presence and theres nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that shes the returning heroine,positive
given this and the fact that theres no strong second banana character for sidney elise neals role isnt nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowans shoes its no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film,positive
what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast,positive
the films mounting body count bears out the fact that no character is safe well almost while in principal i applaud this bold policy at some point youve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel,positive
i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular whose casting for the next installment of the series wouldve seemed obvious,positive
but hey as rose mcgowans character said in the first film no please dont kill me mr ghostface i want to be in the sequel,positive
look what that got her,positive
is it just me or have disney films gradually lost their appeal,positive
i was almost stunned by the quality of who framed roger rabbit a fun unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together,positive
the little mermaid harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half of the century,positive
however the endless stream of the little mermaid wannabes is getting to me,positive
you know the spiel a lame plot recycled from some wellknown story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson the comedic the seemingly unattainable love interest a few catchy songs a few injokes for adults and the occasional out of place warnerbrotherscoyotefalloffthecliff type joke,positive
its a formula and like any formula it gets tiresome,positive
thats why im delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli a japanese cartoon studio,positive
from what ive seen of their movies kikis delivery service and the already englishdubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audiences are in for a treat,positive
these movies particularly kikis delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining,positive
kikis delivery service starts with an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecasts of clear skies decides it is time for her to leave home,positive
this is unusual because kiki isnt a college student or a young adult making her start on the world but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch,positive
her mother is also a witch and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance,positive
just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kikis mother acts as a village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom,positive
kiki must choose a city to move to and what she chooses is the costar of the movie a german seaport town far removed from the country life she has been used to,positive
initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding shes discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch,positive
on the verge of leaving for a new town she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it,positive
the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier a onepersons delivery service,positive
this is where the movie becomes shockingly good,positive
kikis job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her,positive
the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesnt seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light,positive
theyre three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of faults and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl,positive
however each one has something about them some interest or trait that makes them interesting and unique,positive
the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely looks impressive capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950s,positive
this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozens are only hinted at,positive
i could probably go on all day but i wont suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie,positive
some of my favorites are kikis relationship with the bakers husband although hes quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scares her his kindness wins her friendship,positive
in the garage of a deliverees house can be found a vintage model t two old ladies have a relationship evolving from masterservant to friendfriend,positive
such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg,positive
added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of selfworth,positive
kiki initially seems to derive much of her selfworth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty,positive
this causes kiki to lose faith in herself,positive
however kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her,positive
seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i dont even want to hint at it,positive
the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and ironically the most disneyesque moment ive ever seen if you dont hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention,positive
the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions there is no violence however cartoonish no songanddance number and kikis pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes,positive
however i would be surprised if disney doesnt give jiji more jokes or at least the voice of some comedian,positive
refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not selfcontradicted a habit disney movies have gotten into,positive
beauty and the beast s beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty was derived from a persons inside and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing,positive
kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her selfimage and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film,positive
another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for kikis delivery service not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be but with a greater attention to realism and detail it fits the movie to a t this is particularly true with scenes of kikis flights,positive
the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film ive ever seen,positive
im not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states,positive
disney tentatively plans a theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer 97 japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that,positive
id guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release,positive
although the wait is unfortunate its good to know that its being released at all for kikis delivery service is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release,positive
watch this movie,positive
along with man bites dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie ive ever seen,positive
moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the postsalary cap era youve got to know how to allocate your resources,positive
every dollar spent on a freeagent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers,positive
in the nfl this leads to teams like the detroit lions who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract but can only field five guys named herb to block for him,positive
in the movies you end up with films like spawn with a huge specialeffects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors,positive
jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking,positive
he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line,positive
watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit except that sanders doesnt have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages,positive
but like the lions star jackie doesnt have anybody to block for him,positive
almost every cent thats invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts and as chan does his own stunts the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills,positive
this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors chan directs scripts and dubbing and supporting characters not to mention the hideous title sequence,positive
this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain,positive
chans first release in this country rumble in the bronx was supposedly set in new york but was filmed in vancouver and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible,positive
heck jackie doesnt even have enough money for a haircut looks like much less a personal hairstylist,positive
in condor chan plays the same character hes always played himself a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen a master of both kungfu and slapstickfu,positive
jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert and is chased by a horde of neonazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs one of the things i like about jackie chan movies no political correctness,positive
he is joined by three women who have little to do except scream jackie save us and misuse firearms,positive
the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere and hes more pathetic than evil,positive
en route we have an extended motorcycle chase scene a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neonazis and two confrontations with savage natives,positive
once at the secret desert base there is a long chopsocky sequence followed by the films centerpiece a windtunnel fight thats even better than the one in,positive
this is where the money was spent on wellchoreographed kungfu sequences on giant kevlar hamster balls on smashedup crates of bananas and on scorpions,positive
ignore the gaping holes in the plot how exactly if the villains legs were broken did he escape from the secret nazi base and why didnt he take the key with him,positive
dont worry about the production values or what exactly the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara,positive
just go see the movie,positive
operation condor has pretentions of being a raiders of the lost ark knockoff but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him with a lawrence kazdan screenplay a john williams score spielberg directing and george lucas producing condor might be an a movie,positive
however youve got to go with what youve got and what youve got in jackie chan is something special a talent that mainstream hollywood should could and ought to utilize,positive
synopsis as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case,positive
if she can survive the demanding s e a l,positive
training she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps,positive
throw in a lot of political machinations sabotage brutality water and sand and you have an entertaining movie,positive
review the title of this movie turned me off at first,positive
i mean gi jane,positive
the other titles which were considered were more promising in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as im concerned,positive
i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor,positive
to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie,positive
moore as lieutenant jordan oneil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men,positive
the storyline is simple,positive
anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless machiavellian politician with an agenda to push,positive
using feminism to achieve political mileage she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s e a l,positive
training,positive
jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all looks brains and strength,positive
the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch,positive
nonetheless its one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless along in endeavours,positive
sure there are the stereotypical elements inhuman treatment sexual innuendo resentful peers pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer,positive
stepping away from the stereotypes though viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer,positive
his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character,positive
jordans boyfriend royce is also in the military,positive
although they both started at the same time due to the fact that he has seen active service he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has,positive
royce what is his surname,positive
do we care,positive
almost resents jordans attempts to advance herself although he quickly settles down to being doeeyed and supportive,positive
his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you dont have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military,positive
in parts this is a very silly movie with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that its hard not to cringe,positive
i still liked it though,positive
weaknesses in the script aside this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood,positive
as we watch jordans battle its increasingly clear that it is a personal battle,positive
this is an individuals fight for selfadvancement,positive
we dont have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings we dont have to feel uncomfortable because were having ideology thrust down our throats,positive
its enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not,positive
meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes twisters,positive
summer is here again,positive
this season could probably be the most ambitious season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact godzilla the xfiles armageddon the truman show all of which has but one main aim to rock the box office,positive
leading the pack this summer is deep impact one of the first few film releases from the spielbergkatzenberggeffens dreamworks production company,positive
following the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases mousehunt and amistad deep impact shines with elements which could just make it one of the biggest movies of the year,positive
deep impact begins with the discovery of an earth bound comet during a school astronomy outing by leo beiderman elijah wood which subsequently stirred up the political community of the world,positive
keeping the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic president beck morgan freeman took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute a highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits earth,positive
while pursuing a sexscandal story amongst the presidential ranks ambitious up and coming reporter jenny lerner tea leoni unfolds the wool that president beck has pulled over the citizens of the world,positive
as if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is not enough jenny has to come to terms with her father maximillian schell leaving the mother for a younger woman 20,positive
president beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the comet exactly oneyear later with so much confidence that it left no trace of panic within the american community,positive
achieving fame from announcement of the comet wolfbeiderman enroute to earth the name of its discoverers leo beiderman continues life in his small town as a young celebrity,positive
a team of astronauts led by the ageing veteran astronaut spurgeon tanner robert duvall was secretly trained to carry out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with a nuclear device with the hope of blowing it out of its current path towards earth,positive
despite him being the most experienced in the team the younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts tanners ability due to his age,positive
but these are just problems of individuals,positive
life on earth goes on as any other day confident that the comet will be destroyed,positive
when the attempt to avert wolfbeidermans path failed and caused the comet to split into two comet wolf and comet beiderman the president unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population leaving the rest to die,positive
citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for 2 years prior to impact when the dust due to the impact around earth have settled by then all life on the surface would have died,positive
jenny and leo were picked but many of their loved ones were not only a handful of earths population will be saved from destruction,positive
20,positive
deep impacts moving moments occur in the least specialeffect laced scenes,positive
while the effects are fantastic they only form a small part of the film which indulges itself in the development of its main characters leo lerner and tanner,positive
leos struggle when he learns that his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved lerners dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mothers loneliness tanners strive to gain the respect he deserves from his crew and his ultimate sacrifice all form the backbone of deep impacts moving moments,positive
deep impact smells suspiciously like the previous year release contact despite vivid differences,positive
i think its probably because they both delve in a story of global proportions and indulges in the premise of hope faith and life itself,positive
both do not depend heavily on eyecandy in the form of cgi effects,positive
director mimi leder who won numerous awards directing television series and made her debut with peacekeeper last year is definitely a director to watch 20,positive
despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer the other being armageddon i think there will be stark differences in the approach to the subject matter,positive
while the premise of both may be the same execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon which is done by the team which brought us bad boys crimson tide and the rock,positive
20,positive
deep impact should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences from the most actioncraving to those who just want to immerse into its manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise,positive
the endurance shackletons legendary antarctic expedition,positive
in 1914 as the great war descended upon europe sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica this time to be the first to cross the icebound continent on foot,positive
28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years,positive
director george butler using film footage and photographs from the historic journey tells their remarkable story in the endurance shackletons legendary antarctic expedition,positive
the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse on foot the vast wasteland of antarctica,positive
as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea the entry to the cold cruel continent they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land,positive
for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed stranding the men on the flow propelling them away from their goal and eventually into their lifeboats for safety,positive
shackleton faced with a desolate situation made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island,positive
once on this safe haven shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization,positive
he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the worlds roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia,positive
miraculously the six land after 17 days at sea on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous snow covered mountains covering 22 miles in just 36 hours,positive
this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen,positive
in the end he is successful and everyone made it back home alive only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war,positive
the title of this fascinating documentary the endurance is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world,positive
it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19months of the toughest most grueling conditions on the face of the earth,positive
the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather,positive
it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men,positive
with astonishing foresight shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey,positive
the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men day to day life the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow,positive
after the sinking of the ship the remaining film stock with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on,positive
considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the worlds harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself,positive
hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary south an interesting companion piece for the endurance,positive
if shackletons original idea document his trek across the frigid southern continent had been successful it would have been considered a super human feat,positive
as you watch the story of the endurance unfold you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent,positive
shackletons amazing 800mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself,positive
there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work though,positive
actor liam neeson narrates the story but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale,positive
the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material both film and photo in the documentarys first half,positive
as the crews adventure takes more drastic paths hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events,positive
helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks but the treasure of the endurance its film footage is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition,positive
i cant think of a truelife adventure that shows better the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds,positive
the endurance based on caroline alexanders book is an eyeopening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and even more remarkably all 28 survivors lived to tell about it,positive
i give it a b,positive
the rocky horror picture show special edition 1975,positive
starring tim curry and susan sarandon,positive
cult films are never mainstream,positive
the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused yelling out what the hell is that,positive
fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the hidden jokes they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like theyre insane,positive
the rocky horror picture show recently rereleased in a special edition to video is the mother of all cult films,positive
period,positive
like some other cult films most notably little shop of horrors the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it,positive
this movie begins out innocently enough a couple get engaged at a friends wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while its raining,positive
they go to a castle to try to use the phone,positive
little do they know that the castle is owned by dr frank n furter a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons,positive
the acting is pretty good overall,positive
tim curry home alone 2 legend is overthetop as frank n furter,positive
its interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandons dead man walking first film she plays janet the girlfriend of brad majors,positive
even the singer meatloaf is in it,positive
the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way,positive
a sampling of titles range from damn it janet to toucha toucha toucha touch me,positive
all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors kind of a bad thing,positive
barry bostwick brad majors tries to sing as does susan sarandon but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience,positive
meatloaf sings like meatloaf,positive
the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version,positive
sadly the songs are tacked after the credits kind of defeats the purpose,positive
if you want to see a different film watch this one,positive
it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k tm,positive
he had never seen any episodes of the show and i have watched a scant few due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes,positive
for those of you not familiar with the premise dr clayton forrester beaulieu wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public,positive
to achieve this he in the words of the tv series theme which is missing in the movie bumped mike nelson nelson on the noggin and then shot him into space and is monitoring nelsons reactions to the movies he is forced to endure,positive
rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions tom servo and crow t robot,positive
the format of the show consists of nelson servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love the ship on which our heroes are marooned,positive
only two things are different in the movie the absence of forresters sidekick tvs frank and the slower pace of the jokes,positive
this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke,positive
for their big screen outing the producers have chosen this island earth a 1954 classic and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill,positive
unfortunately for that film but making it ideal mst3k fodder acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which by todays standards are less than impressive,positive
nelson co make jokes about everything from japans dominance in the world market to star trek to the state of disrepair of seattles kingdome and most of them work,positive
unfortunately the segments set outside the satellites movie theater seem out of place and arent particularly funny but at least theyre fairly short,positive
the big question about this movie though is why,positive
i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen there are no special effects to dazzle you no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat and no use of digital surround sound,positive
so it seems pointless to spend 8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for 3 and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts,positive
nevertheless mst3k tm provides more laughoutloud opportunities than any film youre going to see this year and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse,positive
given its uniqueness i hesitate to grade it against other films but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad bmovies it does well,positive
you know youre in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in questions most normal character,positive
such is the case with the big lebowski joel and ethan coens first venture since their fargo nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods,positive
theres no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment because lebowski is an effort that makes words like strange and unusual seem like an understatement,positive
thanks in part to delicious characterization and an allencompassing sense of humor the film is a smashing success,positive
the central oddball here is the dude jeff bridges an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot drinking beer and going bowling are you college students already rooting for him or what,positive
one night a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet a threatening act thats supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire david huddleston who shares his birth name jeff lebowski with the dude,positive
once the dude realizes this coincidence he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter john goodman a hotheaded vietnam vet and donny buscemi a mildmannered surfer before too long,positive
soon though lebowskis trampy trophy wife bunny tara reid is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom and he turns to the dude for help,positive
it seems bunnys troubles are related to a line of work shes kept secret from her husband shes actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn,positive
the dude now on lebowskis payroll accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself,positive
chaos obviously ensues and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops crooks and lebowskis ultraeccentric artist daughter maude julianne moore,positive
the big lebowski deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that fargo did while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film lebowski is at least as breathtakingly imaginative,positive
the movie boasts a milehigh absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over but thankfully never does,positive
the coens joel directed ethan produced and both wrote keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick,positive
whether were watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeleyesque dream sequence the big lebowski is immensely lively,positive
there are those who will dislike this film but not because its boring,positive
the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material theyre given,positive
bridges exudes a likeable surprisingly sweet presence his dude sure isnt the cleanest guy around but youd still follow him to another movie,positive
goodman merits 1998s first oscar consideration as walters manic temper is one of the big lebowski s many highlights the same goes for moore whose throaty delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot,positive
john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction,positive
sam elliotts rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start,positive
and some will recognize peter stormare fargo s silent heavy as carl hungus a porn star whos really a samurai swordwielding german nihilist and hasbeen pop star,positive
only in its final third does the movie falter with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call,positive
these flaws are forgivable though the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that its hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face,positive
without a doubt the big lebowski is the best film so far this year,positive
sure were only three months in and the competition deep rising desperate measures the wedding singer etc has been pretty bland but its still the gospel truth,positive
maybe during next awards season lebowski wont be a far cry from fargo,positive
a big surprise to me,positive
the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such a dumb idea i really had no hope,positive
they replaced him just fine,positive
not with john goodman he didnt do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing,positive
the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant whos ten,positive
this was another of my fears for the film but hes a really good dancer and plays a mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed,positive
things that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all,positive
im quite pleased that there were less car pileups because they meant less music and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing,positive
theres a few early crashes and then one huge pileup but after that it all stops,positive
its just the music,positive
one of my problems with the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but theres no problems with this,positive
the music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up with the exception of johnny lang who cant sing all the musicians do a great job,positive
the only real problems i had was the special effects,positive
these were superfluous and a waste of money,positive
since the film isnt doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel which i want to see,positive
the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide,positive

theater rating excellent seats sound and picture,positive
critics note this review is the longest ive ever written and still only scratches the surface,positive
id recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis,positive
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of the phantom menace how do i even write this review,positive
never mind the fact that ive been waiting for a new star wars movie since i was seven years old,positive
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released,positive
never mind that theres so much going on in this movie in terms of plot action special effects and longterm story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldnt cover everything,positive
and also like ted does in all of his reviews ill try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you the reader,positive
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered to get the specifics of the film skip this and the next four paragraphs,positive
as has been made obvious for the last several years another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the missing initial three installments of the star wars series the first of the films was actually episode four not one,positive
george lucas the creator of the series has probably just assumed most people know the firstproduced trilogy star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi is actually the second trilogy chronologically,positive
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order but i cant recall his reasons,positive
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy err,positive
second trilogy,positive
well you know what i mean,positive
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which unfortunately may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution,positive
critics note 1 it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule,positive
critics note 2 reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics law of reviewing movies which as roger ebert coined its not what a movie is about but how it is about it,positive
because so many outside factors come into play in the films plot and significance as part of a trilogy and just considering modern society it again would be difficult if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story,positive
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it,positive
we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire,positive
we know obiwan ben kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of the force in attempts to become a jedi knight but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the dark side,positive
we also know something about the force itself that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it the jedi,positive
what we dont know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth,positive
to me this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle definite order to all the complexity,positive
also it seems that were supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended,positive
most notably details regarding the emperor from empire and jedi and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine,positive
for those who havent kept up with all the star wars paraphernalia over the years there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor or his voice at least,positive
with the phantom menace being the first chapter of a long saga one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid including the history behind all the major factors of the series especially the force and the jedi knights,positive
unfortunately this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained,positive
i didnt liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness,positive
if youre going to tell a story from the beginning tell it from the beginning is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes 1 through 3 to clarify the back story even further,positive
but i digress,positive
ive said so much and yet i havent even touched on the specifics of the film itself,positive
all these necessary disclaiming elements should go to show just how vast the story of the star wars series is and this individual film itself,positive
what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three weve come to know and love since the late 1970s,positive
its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality,positive
the basic story is rather sorted complex and even confusing at times,positive
were told that an army known as the trade federation has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo,positive
were not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly,positive
were introduced to two jedi the master quigon jinn neeson and his apprentice obiwan kenobi mcgregor,positive
the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planets queen amidala portman,positive
the leader of the federation an alien called viceroy is following the orders of a strange mythical character an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears,positive
he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance and especially that creepy evil voice of his he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series,positive
sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person,positive
clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity which is never openly revealed in the film but should be clear to most viewers,positive
i have a feeling well delve into his background in the next two films,positive
but it doesnt take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the films story begins to move along,positive
the film doesnt have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one miniplot and adventure on top of another,positive
there are so many of these miniplotswithinplots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook,positive
the other films have relied on this type of storytelling but because of the limits of the technology at the time the films screenplays were also limiting,positive
the sense of limitlessness here is what gives the phantom menace its unique traits,positive
as we already know the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original star wars trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story,positive
and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10yearold anakin skywalker lloyd by quigon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council,positive
to briefly summarize the story jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidalas spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation,positive
their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force,positive
jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force and through another subplot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves,positive
this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before,positive
in fact it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before,positive
the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary,positive
by the films third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot,positive
its funny how the reality of the star wars world seems so embedded in mythology new agelike philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence,positive
not that this technique hasnt been used in movies and in reallife situations countless times throughout history,positive
and at least its all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter,positive
it does border of the cartoonish sometimes but thats just the film appealing to our inner child which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society,positive
the phantom menace delivers exactly what youd expect from a star wars film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness,positive
so many things in the film weve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited,positive
but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies,positive
in december of 1996 a little movie called scream was released became a boxoffice smash and resurrected films targeted at teens,positive
first it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad both scream movies i know what you did last summer urban legend etc but just recently the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre a la 80s john hughes starting with last junes cant hardly wait,positive
it may be the first week of april in 1999 but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25andunder market almost every single week varsity blues jawbreaker cruel intentions simply irresistible the rage carrie 2 and the mod squad,positive
coming april 9 are two more of this type never been kissed and go and on april 23 weve got the teen satire election and the teen horrorcomedy idle hands,positive
jeesh,positive
out of all of these moves however the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation 10 things i hate about you is this past januarys mediocre hohum shes all that,positive
although similar in plotting ok darn near identical 10 things i hate about you a modernday version of shakespeares the taming of the shrew shes all that got its inspiration from pygmalion is an infinitely superior film in every department from the smart direction by firsttime feature director gil junger to the charming and wellwritten screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985s the breakfast club,positive
and to top it all off in the inevitable climax set at the prom at least we didnt have to once again suffer through a goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget or want to remember for that matter this ludicrous development in shes all that,positive
the day wideeyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordonlevitt starts school at seattlebased padua high he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik,positive
although he doesnt know french he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller wont allow her to date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stiles a senior decides to,positive
kat of course has sworn off the likes of boys but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger,positive
complicating matters camerons dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides to use a wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set on bianca as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey,positive
as you can see 10 things i hate about you includes a huge number of characters some of which i havent even mentioned such as kats shakespeareobsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and biancas materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union,positive
at a short but wellused running time of 98 minutes all of the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated as caricatures another flaw of shes all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying youre vapor,positive
since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained,positive
aside from a good screenplay its the performances that can make or break a movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot,positive
aside from joseph gordonlevitt 3rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance to date here none of the actors are that wellknown but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings,positive
as the main character of kat julia stiles last seen in the miniseries the 60s is marvelous and always believable and certainly has a bright future ahead of her,positive
even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hardedged it was easy to identify with kats way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and i completely admired her individuality,positive
no one i think could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does,positive
heath ledger as the infamous badboy of the town injects much life into patrick and has a lot of chemistry with stiles,positive
one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith is able to turn bianca into a person with multidimensions even though she is accurately selfcentered at the onset,positive
in one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has,positive
one offbeat element of the film and a source of some hearty laughs is the way that the schools staff act which is strikingly unformal,positive
allison janney as the guidance counselor ms perky who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite as is daryl chill mitchell as the english teacher who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and at one point sends kat to the office because for once she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good,positive
although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning most of it actually works especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters,positive
in one very funny scene chastity asks i know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed,positive
at another point bianca and kats father a standout larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion before she leaves she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what its like to be pregnant,positive
10 things i hate about you once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the 90s,positive
it also helps that the movie has a perfectlyassembled soundtrack mixing indierock with new wave 80s songs and with thank goodness no rap,positive
by the films end it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and a flawlesslyacted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class this is where the title comes from,positive
luckily i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about 10 things i hate about you but the positive aspects of the film far outnumber ten,positive
as any sociologist will attest your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult,positive
parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives,positive
but if your upbringing is marred with violence hate and dysfunctionality then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome,positive
affliction explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood,positive
the man in question is wade whitehouse nick nolte,positive
here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface,positive
he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me,positive
but as you scratch beneath the surface something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head,positive
we see that he is a meantempered person,positive
he has a hard time taking control of his emotions which usually gets the better of him,positive
he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person but something is sparking a tendency towards violence,positive
he also has tremendous problems with relationships,positive
he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter,positive
but his bearish persona and stature alienates her,positive
he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him,positive
his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl sissy spacek at risk,positive
she tries to remain true to him and supportive but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point,positive
finally he is spiteful and vindictive,positive
as a rejected father he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless,positive
as the towns only police officer he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died,positive
we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain,positive
he is a prisoner and a slave to it,positive
he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension,positive
what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him,positive
we learn that the answer is his father james coburn,positive
this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet,positive
he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist,positive
we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks,positive
to heighten the fathers churlishness the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person,positive
very effective,positive
today wades dad is quite elderly but still manages to instill fear into a grown man,positive
the influence that the father possesses is inescapable and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade,positive
the result is every sons nightmare becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be,positive
this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity,positive
hes a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father,positive
coburn displays heft as the bitter dad,positive
but its most certainly not saturdaynightfriendly fare,positive
theres nothing light or fluffy about this film,positive
that may turn many moviegoers away,positive
but its certainly worth noting that this is a wellacted drama showcasing noltes and coburns raw acting talents,positive
for many people procrastination isnt a problem to overcome its a high art,positive
well do just about anything to put off a task,positive
when the deadline for this column nears its the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and,positive
eventually hopefully sometimes theres a breakthrough and we actually get down to work,positive
amazingly its almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away,positive
and then the next time we do it all again,positive
english professor grady tripp michael douglas is a master,positive
seven years ago his first book was a hit,positive
hes been working on his second a short 200page piece since then,positive
fearful that he cant live up to the first he cant bring himself to finish it,positive
no writers block hes nearing 3 000 pages with no end in sight,positive
now hes having a particularly difficult day,positive
the colleges annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing their books,positive
during the first day his wife has left him his married girlfriend informs him shes pregnant and his agent is in town with a sixfoot transvestite in tow,positive
by the evening our besieged writer is driving though the snowcovered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk,positive
this could be a pivotal point in his midlife crisis,positive
and then theres the next morning,positive
theres a lot to like about this movie,positive
there are no huge explosions shattering glass or computergenerated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues,positive
grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career,positive
in the world of what have you done for me lately he knows his second book has to be better than his first,positive
instead of finding out he drifts comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood,positive
he doesnt have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer tobey maguire,positive
james may be suicidal and psychotic,positive
certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie,positive
he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isnt interesting enough,positive
as the weekend progresses they are both forced to fully engage life,positive
thats the question they must face comfort or real experiences,positive
the film takes some interesting chances,positive
nontraditional relationships are presented as matteroffact,positive
extramarital gay interracial professorstudent here they arent judged merely choices,positive
the actors are all firstrate,positive
douglas triumphs playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled unshaven and clad in a pink womens house robe,positive
maguires disengaged alienation works perfectly here,positive
robert downey jr as gradys agent livens up his scenes,positive
director curtis hanson l a,positive
confidential makes a few missteps,positive
the women are underused,positive
frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara gradys married lover but we never understand much of who she is,positive
the chemistry between the two of them is nonexistent which makes some of the ending unconvincing,positive
katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor but her character goes nowhere,positive
we never even see gradys exiting wife,positive
this is very much a guys film,positive
the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others,positive
gradys alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film not him and sara,positive
as the boomers age expect to see more midlife crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic,positive
eventually itll probably become cliche but right now weve got a winner,positive
ill finish this in a second,positive
right now i have to grab some paint,positive
i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touchup,positive
michael redman has written this column for so long that hes made midlife crisis a career choice,positive
every yearevery year at the festival i wait for that film to come along that one that just pulls me out of my seat sticks its face up next to my nose and roars surprise,positive
into my bewildered visage,positive
its almost always a surprise,positive
it sure as niflheim was this time,positive
amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason,positive
and in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale where we roll our eyes occasionally smirk to ourselves and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a boy i wish that could happen sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash,positive
another e t,positive
another short circuit,positive
this film floored me for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough and presents itself well enough to make it more of an american folk tale with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time,positive
america has always had its mythical heros its paul bunyans and john waynes this film presents us with more general but still universal ideals the honest innocent children who have their own inner wisdom the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage honor and love for their respective sport the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding but has the grit to get things done when they need doin does the latter sound familiar,positive
amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters but it never leaves you with the feeling that its artificial that it stands behind glass or that any sharp breezeor more importantly sharp thoughtwill shatter the wax facade of the panorama,positive
this is a very sturdy scenario,positive
the principals are always given dialogue and always give performancesalways it just blows me away which made them seem real yet enforces their particular mythic role,positive
the david field seems to literally take all the yeah but in real life this would have happen thoughts you get in your head sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading in a stronger way then before,positive
astounding,positive
he uses obstacles to the plot to enforce it,positive
i am truly impressed indeed envious with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay its so very unusual especially in a hollywood film,positive
i dont want to give too much away but the basic premise is that chuck joshua zuehlke the little league pitcher decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons,positive
his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete a boston basketball player alex english amazing grace smith and well im leaving it at that because i wouldnt spoil this film for you for the world,positive
let me just say this though i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply,positive
i dont give a rats ass for the political pointofview this film expresses one way or another im recommending you go see this film because and only because its an excellent story told with excellence,positive
no i dont believe what happens in this film could happen in real life while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted i believe in careful negotiations mutual verification etc screw what i think,positive
the point is this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen,positive
this is the natural and moreall the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion and a much better script to boot,positive
it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhoodand more importantly without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of selfconsciousness,positive
special kudos to both zuehlke a reallife little league pitcher who was picked for the part and english a forward for the denver nuggets for their seamless personification of their characters jamie lee curtis who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazings manager and friend william l peterson in a big change from his role in to live and die in l a as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it and gregory peck as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was and who some numbskulls still probably think he is,positive
casting doogie howser star neil patrick harris as mindreading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of starship troopers a hugely entertaining megabudgeted scifi yarn directed by paul verhoeven whos making quite a recovery from his 1995 gstring epic showgirls,positive
sure starship troopers qualifies as cinematic junk food but thats forgivable when the junk food is this tasty,positive
everyone needs a highcalorie changeofpace from falls onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait and troopers does the job admirably despite its flaws,positive
for its first hour starship troopers plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of saved by the bell and g i,positive
jane,positive
in the distant years ahead high school grad johnny rico casper van dien signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen denise richards he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot so the couple is broken up,positive
but theres temptation awaiting both of them johnnys is in the form of an old friend dina meyer also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor patrick muldoon,positive
personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america killing johnnys parents and destroying his home,positive
our weakening lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens home planet where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good,positive
but the enemy is far smarter more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for and after an initial walloping they must reexamine their strategy,positive
the exposition played like a futuristic soap opera is silly but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans,positive
once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous but never boring training sessions starship troopers really kicks into high gear,positive
its last half is all gruesomely violent action a fury of severed limbs decapitations disembowelments brain removal explosions and other joltinducers that are really going to please the 13 and 14yearold boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly rrated show,positive
the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic imaginative high point,positive
its nice to see intergalactic beasties that arent too derivative of the titular menace from alien,positive
these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights especially the arachnids a spiderscorpioncrab combo thats all sharp talons and even sharper legs,positive
they attack in packs of hundreds and its a funny scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined gooey mess,positive
it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot these sequences of insect warfare are numerous bloody and immensely satisfying,positive
the occasional dramatic moments one cast members death the final resolution to johnnys love triangle are botched a testament to how starship troopers fails to create any strong outstanding characters,positive
these bland kenandbarbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arms length but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la star wars where even the slightest aliens had definite personality,positive
the acting is decent but never spectacular most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory smallish roles on beverly hills 90210 melrose place and it occasionally shows,positive
van dien for example is limited but perfectly likeable,positive
in smaller parts are the aforementioned neil patrick harris as johnnys best friend and jake busey garys son as johnnys sidekick the latter excels at playing creeps see the frighteners or contact but seems offkilter as a second banana,positive
starship troopers is based on the novel by robert heinlein a scifi writer who hasnt exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994s howler the puppet masters,positive
but the overall familiarity to the alien trilogy and the promise of great gobs of gore could act as a crowddrawer,positive
its own possible influence however might well work against it when the franchise continuation alien resurrection opens in a few weeks,positive
we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall,positive
a private matter is based on the true story of sherri finkbine and the events in her life during the 1960s,positive
after becoming pregnant for the fifth time she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child,positive
she and her husband decide with the help of her doctor to have an abortion,positive
but this is the 1960s and abortion is illegal,positive
her doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the law by claiming that the child is endangering the mothers life,positive
everything is about to work out just fine until sherri has the uncontrollable urge to talk about her situation with a local reporter,positive
this sets off a media frenzy and immediately sherri is the most hated woman in the world,positive
she and her husband are fired from their jobs reporters are surrounding their home at all times and most importantly no one in the country and eventually other countries will perform the abortion,positive
this causes emotion problems for all involved,positive
a private matter is a fascinating story and its hard to believe that this only happened 30 years or so ago,positive
its only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation with sherri and any of her opponents,positive
one woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell and when sherri appropriately yells back just tell me what im supposed to do the woman has no answer,positive
no one apparently had an answer they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri and her husband,positive
this is an important film telling an important story,positive
its not just about not wanting another child its about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes in their family none of which could be beneficial,positive
sydney pollack served as executive producer for this made for hbo movie,positive
in the wake of the smashing success of rumble in the bronx its looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release,positive
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii,positive
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc its widescreen and bilinguallysubtitled as are most hong kong films these days,positive
availability over here in the united states is very limited these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng,positive
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read the letters are white and a bit small,positive
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed this review is of the subtitled version so please keep that in mind if youre reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it,positive
to be fair i must admit that ive never been very fond of periodpiece martial arts moviesthe ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past,positive
perhaps its because most of those ive seen were filmed on inferior stock with either butchered dubbing or allbutillegible subtitling or perhaps its because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and in many cases all but nonexistant,positive
in fact many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end,positive
or for that matter it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings armour of god rumble in the bronx etc tend to have more spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts,positive
having said that i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above is one of the better martial arts films ive seen and i quite enjoyed it,positive
surprised,positive
well so was i,positive
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong feihong played by jackie chan who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu,positive
where he learned this style is uncertain as his father wong keiying ti lung is steadfast in his opposition to feihongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu,positive
apparently feihong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan is for americans but ive heard very little about this and could quite well be wrong so ill leave analysis of that to the people who know it better,positive
one of my friends points out that the character of wong feihong is also featured in the once upon a time in china movies but i have not yet seen those,positive
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy as are the plots to many such films but if youre watching a jackie chan film odds are you arent expecting something on the order of war and peace,positive
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics and hence chinas cultural heritage while overworking underpaying and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill,positive
however this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the filmfeihongs perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend supplicate his father keep his pregnant mother played by anita mui from fighting and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs,positive
the macguffin that drives the plot s is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners,positive
in the beginning feihong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicallywrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer,positive
in the process he clashes with another thief who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng,positive
after feihong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies thanks to some timely intervention by a generals son a cameo appearance by andy lau who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when feihong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng,positive
and so it goes,positive
and the plot thickens later on such as when feihongs girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival or when feihong and the thief now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners are attacked en masse another grand kungfu movie tradition but i think ive already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves,positive
lets move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies the,positive
action,positive
theres plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie of,positive
course in a kung fu film thats to be expected,positive
however this isnt just another kung fu movie this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography and jackie chan is a genius,positive
the primary martial arts style featured in the film is drunken boxing a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk,positive
further for the purposes of this film at least drunken boxers fight better when they actually are intoxicated but,positive
theres a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor,positive
under normal circumstances the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid but jackie pulls it off with flair,positive
the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper so ill just say that the fightsespecially the big climactic fight at the endin themselves make the movie worth watching,positive
another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work,positive
even without motor vehicles well not counting a train there are some remarkable stunts in this film,positive
among other things jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals not once but at least twice if you count the outtake shown during the credits,positive
quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database,positive
unlike in american films these stunts are not faked,positive
drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung a better tomorrow 1 2 and anita mui the heroic trio series rumble in the bronx,positive
the performances are firstrate especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film,positive
the scene where feihong and his mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious as is the scene where feihongs mother having just revealed that she is pregnant is threatening to hurt herself in order to draw her husbands anger away from feihong,positive
jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years and hes in fine form all through drunken master ii,positive
as far as cinematography is concerned it certainly works for this film,positive
its nothing spectacular but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s,positive
the picture is crisp and clear,positive
one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that at least in the copy i have the screen was wider than any film ive ever seen on videotape beforealmost a whole 13 of the screen was blocked out above and below,positive
watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can,positive
it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually panandscanned for american video release,positive
drunken master ii shows the full potential of period piece kung fu movies and its good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies,positive
the plot does meander a bit but thats to be expected in this type of film,positive
if you like this kind of movie youll love this movie and if not well give it a chance anyway,positive
if nothing else the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental,positive
youve got mail works alot better than it deserves to,positive
in order to make the film a success all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits,positive
no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in its body its basically a complete reshoot of the shop around the corner only adding a few modern twists,positive
essentially it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking,positive
its overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy not to mention very manipulative,positive
but oh how enjoyable that manipulation is,positive
but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does because i absolutely hated the previous teaming sleepless in seattle,positive
it couldnt have been the directing because both films were helmed by the same woman,positive
i havent quite yet figured out what i liked so much about youve got mail but then again is that really important,positive
if you like something so much why even question it,positive
again the storyline is as cliched as they come,positive
tom hanks plays joe fox the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a familyrun childrens book shop called in a nice homage the shop around the corner,positive
fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business,positive
little do they know they are already in love with each other over the internet only neither party knows the other persons true identity,positive
the rest of the story isnt important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen,positive
sure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship,positive
all of this of course leads up to the predictable climax,positive
but as foreseeable as the ending is its so damn cute and welldone that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does,positive
when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love i was filled with such for lack of a better word happiness that for the first time all year i actually left the theater smiling,positive
when its cold molecules arent moving,positive
everything is clean,positive
these are the essential words of mikey carver elijah wood a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan connecticut in the ice storm,positive
when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikeys life and the lives that surround him,positive
his father jim jamey sheridan is rarely seen and his mother janey sigourney weaver is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood kevin kline,positive
bens wife elena joan allen suspects the affair but doesnt say anything,positive
meanwhile bens 14yearold daughter wendy christina ricci continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy adam hannbyrd into sexual explorations,positive
tobey maguire plays paul hood the 16yearold narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character,positive
we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul,positive
he compares family to the fantastic four comic book and even goes so far as to say that family is everybodys own antimatter something everybody will return to eventually and the farther you go the deeper youll return,positive
the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie,positive
everything parallels everything else,positive
the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs sex and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods,positive
when its cold outside the molecules arent moving,positive
everything is clean,positive
everything is clean because nobody will admit whats going on,positive
even the president is on tv denying his wrongdoings,positive
how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution,positive
all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty and i think thats the point of the film,positive
at first viewing the entire movie might seem empty but then why shouldnt it parallel itself,positive
you dont get to know the characters very deeply but i think thats because nobody in the movie knows each other either,positive
we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another,positive
at first glance you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you havent gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize then you realize that just might be the point and then you do feel the pain,positive
the acting by all is quite good but i particularly liked elijah wood,positive
he doesnt seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being,positive
christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy,positive
still i say hats off remain to wood joan allens subtle but believable performance as a lonely unappreciated wife and the always excellent kevin kline,positive
tobey maguire did a fine job but his character which perhaps was the most intact sensible person in the story seemed a little lost,positive
he was needed but perhaps he shouldve been used more,positive
the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year,positive
i hate to say that i dont agree but i dont,positive
in fact i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one,positive
even so it is a very good film,positive
it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate its art but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didnt before you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story,positive
perhaps this is one to see ponder and then watch again with different eyes,positive
the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane,positive
billy played by michael keaton is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble,positive
christopher lloyd portrays henry an obsessivecompulsive who requires that everything be neat orderly on schedule and by the books,positive
he thinks hes a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports,positive
jack played by peter boyle thinks hes jesus,positive
and finally theres stephen furst as albert a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases,positive
the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the foursome when their psychiatrist dr weitzman takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium,positive
during a pit stop they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan,positive
the movies charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast,positive
the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively they never miss an opportunity to argue bicker or insult one another,positive
henry and jack for example fight over whos going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game,positive
the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other,positive
michael keaton is well cast as billy he gives his cynical character considerable complexity,positive
as the divinely jack peter boyle succeeds in keeping his onedimensional character funny and fresh,positive
although stephen fursts catatonic character is cliched the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing,positive
while keaton boyle and furst are good its christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special,positive
lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance,positive
his body language for example the way he walks and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character,positive
lloyds brilliant performance yields a pathetic moving and memorable character,positive
the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise,positive
the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot,positive
lets face it the 100 millionplus smash that was goldeneye was not a good film by any means and as a bond movie was only marginally better than say a view to a kill or either of the timothy dalton pictures by virtue of nice pacing,positive
but it did revive the series and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ie,positive
the new m is a woman,positive
tomorrow never dies is the picture goldeneye should have been its also the most entertaining bond outing since the spy who loved me,positive
the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine,positive
as an attack occurs the frontpage headline is already being prepared courtesy of carver media,positive
carver pryce the man is a deluded magnate a sort of hybrid of ted turner bill gates and peter sellars german scientist from dr,positive
strangelove physically pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days,positive
its up to james bond to take him down with assistance of course from a wealth of gadgets including a multipurpose cell phone and beautiful women,positive
enter michelle yeoh fresh from supercop as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda with effortless grace she cat burgles dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta and refuses the advances of our philandering hero,positive
they make a great team,positive
tomorrow never dies is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film given that at the helm is none other than the director of turner hooch,positive
spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces each much more intricate and impressive than for instance the tank scene in goldeneye,positive
moreover brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play last time out the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language,positive
returned in brosnans eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tvs remington steele as has his deadpan wit,positive
and though carvers motives are muddy when carver explains that genius is insanity with some success screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut pryce makes an agreeable memorable villain,positive
in the future they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures,positive
there a few too many explosions in tomorrow never dies perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue,positive
and it could have used a sharper script though i was amused by the double entendres none of which i will reveal here,positive
as it stands the plot suffers many holes im not taking about implausibilities and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed,positive
now that the elements are in place modern special effects and stunt work cool pierce brosnan kickass female allies,positive
its time to put them to use in something truly special,positive
theres no mistaking however that tomorrow never dies is ideal holiday escapism and for the first time in perhaps years youll walk out wanting more bond movies,positive
reviewed december 17 1997,positive
i guess there are those who have never been kissed before a rare and dying breed except if youre child in which case it would be called experimenting,positive
rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties,positive
hardest to believe still is that drew barrymore has never been kissed,positive
despite all these hard to believe tit bits there are people out there who have never truly been kissed and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling reassuring them that their search for true love is over,positive
well this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life,positive
and its sweet,positive
drew barrymore who shone in ever after is wonderful as josie grossy the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter,positive
it addresses the issues of how a dweeb becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting,positive
hard to believe but possible,positive
there may also be those who have been kissed before but in fact never truly been given the kiss,positive
so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it,positive
either way it is one enjoyable sit with a fairytale ending,positive
jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh boxsets on the video shelves he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the welloff,positive
maybe its a classic case of displacement its easier to see jarvis own lyrics obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall as a fetishization of lowlife rather than leighs films,positive
but its worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of workingclass characters dont make for a guarantee of authenticity let alone a good film,positive
its the triumph of secrets lies then that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek authenticity and honesty in everyday lives,positive
following her adopted mothers funeral hortense a young black optometrist sets out to find her birth mother and is disturbed to find out that she is white,positive
it is cynthia a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne,positive
cynthias younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages largely because of his wifes animosity towards her,positive
hortense calls up cynthia who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her,positive
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually,positive
cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party which maurice is hosting,positive
secrets lies has a simple enough theme at its heart as one character puts it best to tell the truth isnt it,positive
that way nobody gets hurt,positive
but if the film delivers much more than a trite message its because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us,positive
hence cynthias difficulty with acknowledging first to herself then to others that hortense is her daughter,positive
one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever been with a black man before a longsuppressed memory seizes her,positive
at the party cynthias pretense that hortense is her factory coworker leads her to ever more convoluted lies as agonizing as they are funny,positive
little lies seep into every corner like maurice pretending that hes just dropping by when he visits cynthia after much deliberation,positive
maurices job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme a sadlooking bride that maurice coaxes to smile a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles,positive
one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face she says she needs the photo to look as bad as possible to collect insurance money yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars,positive
there are occasionally hilarious moments as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception ive got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne if youve got it flaunt it is what i say,positive
as played by brenda blethyn cynthia comes close to being a caricature with her nervous somewhat disconnected way of talking,positive
but shes really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her precisely because shes so needy of love perhaps,positive
indeed the whole cast gives warmly rounded detailed performances,positive
the script was developed partly through improvisations and the fusion of cast script and director shows best in the party scene seemingly everyone is talking at the same time and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout,positive
in a very different way but also using a long single shot the scene of hortense and cynthias first meeting in a lonely caf8a achieves a touching intensity all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings,positive
the films climax with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsenesque revelations and everybody hugging each other is the one thing that seems false about this film,positive
however its a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the characters lives,positive
when cynthia says near the end this is the life innit you get the sense that following the cynicism of his last film naked leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all without comforting illusions,positive
the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video,positive
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,positive
pretty good bring a friend,positive
amazing potent stuff,positive
perfection,positive
see it twice,positive
when i saw the trailer for the sixth sense i didnt expect much from it,positive
my snap judgment was that it was a watereddown version of the shining or possibly a lateentry in the glut of angelrelated shows of a couple years ago,positive
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot,positive
it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year,positive
bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe,positive
at the beginning of the movie he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work but he is soon confronted by vincent a patient malcolm failed years earlier donnie wahlbergformer new kidin an impressive cameo,positive
a year passes and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed,positive
cole sear haley joel osment is a withdrawn kid who is called freak by the other boys in the neighborhood,positive
weird things seem to happen around colehis mother olivia williams leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasnt movedand cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldntfor example that there was once a gallows in his school,positive
he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom,positive
the trailer gave away the movies first major plot twist,positive
if it hadnt the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldnt know whats wrong with cole,positive
if youre lucky enough to have not seen the trailer stop reading this review right now and go see the sixth sense,positive
anyway since the trailer gave it away i figure its fair game to discuss here,positive
once malcolm gains coles trust cole reveals his secret he sees ghosts everywhere,positive
dead people wander around not knowing that theyre dead invisible to everyone except cole,positive
malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth,positive
the box office success of the sixth sense has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why thats so,positive
i hate to burst anybodys bubble but the sixth sense isnt really a horror film,positive
at its core the sixth sense is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionallyscarred adult help each other to move past their problems,positive
some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy though,positive
one that really got to me the ghost of a boy says to cole ill show you where my dad keeps his gun when the ghost turns we see the bullet wound in the back of his head,positive
osment gives the best performance ive ever seen from a child actor,positive
its hard enough to find a grownup in hollywood who can give a subtle realistic portrayal,positive
although willis gets top billing cole is really the protagonist of the story and osment truly brings the complex kid to life,positive
if only willis work were as impressive,positive
accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm his most challenging role to date,positive
this is a bad omen for his next movie the story of us which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage,positive
m night shyamalan has a light poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite,positive
hes also a skillful storyteller as the movies ending demonstrates,positive
only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie,positive
look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole,positive
bottom line osment should get an oscar nomination and you should go see this movie,positive
in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see,positive
i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike,positive
but in the case of american beauty i must make an exception,positive
if you havent yet seen it go see it,positive
now,positive
stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex then after youve seen it come back,positive
ill wait here,positive
welcome back,positive
if you followed my advice and i see no reason why you should not have do you,positive
im sure youve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life,positive
american beauty is an extraordinary film a powerful jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream,positive
its humorous but it isnt funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production,positive
mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended and by god it works making it one of the years very best,positive
lester burnham kevin spacey has entered the mother of all midlife crises,positive
he is living life without a purpose,positive
he is bored depressed and sick of his sheltered insignificant existence,positive
he barely ever talks to his family has no sex life is stuck at a deadend job and thinks he has no reason to live,positive
but one day when he and his equally troubled wife annette bening attend one of his daughters thora birch cheerleading performances he sees something that makes him come alive,positive
what he sees is the performance by his daughters friend the head cheerleader,positive
he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature,positive
but for the first time lester feels that he is actually living,positive
this crush is only the beginning,positive
lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life buying the car of his dreams cursing off the boss and quitting his job today i quit my job told the boss to f himself and blackmailed him for 60 000 would you pass the asparagus please,positive
buying drugs from the voyeurnextdoor ricky fitts a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be beauty and refusing to be docile in family affairs,positive
his new attitude further alienates his daughter only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor,positive
and the burnhamss neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum,positive
ricky fitts wes bentley serves as the films thematic center providing the obscure powerful meaning of the title,positive
colonel fitts the father is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie even considering his limited screentime,positive
kevin spacey has never been better and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel,positive
he never plays his droll character as a freak rather he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic selfexploration by his dissatisfaction with life,positive
spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime,positive
equally astonishing is young thora birch who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness,positive
at two hours and ten minutes american beauty didnt feel nearly long enough,positive
its a complicated unforgettable film that like the ice storm two years ago dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life,positive
powerfully and cynically it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream,positive
it claims that this pictureperfect image is just that an image and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it,positive
the dark deeply ironic ending though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie stays with you for weeks after its all over,positive
american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released even more so considering its a masterpiece,positive
synopsis committed to an asylum the marquis de sade rush continues to publish pornographic literature aided by young maid madeleine winslet,positive
abbe coulmier phoenix who runs the hospital disapproves of the stories but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure,positive
de sades craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royercollard michael caine to stop the marquis work permanently,positive
review quills is an exploration of the marquis de sade his madness his cruelty and his perversion his obsession with sex in any form no matter how obscene,positive
but quills also details the marquis determination to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path and to propagate his words to the masses,positive
the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movies most intriguing elements as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates cell to cell,positive
to provide a contrast with the marquis wright involves him with two very different characters,positive
one is the abbe a handsome charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god,positive
the abbe lusts for madeleine but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her,positive
and then there is royercollard a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis motley creations,positive
rush is splendid as de sade utterly inhabiting the character,positive
kaufmans direction is fine and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings,positive
the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly but this is virtually unimportant,positive
for two hours quills acquaints us with the marquis de sade and more frightening still allows us brief insight into his scatological soul,positive
big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america,positive
o j,positive
simpson tom capano the menendez brothers,positive
all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms,positive
and of course courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood,positive
whether it be john grishams thrilling novels or televisions famous dramas the courtroom has always provided big bucks,positive
so when i rented a civil action i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat,positive
however what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected a major surprise but fortunately a pleasant one,positive
john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it,positive
no one expected him to light up the screen in grease nor in saturday night fever,positive
but whenever he gets knocked down he always seems to come back fighting,positive
a civil action is not johns best performance but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998,positive
travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations,positive
his performance is not flashy nor memorable just solid,positive
if he delivered the only solid performance this film would still be average,positive
luckily he has a strong supporting cast,positive
william h macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood,positive
he continues to deliver great performances one after the other but he is still regarded as a secondary actor,positive
in a civil action he delivers yet another great performance as travoltas paranoid and greedy accountant,positive
he is not a lovable character but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film,positive
he is not one of the big time lawyers just a measly accountant,positive
but he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 but there is actually someone better in a civil action,positive
robert duvall is also an underrated actor,positive
he gets many leading roles but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks brad pitt and jim carrey,positive
duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the codefendant,positive
duvall is magical in this role,positive
he is the wise teacher who not only battles it out in the courtroom but also manages to teach every major player a lesson in his own twisted way,positive
in many noncomedic films directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy to keep the audience on their toes,positive
unfortunately they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny jarjar binks anyone,positive
however this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed,positive
this is not the case in a civil action,positive
they have comedy coming from all sides,positive
whether it be duvalls inane questions or macys sharp anger the laughs come in a steady pace,positive
granted its not roll in the aisle funny but it provides a nice addition to the film,positive
the plot is terrific somewhat,positive
the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom,positive
then the case that will make or break jan travolta s career rears its ugly head,positive
they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it,positive
however budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt,positive
i will not spoil the rest although i must speak of the one downside to the film,positive
the courtroom debates are great but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored,positive
it left me somewhat confused although the rest of the film is terrific,positive
all in all john travolta is back yet again in this great film,positive
his supporting cast consisting of macy and duvall turn in tremendous performances which ease the load on travolta,positive
the film is smart witty and thought provoking,positive
not only does it gauge incourt battles but also the various tolls it can take on the major players,positive
a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves,positive
i didnt realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa the motion picture association of america the folks who decide whats g nc 17 pg r or x to ask why the preview was rated r so that we can make some sense of their response let me tell you about the movie itself,positive
the celluloid closet is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades,positive
its brilliant funny naughty and extremely poignant,positive
it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that as a rule gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen,positive
regardless of how veiled or how sordid the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if theyre not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be,positive
the movie itself is rated r and for good reason,positive
it contains scenes of bloody violent gay bashing and graphic uninhibited sex,positive
as with any movie i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend a date my 11 year old niece alone or not at all,positive
but thats the movie,positive
now back to the preview,positive
prior to this film being theatrically released it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times,positive
there was no nudity no violence no bad language nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience okay whoopi goldberg did refer to someone boning someone but the last i knew that wasnt one of the seven words you cant say on tv,positive
except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing,positive
hmmmmm,positive
when i inquired about the rating on the trailer a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from the handbook that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone,positive
hello i was in the office and it was the middle of the day,positive
bravely i pursued,positive
ive seen that trailer oh,positive
probably half a dozen times i gulped,positive
and i dont remember that scene,positive
well she chirped,positive
its there,positive
our little eyes are trained to see that,positive
no really,positive
in the words of dave barry i am not making this up,positive
they are trained to see that,positive
when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her,positive
gosh i certainly dont mean to question the mpaa or the handbook,positive
i would however like to suggest that its they who are in the closet on this one,positive
and the light aint good in there,positive
but having seen the celluloid closet and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study email me and ill give you the details none of this was any big surprise,positive
the point of the movie was that homosexuality even in the politically correct 90s is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society,positive
a point well made in this candid and honest film,positive
now i could go off on the mpaas ruling that a trailer must contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and ask how that is defined particularly in light of some of the things both sexual and nonsexual that ive watched straight people do in trailers,positive
i just dont feel the need to go there because it seems so obvious,positive
ill instead suggest that the mpaa reevaluated their evaluation criteria,positive
let the ratings reflect not subject content like sex and violence,positive
let them reflect attitude content,positive
in the future id be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped,positive
then id truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time,positive
susan grangers review of the closet miramax films,positive
in this hilarious french farce a shy boring accountant daniel auteil named francois pignon discovers hes going to be fired from his job at a condom factory,positive
lonely and distraught he contemplates suicide,positive
but then he runs into belone michel aumont an elderly homosexual neighbor who suggests a sex discrimination lawsuit to intimidate management,positive
as evidence belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leatherclad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignons boss,positive
when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man,positive
his lusty supervisor michele laroque is so intrigued that she wonders if perhaps she could change his sexual preferences,positive
even his exwife alexandra vandernoot and indifferent teenage son stanislas crevillen drop their disdain,positive
but not everyone is enchanted,positive
a mucho macho coworker felix gerard depardieu a selfrighteous homophobe is stunned and repulsed when hes forced by the pr director thierry lhermite to grovel and court pignons friendship or risk losing his own job,positive
francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness veering offtrack only occasionally into pedophilia,positive
daniel auteuil the widow of saintpierre is delightful particularly with a blownup condom perched on his head riding on a float in a gay pride parade and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained and effective performances,positive
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 the closet is a frankly sexual adult 8,positive
its so clever in fact that hollywood is already planning to remake it in english like la cage aux folles,positive
ingredients man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers,positive
synopsis what if you woke up one day and suspected you were not on earth and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers,positive
in dark city john murdoch rufus sewell has this problem,positive
dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery,positive
poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner,positive
a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trenchcoats as well as by the police and the dogged inspector bumstead william hurt,positive
is john a murderer and what can his missing memories tell him,positive
he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues,positive
but when the clues dont fit it doesnt just confuse him it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city,positive
to john something is fishy and very unreal about this city,positive
how come its always dark and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning,positive
and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city or how to get to nearby shell beach,positive
every night around midnight john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation and at this time creepy alien experimenters known as the strangers come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into peoples heads with big hypodermic needles,positive
the strangers have the ability to tune or warp reality using telepathic powers,positive
turns out the city is not on earth at all,positive
and the reason why john doesnt fall victim to the nightly suspended animation is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same godlike realitywarping abilities as the strangers,positive
even with the help of scientist dr daniel schreber can john take back the dark city,positive
opinion director alex proyas he also directed the crow mentions this in the dark city press kit in films science fiction is always used to have big spaceships blow up cities,positive
i think were a little tired of that,positive
according to director proyas probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers,positive
its designed so that you can watch the film over again and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch,positive
its a philosophical piece,positive
cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens whether they be klingons giant bugs or proponents of the dark side of the force,positive
but science fiction in books reaches beyond the shootemup level and targets the big questions questions like who are we,positive
what is the human condition,positive
what is ethical,positive
what would a true human being do,positive
far from comic book style on the order of spawn batman or the mutant ninja turtles dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner,positive
dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay,positive
a little more than 200 years ago the world was filled with unhappy peasants unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian military conformist medieval regimes,positive
the people took refuge in religion the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering but after death heaven would be available,positive
meanwhile the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven,positive
when science finally overturned religion the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments,positive
but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old,positive
this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud kant kafka nietzsche and dostoevsky pondered what society should be and what place the individual had in it,positive
the existentialists in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile indifferent or alienated universe,positive
in dark city when the last dying defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens scientific experiments on the human beings brains failed murdoch replies pointing to his head because the human condition isnt located in here,positive
with three pre to midteen children and an aging fatherinlaw to care forcooking and cleaning and laundry dropoffs at little league practice and pickups from ballet practicemargaret halls life is rife with complications,positive
and with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic virtually impossible to reach by telephone margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent,positive
but margarets hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated,positive
her teenage son beau a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan universitys music program has fallen in with the wrong crowd,positive
his mother drives from their idyllic lakeside community of tahoe city california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno nevada with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neonlit nightclubs to confront the 30something man who has befriended beau,positive
stay away from my son margaret warns darby reese,positive
her words however appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening urging beau to join him in the boathouse,positive
there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house passed his startled mother as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight,positive
the next day on her morning walk margaret discovers reeses lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline a boat anchor impaled in his chest,positive
with her maternal instincts working overtime margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake weighs it down and dumps it overboard,positive
but margarets life is about to get a lot more complicated,positive
soon after the body is discovered snagged on a local fishermans line margaret is paid a visit by an attractiveseeming blackmailer in a red nova,positive
alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with 50 000 by 4 oclock the next day,positive
but margarets life is about to get a lot more complicated for alek turns out to be something she never expected,positive
based on elisabeth sanxay holdings novel the blank wall the deep end is a wellcrafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel suture,positive
it makes the most of a talented but not particularly wellknown castgoran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese,positive
the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score courtesy peter nashel,positive
but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton,positive
swinton whose palefaced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarmans films caravaggio edward ii the last of england plays margaret hall in the deep end and like charlotte rampling in this years under the sand turns in a commanding and accomplished performance,positive
margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves and swinton captures every frustration every fear every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being,positive
the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities,positive
many can relate to that of course its the murder coverup and the blackmail and the fear of losing ones son that swinton so gracefully so graciously makes resonate with the truest of colors,positive
the end is deep all right and there isnt a single shallow moment in tilda swintons canon,positive
when i initially set out to review this film my tag line was going to be you too can believe whales can fly,positive
then it was going to be you too can believe pastel triangles can fly,positive
then it was going to be you too can believe wood sprites can fly,positive
finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say,positive
theres a lot of flying going on in this film,positive
as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in,positive
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released,positive
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 grossing somewhere close to 110 000 in its original month of release,positive
subsequent rereleases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved and rightfully deserved,positive
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before six stories high,positive
in an exclusive four month engagement from january 1st to april 30th 2000 fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us,positive
after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theaters,positive
is the format effective for the film,positive
with a few exceptions yes,positive
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethovens fifth symphony,positive
its hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily,positive
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts,positive
eventually shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns to the butterfly things,positive
though this segment isnt very story driven some of the images are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things who are all outlined in blood red colors begin to overtake the skies,positive
the next segment is set to ottorino respighis the pines of rome,positive
in this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape,positive
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack,positive
he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the oceans of clouds,positive
again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whales are involved,positive
reportedly the whales as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences are shown as actual size,positive
the cgi whales look incredibly lifelike except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images,positive
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent,positive
absolutely beautiful stuff,positive
the third segment and the least of the eight segments is set to george gershwins rhapsody in blue,positive
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york,positive
theres a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having a job a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife,positive
i wont go into how everything works out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending,positive
unfortunately the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments,positive
segment four is set to dmitri shostakovichs piano concerto no 2 and is an animated version of hans christian andersens the steadfast tin soldier,positive
a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a windup clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he cant see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jackinthebox jester,positive
the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina,positive
little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from,positive
the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl,positive
although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short,positive
some children may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made,positive
segment five is the funniest of the bunch,positive
set to camille saintsaens the carnival of the animals this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yoyo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number,positive
while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy,positive
segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia and its the one that people remember most the sorcerers apprentice,positive
the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo,positive
unfortunately the segment wasnt made to be presented on large format film considering it was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts of grain,positive
there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain,positive
similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many 18plus screen theaters,positive
segment seven is set to sir edward elgars pomp and circumstance march no 1 and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character,positive
donald duck stars as an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark,positive
during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didnt make it on the boat,positive
they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners,positive
despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tearjerkers foisted on audiences these days,positive
powerful stuff,positive
segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last,positive
set to igor stravinskys the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape,positive
trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation,positive
when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird,positive
in a stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path including everything that the sprite has worked to create,positive
some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film,positive
the host segments are largely no pun intended throwaways although steve martins clip is pretty funny,positive
be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin,positive
penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting,positive
the best segment comes from of all people bette midler who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board,positive
pieces like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horsemen set to wagners ride of the valkyries and a strange segment prepared in the 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments,positive
for fans of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon,positive
the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material,positive
as i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters,positive
i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though,positive
then you too can believe that can fly,positive
g,positive
i have to admit that i disliked this film initially,positive
it certianly isnt for every taste and its sheer torture to sit through if youre in a restless mood,positive
that said if you are in the right mood its absolutely incredible,positive
this was my second favorite movie of 1998 and would have been a shooin for first in almost any other year,positive
perhaps the big turnoff for many was this films unconventionality,positive
id be hardpressed to compare it to any other film that ive seen it is very very artsy incredibly slow and amazingly it works beautifully,positive
on my second viewing i realized that the film follows the three act structure i didnt think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it,positive
the first act serves to set up the characters sort of,positive
it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness and perhaps even feelings of boredom,positive
and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second which encompasses most of the movie,positive
the majority of the film is one extended battle scene intercut with brief flashbacks and voiceovers,positive
the artsier elements do not detract from the action but add to it they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes,positive
the battle scenes are amazing second only to saving private ryan in my opinion,positive
theyre brutal horrifying and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography,positive
the second act is as immersive brilliant and haunting as any film that i have ever seen,positive
the only problems come during the first and third acts,positive
malick takes a little too long to get the film started,positive
although the initial scenes which consist of two soldiers experiencing a nearedenlike paradise while going awol and the preperations for battle are effective and necessary hints of pretentiousness sink in,positive
the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this,positive
the final act is effective at winding the film down but the problems from the first persist its a bit too long and comes over as pretentious at times,positive
that said there are two sequences one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife and another where one of the main characters is killed that are nothing short of incredible,positive
the performances are phenominal all around,positive
the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel both of whom should have been nominated for oscars,positive
nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation,positive
his character is hard mean and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him,positive
caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war his place in it and if theres any deeper meaning to the hell that hes going through,positive
he is absolutely perfect genuine sympathetic sincere and yet strong when he needs to be,positive
although restricted to a relatively small role sean penn is also very good as the companys pessimistic seargent,positive
as to how it stacks up to saving private ryan it was my second favorite movie of 1998 ryan was my first,positive
its really hard to compare the two they are so so different so i wont beyond saying that spielbergs film had more of an impact on me,positive
however the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality i can easily see why someone would the thin red line above ryan,positive
i highly recommend both of them and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made,positive
all in all the thin red line is filmmaking of an incredibly high order,positive
its slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right,positive
its a real shame that it tanked at the box office films this unconventional powerful and thoughtprovoking dont come along very often,positive
eyes wide shut isnt the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubricks final film but it is an impressive achievement a mesmerizing haunting adult psychodrama about marriage fidelity and sex,positive
its a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end consistently exhibiting the auteurs trademark penchant for long continuous takes his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast indeed eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot kubrick a renowned perfectionist reportedly held his cast hostage on the set for nearly a year,positive
in an uncharacteristic maneuver kubrick cast two bigname stars in the lead roles namely reallife husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman,positive
they play bill and alice harford a volatile couple who during the course of a couple nights ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other,positive
he is an m d shes unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party,positive
at the affair they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else,positive
when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman after smoking a dash of weed inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night,positive
he truthfully says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with,positive
they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story evidently some time ago she had a thing for a young naval officer,positive
she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night,positive
bill is jolted by alices story and we anticipate his reaction but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go show his face at the house of a justdeceased patient,positive
this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town,positive
the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down,positive
he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street,positive
then through a series of coincidences he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic and frankly creepy orgy takes place with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other,positive
erotic dread mounts as cruise whos not supposed to be there wonders the spacious halls watching the action until he is discovered to be an outsider,positive
much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros digitally edited the orgy scene,positive
with the help of a computer they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts they can still be seen just not in all their glory in order to avoid the dreaded nc17 rating,positive
european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it,positive
roger ebert calls the american version the austin powers version and many others have bashed the alterations,positive
i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scenes mystical atmosphere,positive
the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks,positive
this is an artful distinctively gorgeous production shot in dark moody hues and featuring some elaborate beautiful scenery,positive
from the giant mansion used in the films centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harfords apartment this film is always a pleasure to look at,positive
to boot a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still,positive
at the core behind the graphic controversial content and unappealing mood this is a goodnatured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity,positive
it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic,positive
its something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship,positive
at the end it seems bills eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york,positive
kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman,positive
tom is completely convincing as dr harford a man who seems guided solely by destiny with no control of the course his life will take,positive
nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective shes headed for an oscar nod,positive
the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast at the head of which is directorcumthespian sidney pollock enigmatic and articulate as harfords mysterious friend,positive
eyes wide shut is not perfect the last hour could have used a slightly more scissorhappy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander,positive
still this is an important work from a great director and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubricks best it is a worthy final film a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness,positive
1999 eugene novikov137,positive
lisa cholodenkos high art is an intelligent quiet drama,positive
its strongest quality aside from the topnotch central performances is the perceptive way in which the film also written by cholodenko observes its characters,positive
they are all flawed people some more troubled than others but they are not judged,positive
judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers parts because no one no matter how bad off they are deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of,positive
syd radha mitchell a 24yearold woman living with her longtime boyfriend james gabriel mann has recently been awarded an ideal job at the highprofile photography magazine frame,positive
she very much enjoys where her career is headed but is often not taken very seriously by her managers who are always giving her petty jobs to do when she knows she could be doing more important things,positive
one night while taking a bath syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers so when she goes up there to inform them of it she meets lucy beliner ally sheedy a thin wornout and unhappy woman who lives with her drugaddicted german girlfriend greta patricia clarkson a pathetic former actress who is usually so outofit that she often is in and out of conciousness,positive
syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before,positive
lucy claims she doesnt want to get back into the profession but syd manages to convince the frame editors to do a piece on her work,positive
all the while syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons,positive
high art is such an effective motion picture because it is never sugercoated or idealized but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere while syds luck begins to rise,positive
the film in no way is about lesbianism but about love which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality,positive
as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other even if the relationship might be doomed,positive
with this picture ally sheedys star has risen once again thanks to her touching nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy a woman who in the course of a decade has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs which has taken away her onceblossoming career,positive
her characted really is tragic and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem and her mother matteroffactly responds by saying she cant help her is heartbreaking,positive
although not autobiographical sheedy has had drug problems in her past and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucys footsteps to her role,positive
also very good is radha mitchell as syd who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy love and other catastrophes wh caught me by surprise with her performance,positive
easily being able to pass as christina riccis older sister mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently,positive
as accurate as almost every detail is in high art i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james who played by gabriel mann is left with a throwaway role,positive
by the time he finds out about syd and lucy he disappears from the film and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other,positive
this is a very minor fault however in a film that is full of riches,positive
although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems,positive
the character of dominique anh duong the frame editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas was also written to be far more mature than expected,positive
and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done,positive
for once it did not invlove steaminess or violent sexual activity or gratuitous nudity but focused on the actual characters who love each other and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex,positive
high art which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko as well as sheedys strongest and best role to date,positive
the faculty the heavilyhyped and advertised sci film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez 1995s desperado and 1996s from dusk till dawn and screenwriter kevin williamson 1996s scream and 1997s scream 2 is being called a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and the breakfast club and i dont think i could describe it any better than that,positive
the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common and then the sciencefiction aspect is added involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town,positive
the six characters as in the breakfast club can be easily labeled as a stereotype but as they are developed they become far more complex casey elijah wood the much picked upon nerd stokely clea duvall a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her zeke josh hartnett a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz stan shawn hatosy the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics delilah jordanna brewster the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist and marybeth laura harris the sweet n southern new girl in town,positive
although the characters are only slightly connected i e,positive
casey is delilahs photojournalist assistant marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely since they both dont have friends etc when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences the only people they can count on for help is each other even though they arent really even sure if they can trust one another,positive
the faculty is another smart and popculturally hip film from williamson although it does not equal up to his best film the original scream and rodriguez whose from dusk till dawn is still one of the more original genre films of the 90s,positive
williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions respectively that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a nobrainer,positive
the plotline of the faculty involving aliens taking over other peoples bodies has been done quite a lot before from invasion of the body snatchers to the puppet masters to invaders from mars so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh and by setting the goingson at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens they were mostly successful,positive
surely the conventions of the story are still the same and the climax was inevitable but there were a few surprises along the way including the question of who were the aliens and who werent,positive
the epilogue was also a refreshing changeofpace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better,positive
the performances in the faculty were a treat throughout since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do,positive
one exception were the teens who aside from elijah wood are not very wellknown but they all aquit themselves nicely particularly wood the seasoned pro clea duvall and jordanna brewster,positive
as members of the faculty robert patrick t2 judgement day was creepy as the gym coach piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien and salma hayek as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold was very funny in a small role,positive
the standout in my opinion of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who after turning into an alien becomes the sex bombshell,positive
if there was any problem i had with the faculty it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence,positive
since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the queen alien many of the faculty members disappear,positive
it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers although the finale is still pretty impressive and includes some showstopping creature effects especially for a relatively low 15milliondollar budget,positive
although not one of the best horror or sciencefiction films i have seen the faculty is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released,positive
while the story is as old as the hills it is also in a way timeless because everyone i think has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right as if they really werent human,positive
and by putting this idea in the setting of a smalltown high school it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers,positive
note the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading as it features r b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters,positive
in actuality he only has a small role as one of stans buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team,positive
if i were one of the heads from dimension i would change this advertising at once since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving,positive
a standoff,positive
a man holds a woman a diplomats daughter hostage in his embrace a gun pressed to her head,positive
a cop impaired by drink due to his wifes philandering trains his gun on the mans nether regions threatening to shoot,positive
another cop holds his gun to his partners temple forcing him to disarm,positive
the scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridgeupping the ante signaling tacitly going for game,positive
the second cop retrieves the first cops weapon the suspect lowers his and the woman caught in the middle movesin slow motionto safety,positive
it is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move grabbing for the assailants gun,positive
the room turns upside down a shot rings out a cop is down,positive
shot in the back and paralyzed for life,positive
the young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didnt commit,positive
storytelling has always been one of pedro almod vars greatest gifts and in live flesh he gives us a twisting turning compelling tale peppered with wellwritten colorful characters,positive
characters who find themselves more often than not in carefullyconstructed scenes like these,positive
characters played by actors we might not know but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless,positive
take the ruggedly handsome victor plaza liberto rabal for instance,positive
before he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod var favorite antonio banderas,positive
when we first meet elena francesca neri the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis,positive
elenas husband david javier bardem is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmers bemused expression throughout,positive
playing the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos sancho and angela molinano lookalikes spring to mind but they round out the excellent cast,positive
its a credit to almod vars craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity,positive
live flesh begins and ends with a live birth and the films contradictions come almost as often as the contractions,positive
between the two childbearings coincidence irony and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film,positive
although based on a ruth rendell story live flesh is brimming with the acclaimed spanish directors highheeled flourishes,positive
women are at times alluring and repulsive their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricatelywoven drama an eye bruised by an abusive husband here a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there,positive
while in prison victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as guardians of a sick flock,positive
victors prefab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo,positive
dear son i got cancer his mother writes to him in jail,positive
she dies before he is released and its at the cemetery that victor is reacquainted with elenaredemption ultimately substituting for revenge,positive
i rented this movie with very high hopes,positive
this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 and unfortunately was not as good as i hoped but was still very intriguing and thought provoking,positive
first of all the casting for this film is great,positive
tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood,positive
they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly,positive
with a plot as unbelievable as this film you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast,positive
tobey and reese bud and mary sue parker play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability,positive
william h macy an actor i have grown to love over the past year turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife a colored person and his friends the noncolored ones,positive
he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife,positive
he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood,positive
joan allen is equally great as betty parker the ideal tv mom,positive
her character is the most ambitious,positive
she is very na ve and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that,positive
her lack of chemistry with macy which the role calls for and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast then this film would even been even better,positive
as said before jeff daniels gives a bad performance,positive
his character displays the change going on throughout the town yet he does not display it with enough conviction,positive
his character is very confusing and he is not very believable,positive
this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance,positive
the movie is very provocative,positive
it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today,positive
i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing,positive
they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch but do it in a slow pace,positive
the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length,positive
some films are not meant to be that long,positive
pleasantville is one of those films,positive
this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it,positive
first they are amazed by the implementation of color,positive
then they want to have it,positive
then they do not want to,positive
then the war ensues between the colored and noncolored,positive
this is all strung out over two hours which was way too long,positive
some movies need a lot of time,positive
saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time,positive
this film is only two hours long and seems much longer,positive
length is everything in films,positive
if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace you can win half the battle,positive
pleasantville can move at a good pace at times but it is not consistent enough,positive
overall pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days,positive
i went in expecting a lighthearted film about change,positive
i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change,positive
luckily pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences,positive
only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time,positive
who would have thought,positive
jim carrey does drama,positive
when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show i thought what a hilarious idea for a movie,positive
however it was an even better premise for a drama,positive
the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man,positive
that man is truman burbank jim carrey,positive
truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly cristof wants to keep it that way,positive
christof is the god of this madeup world,positive
he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles,positive
there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world but they failed and life went on as normal,positive
the opening parts of the film introduce to trumans world,positive
we see what he is doing at his current age then we get a flashback at his past,positive
it may seem a tad boring but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start,positive
the film can be described in one word weird,positive
it seems like such a simple idea yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of but andrew niccol did,positive
it seems like a warped idea but it is andrews idea and he did wonders with it,positive
jim carrey actually lived up to the hype,positive
the hype whether good or bad always focused on carreys ability to do drama,positive
no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be the only thing they doubted was carrey,positive
and he showed them all up,positive
jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars,positive
i do not think he was the best actor but he deserved the nomination,positive
he plays truman burbank the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world,positive
he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years but then strange things start happening,positive
he ventures into the wrong elevator,positive
a light crashes in front of him,positive
his father comes back and is then pulled away,positive
we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show but truman does not,positive
and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish,positive
carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama,positive
laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife,positive
she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point,positive
peter weir does not make the cast perfect and their flaws eventually lead to trumans escape,positive
the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down,positive
despite carreys greatness the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris who plays the god of trumans world,positive
he displays the pressure he is under the world he has created,positive
he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life,positive
the action moves at a good pace and rarely gets sluggish,positive
but the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show,positive
it really makes you think,positive
maybe your brother is an actor maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show,positive
some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking,positive
or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for trumans arrival,positive
and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon noah emmerich delivers his dramatic line,positive
all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative,positive
i was not only enjoying the film i was overwhelmed by genius of it,positive
overall the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood,positive
jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best,positive
andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection,positive
the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film,positive
synopsis leonard shelby pearce is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife,positive
leonard has only a few clues to the murderers identity to make matters worse he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of shortterm memories meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier,positive
because of this leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself,positive
memento traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination,positive
review memento is the sort of movie i wish id written i can think of no higher praise than that,positive
i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant involved original movie as this,positive
an instant film noir classic memento is virtually flawless,positive
the script is unlike any i have ever seen a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity,positive
although the idea of starting at the conclusion of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the start is not entirely new never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence,positive
memento is endlessly exciting and inventive a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre,positive
and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively,positive
nolans direction is equally effective never losing its crispness and clarity despite memento s challenging gimmick,positive
and to top everything off all the performances rise to the occasion,positive
pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie and pantolianos teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality,positive
memento may be the years best screenplay and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001,positive
anyone who saw alan rickmans finelyrealized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actorturneddirector is a bit of a poet at heart,positive
however for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood prince of thieves this recognition may be something of a shock,positive
nevertheless poetic is an excellent term to describe rickmans feature debut as a director the winter guest,positive
the film has a simple unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole,positive
the result is an occasionally haunting sometimes magical and always insightful human drama,positive
the winter guest isnt about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line its about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages,positive
the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure there is no real beginning or end,positive
instead we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans,positive
they represent both sexes multiple generations and a variety of relationships male and female young middleaged and elderly friends wouldbe lovers and kin,positive
we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed emotional boundaries eroded and truths unveiled,positive
there is comedy and tragedy,positive
most importantly much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives in this fiction can be found much truth,positive
the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year,positive
its so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over,positive
the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach giving the terrain an alien appearance,positive
it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured,positive
there are four pairings and although there is some interaction between the different twosomes the winter guests focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship,positive
the first meatiest pairing is that of elspeth phylida law and her recentlywidowed daughter frances emma thompson,positive
these two have a stormy relationship,positive
they love each other deeply but both are stubborn and willful and neither is willing to admit that they need the other,positive
much of their interaction is argumentative but during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other,positive
frances adult son alex gary hollywood is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father,positive
on this day he meets a girl nita arlene cockburn who has secretly been spying on him for weeks,positive
although their first encounter is antagonistic she throws a snowball at him both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction,positive
once they retire to a place where they can be alone however things dont go exactly as planned,positive
lily sheila reid and chloe sandra voe are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees,positive
death is a topic of endless fascination for them perhaps because they are so close to it and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area,positive
it doesnt matter whether or not they knew the deceased,positive
its the ceremony that theyre interested in,positive
sam douglas murphy and tom sean biggerstaff a pair of schoolboy chums are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach horsing around building a small fire for warmth and walking on the frozen water,positive
unlike lily and chloe these two have their entire lives ahead of them,positive
they are young enough to still believe in magic but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience,positive
the acting is strong and believable,positive
the mixture of veteran performers and firsttimers is effective with the most successful choice being the casting of reallife mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles,positive
there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different nonrelated actors,positive
and of course the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child,positive
the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 with rickman as the director,positive
four of the films principals phylida law arlene cockburn sheila reid and sandra voe appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film,positive
unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays the winter guest has been successfully opened up,positive
the rough bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans,positive
in fact considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickmans microscope it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie,positive
if you appreciate character studies the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater,positive
the muppet movie is the first and the best movie among the evergrowing list of muppet movies,positive
the muppet movie tells the story of how our hero kermit the frog came to be a star,positive
a delightful movie for all ages the muppet movie is bursting with cameo appearances by countless hollywood stars of the 80s and today,positive
the muppet movie begins in a movie theater where all of the muppet stars are anxiously awaiting the first showing,positive
once everyone is settled down the movie inside of the movie begins,positive
it starts out with kermit in a swamp playing his banjo and singing this shot required jim henson to spend hours underwater,positive
kermit is discovered by bernie a bigtime hollywood agent who happens upon kermit by accident,positive
bernie believes that kermit holds much potential to become a big star in hollywood,positive
kermit ponders the idea of becoming a big movie star where he could make millions of people happy,positive
kermit decides to leave his swamp and make the trip out to hollywood,positive
along the way kermit befriends his now famous muppet companions beginning with fozzie bear who had been spending his days doing standup comedy at the el sleezo cafe owned by james coburn,positive
the two decide to teamup and continue on their way to hollywood,positive
but doc hopper charles durning the owner of a chain of french fried frog leg restaurants has a different idea,positive
he wants kermit to be his spokesman but kermit is humiliated at the idea and spends the movie avoiding him and his assistants,positive
the trip continues with kermit and fozzie meeting miss piggy rowlf gonzo the electric mayhem band and more muppets who all share the same wish to make it to hollywood,positive
oh and even more celebrities continue to appear,positive
kermit and miss piggy continue to get to know each other a little better including a rather funny scene at a restaurant with steve martin as the waiter,positive
eventually kermit and the group make it to hollywood,positive
that is after kermit is finally able to elude doc hopper and proclaim his freedom,positive
lord lew a bigtime hollywood producer portrayed by orson welles gives kermit his shot at stardom and gives him the goahead to produce a movie,positive
the muppet movie is definitely a movie that is fun for all ages,positive
it is also a suredeal as one parents can watch and enjoy along with their kids,positive
when i first heard about scream in 1996 i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies,positive
from the master of the horror himself wes craven it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them by making the teenagers do what they know theyre not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them dont run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door never say ill be right back etc,positive
when i first heard this description i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie,positive
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies,positive
was this wes cravens remedy from making real bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn,positive
it just seemed cheap to me,positive
then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes involving drew barrymore and a nailbitingly intense phone conversation completely changed my attitude,positive
scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick its also a pretty scary movie,positive
if youve seen a million of these kinds of films you know exactly what is going to happen,positive
this is part of the fun of watching scream,positive
the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent attractive teenagers,positive
to those who rarely see these types of movies scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film,positive
theres nothing wrong with that misjudgment though,positive
i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience the newbies to horror and the fanatics,positive
their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive,positive
from these varied reviews i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories,positive
films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed in my opinion if it was not for the outstanding success of scream,positive
the low budget 1996 gem may alongside pulp fiction be the most influential film of the 1990s,positive
this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs tingle or television programs such as dawsons creek but to others such as myself we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors screenwriters and directors,positive
scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quicklypaced script by kevin williamson,positive
within the film are characters who tell other characters as well as the audience the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie,positive
mainly from the rants of randy jamie kennedy and stu matthew lillard we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well the virgin always survives have sex and youre dead meat,positive
not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors,positive
the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own selfsatisfaction,positive
in this case williamson finds these errors for the audiences satisfaction and amusement,positive
i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream which is a spoof of scary movies,positive
i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than screams perfect subtlety,positive
however my last gut feeling about this stuff scream was dead wrong,positive
so who knows,positive
the heartbreak kid reviewed on aug 26th1998,positive
starring charles grodin cybill sheppard eddie albert,positive
in the heartbreak kid charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters ive seen on screen in a long time,positive
hes a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another,positive
i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film,positive
as the film opens he has just gotten married and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon,positive
halfway there he begins to resent his bride,positive
by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character he is ready to divorce his wife,positive
as played by grodin this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him,positive
the phrase the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence was practically written with him in mind,positive
however if he finds something he really wants he will pursue it for as long as it takes,positive
the only problem is once he has it he immediately loses interest,positive
the end of the heartbreak kid is both hilarious and sad for that very reason,positive
charles grodin is at his smarmy best here and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodins desire,positive
however the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin daughter of director elaine may as grodins whiny bride,positive
she owns every scene that shes in and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do,positive
the heartbreak kid was written by neil simon and it shows,positive
simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships and hes at the top of his game here,positive
as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is hes the type of guy that everyone knows,positive
the character of george costanza on seinfeld seems to have been modelled after him,positive
the only problem with the film is that its not that funny and its billed as a comedy,positive
as much as i could see the realism in the characters it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there,positive
the heartbreak kid is not a date movie,positive
it has an extremely negative view of relationships so seeing it with a could be hazardus to your health,positive
ingredients james bond scuba scene car controlled by cellular telephone,positive
synopsis warped media tycoon elliot carver jonathan pryce plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a stealth ship to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing,positive
superagent james bond pierce brosnan uses trick gadgets pluck and charm in order to foil carvers scheme,positive
this time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china michelle yeoh,positive
the film contains fights chases gadgets and comedic moments,positive
opinion it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid enjoyable bond movie,positive
it neither stands out nor disappoints,positive
in old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter,positive
tomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin,positive
like leiters character wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie,positive
stars michelle yeoh was born a leo in the western zodiac in the year of the tiger on the asian astrology calendar,positive
i dont believe in horoscopes,positive
but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers lts,positive
leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace,positive
lts are unbelievably courageous when facing adversity,positive
the lt is also classy and has an excellent sense of refinement but she sees herself as an adventurer and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status symbols,positive
this person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty,positive
she delights in siblings nephews nieces and extended family but she must have her personal freedom to come and go as she pleases,positive
sometimes annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes,positive
in love life the lt has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any partner who is less powerful than she,positive
in real life michelle yeoh is asias top female star,positive
like jackie chan she does her own stunts,positive
she was born in malaysia a country of many languages and her primary language the language she speaks in her sleep is english,positive
she was taught malay in school and learned cantonese from bilingual parents,positive
as an athlete michelle represented malaysia internationally,positive
she enjoyed squash diving swimming and rugby,positive
she studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london but switched to drama after a spinal injury,positive
in 1983 she won the miss malaysia pageant without really intending to since a family member had entered her in the contest without her knowledge,positive
notoriety from the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine,positive
michelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months and a retirement from the movies,positive
her comeback from retirement supercop 1992 became the top grossing film in asia that year,positive
it is not clear what michelles martial arts style is but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun,positive
of her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies michelle says wai lin is the first bond girl who is on a par with bond someone who can match up with him mentally and physically,positive
my own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice,positive
eric rohmers pauline at the beach is one of those small deliberately paced but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise but a lot happens to the characters emotionally,positive
the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast and centers on six different characters primarily pauline amanda langlet a wise beyond her years 15yearold who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin marion arielle dombasle,positive
on the first day at the beach marion runs into an old high school flame fedoore atkine and although he wants to rekindle their relationship she is more interested in an older more seductive womanizer pascal greggory who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor rosette,positive
while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy simon de la brosse,positive
pauline at the beach is not a film in which big dramatic things occur and there is not a clearcut tidy conclusion to the story,positive
instead it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life and the surprises come from little character details the film is quite talky and slow moving and so it is pretty safe to say it isnt for those who are only a fan of action movies but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the bigbudget genre and see a good art film,positive
this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer 1969s my night at mauds and 1971s claires knee that i have seen but his direction is assured and intelligent as is the screenplay which he also wrote,positive
pauline at the beach is a film worth seeing,positive
star wars episode 1 the phantom menace 1999,positive
review by matt pusateri,positive
few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas 1977 classic star wars,positive
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture,positive
arguably more americans today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb,positive
so 22 years after the release of the original and 16 years since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation,positive
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons,positive
against this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week,positive
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment,positive
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking,positive
it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star wars films,positive
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films,positive
as the film opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor quigon jinn liam neeson,positive
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation,positive
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboos young queen amidala natalie portman,positive
later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battledamaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice,positive
on tatooine quigon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts,positive
quigon senses the child is unusually strong with the force and begins to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force,positive
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being a galactic savior the innocentlooking 9yearold will in time become the ruthless darth vader,positive
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala,positive
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul,positive
if the plot sounds a bit complicated it is,positive
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakins turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy,positive
but the complexity is not overwhelming,positive
the story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode,positive
one of the reasons the films story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused,positive
its unclear whose story phantom menace is,positive
in the original trilogy the movies were clearly lukes story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight,positive
but its unclear whether this new film is anakins story or obiwans,positive
if this trilogy is centered on anakin its a shaky foundation,positive
lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive,positive
on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littleboy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that quigon is willing to believe he is the one,positive
the rest of the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas,positive
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight,positive
mcgregor is wellcast as obiwan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility,positive
portman fits the role of a young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality,positive
the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them,positive
individually the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series,positive
but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesnt do as good of a job playing the characters off one another,positive
in star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obiwan and leia and luke,positive
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities,positive
in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other,positive
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other,positive
individually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them,positive
this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers,positive
but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging,positive
many of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining,positive
first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates,positive
the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaursized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetianlooking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part romanchariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council,positive
each location is elaborate and complex,positive
lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines,positive
most of the new special effects in his rereleased special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just werent possible when the films were made,positive
more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures robots with personalities and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters,positive
the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves,positive
watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room,positive
of all the computergenerated characters in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable,positive
speaking of computergenerated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks,positive
with more than 80 minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computergenerated character into the cast of the new trilogy,positive
jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jons accidental sidekick,positive
jar jar usually performs a comicrelief role in the film lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble,positive
the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors,positive
however despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar isnt completely convincing,positive
he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene,positive
throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence,positive
you accept that hes there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character,positive
initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film,positive
on my second viewing of the film jar jar was a lot of fun and i didnt mind him at all,positive
a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates,positive
despite all the films struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about ones destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously,positive
fortunately lucas hasnt lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art,positive
from the bumbling jar jar to a oneman twoheaded announcer team calling the action at the films thrilling podrace sequence to a cameo appearance by e t,positive
in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lots of halfhidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed,positive
and finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action,positive
from beginning to end there are lightsaber battles hairraising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil,positive
the podrace sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film and the final showdown between obiwan quigon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed,positive
the phantom menace wont win any major oscars,positive
it probably wont beat titanics box office record,positive
and its not even the best star wars film id put it third after the original and the empire strikes back,positive
but its an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster,positive
the film cant live up to its hype no film not even the original star wars could have done that,positive
but its still worth seeing,positive
probably more than once,positive
review ghost dog the way of the samurai 1999,positive
cast forest whitaker henry silva cliff gorman john tormey gene riffini victor argo tricia vessey isaach de bankole camille winbush director jim jarmusch writer jim jarmusch,positive
rating good shot stars,positive
languid yet pointed and focused ghost dog the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek ultracool cinematic image of the hitman,positive
juxtaposing the samurais honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the mafia it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptors precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber dinosaurlike to function in the modern era,positive
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit,positive
using a palate of bleached colors jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film,positive
he doesnt cater to audience expectations of hypercolorized stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies,positive
the action is presented in flat brutal codas,positive
bullets have permanence,positive
death has consequences,positive
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty,positive
it is an antimovie of sorts,positive
there are few photogenic empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with,positive
this isnt a film that lovingly holds your hand,positive
there are dark contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder just so asserting itself for all to see,positive
the fulcrum for the movies thematic balancing act is ghost dog a mafia hitman,positive
a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms,positive
unlike the sleek muscular killing machines one is accustomed to we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly replete with chapped dirty hands and rumpled clothing,positive
he wears a hooded sweatshirt which he often pulls over his head giving him a monklike appearance,positive
there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal,positive
he uses old worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical efficient and pleasureless fashion,positive
ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book which he reads daily hagakure the way of the samurai,positive
life consists of simple pleasures for him ice cream warm rooftop naps and good books,positive
ghost dog lives as it were by the basic tenet expressed by his book one should start each day considering oneself as dead,positive
living atop an abandoned building surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends,positive
he craves nothing more,positive
as he puts it late in the film ive seen all i want to see,positive
he exists in a spiritual world of the mind gaining moral sustenance from his readings,positive
ghost dog wasnt always as he is presented,positive
in several roshomonlike flashbacks its shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan that samaritan being a foot soldier in an aging crime family,positive
ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man louie tormey as repayment,positive
after years of loyal service ghost dog is sent by louie to kill handsome frank a made man within louies organization who has run away with the crime bosss daughter louise vessey,positive
ghost dog wordlessly executes his task witnessed by louise whom he spares as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon clutching a copy of the book roshomon,positive
in a bit of synchronicity louise loans the book to ghost dog,positive
upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family the mob bosses in turn put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade,positive
the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict,positive
the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dogs world,positive
each time a character is shown watching a cartoon its from the same era betty boop felix the cat etc a reflection of days gone by,positive
near the end louise is watching a cartoon thats a departure from the previously shown ones,positive
its a bit of audacity on jarmuschs part that is nicely effective despite its surrealistic nature,positive
as ghost dog floats through his world his life is touched by two people,positive
one is a sage little girl winbush who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading,positive
she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities just as louise ultimately does,positive
by films end the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer,positive
the other person in ghost dogs world is an ice cream de bankole vendor who only speaks french yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog,positive
the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land,positive
jarmusch through rza underscores his film with rap and reggae music which at first blush seems dichotomous but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie,positive
ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars,positive
which in and of itself presents another paradox about ghosts dogs sense of honor,positive
the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation,positive
of all the cartoonish mobsters he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world,positive
gorman plays sonny a lieutenant who respects the old ways yet has a quirky affinity for rap music a love comically shown in several impromptu displays,positive
ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia,positive
he is a husk of a man assisted by two hearing aids who barks out advice without truly hearing what he or others are saying,positive
whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actors use his face,positive
ghost dog is reticent to speak often going for long periods without doing so,positive
the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent,positive
although the film has a deliberate pace some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down,positive
truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob,positive
he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world,positive
carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon into a figure that garners sympathy if not a bit of pity,positive
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies,positive
often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple technothriller,positive
in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked,positive
but i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic,positive
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff 1983 film directed by philip kaufman,positive
the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits,positive
but the right stuff film isnt even fiction,positive
it was based on the nonfiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program,positive
the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes,positive
the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier,positive
many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado,positive
but one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records,positive
ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age,positive
in order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space,positive
best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired allamerican image,positive
in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s,positive
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufmans film looks quite atypical for its time,positive
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life,positive
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker,positive
philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies,positive
the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risktaking artsy projects,positive
the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film,positive
the plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts,positive
the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece,positive
that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles,positive
sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty,positive
on the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases,positive
shepards performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as cleancut marine and future politician john glenn,positive
young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward,positive
always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard,positive
kaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives,positive
royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon b johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch,positive
great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufmans superb direction,positive
most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time,positive
the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline,positive
everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world,positive
in that setting its quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights,positive
but the times are changing ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots,positive
their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity,positive
this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space,positive
those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufmans superb use of poetic movie language,positive
editing is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films,positive
although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights,positive
those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space,positive
another fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it,positive
it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy,positive
some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period,positive
this film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws,positive
some of the mercury astronauts arent fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen,positive
film also lacks proper closure,positive
on the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long,positive
also some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagans america,positive
in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s,positive
time has passed now we dont see astronauts as heroes,positive
in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers,positive
few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up,positive
but this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky,positive
and even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema,positive
as the film opens up expectant unwed mother sally played by drew barrymore encounters her babys father in a fast food drivethrough window,positive
after he gets his milkshake he drives off only to be pursued by a military helicopter,positive
from this moment forward you know that this isnt going to be your runofthemill romantic comedy,positive
home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian played by luke wilson a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally more,positive
than he would care to admit hint it has something to do with the father of sallys unborn child,positive
after taking a personal and professional interest in her he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works and the fun goes on from there,positive
this movie is a lot of fun,positive
it is comedic on two levels as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy,positive
the romantic moments are sweet yet not sappy,positive
one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes,positive
however the dark comedic moments are more memorable,positive
this is also a tale of revenge and a funny one at that,positive
the father of sallys unborn child also happened to be a married man whose wife is played by catherine ohara,positive
she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work,positive
my apologies if this sounds cryptic but there is too much of the plot to give away,positive
rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus dorians overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy dorians trainer at the fast food restaurant,positive
the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones even with the romantic nature of the plot,positive
if there are any complaints it is over drew barrymores performance,positive
while she does light up the screen there are moments when she doesnt seem all that convincing,positive
the movie was filmed in texas and most of the characters have southern texan accents,positive
drew barrymores accent tends to come and go luke wilson doesnt seem to have this problem,positive
as well she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant,positive
still this movie is one that will please many viewers,positive
with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments this is sure to entertain,positive
after watching rat race last week i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that when not laughing aloud i had held a grin for virtually all of the films 112 minutes,positive
saturday night i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didnt enjoy it as much the second time as the first,positive
rat race is a great goofy delight a dandy mix of energetic performances inspired sight gags and flatout silliness,positive
hands down this is the most fun film of the summer,positive
the movie begins with zippy retrostyle opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a 60s slapstick comedy featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herkyjerky bodies bounding around the screen,positive
then comes the setup,positive
donald sinclair john cleese the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients,positive
to that end he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines,positive
gathering together the lucky token holders he explains today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six,positive
the competition is simple each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city n m containing 2 million in cash,positive
there is a transmitter in every key so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead,positive
the race has no rules whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money,positive
since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes lets use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers,positive
decked out in flashy trashy clothing and sporting big hair vera baker whoopi goldberg is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby,positive
she finds that grownup merrill lanai chapman is erudite conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life,positive
thrown together it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature,positive
owen templeton cuba gooding jr is currently the most hated man in america,positive
an nfl referee he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a highprofile game,positive
after escaping from a vengeful cab driver owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention,positive
mr pollini rowan atkinson is a cheerful odd little italian man on holiday in america,positive
he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times,positive
pollini hitches a ride with zack wayne knight a hypertense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation,positive
randy pear jon lovitz promised his wife beverly kathy najimy and two kids a funfilled vacation in las vegas,positive
fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview,positive
beverly insists the family stay together so they hop in the minivan and tear off into the desert,positive
brothers duane seth green and blaine vince vieluf cody are young crooked and stupid,positive
blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly selfdone tongue piercing and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him,positive
the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal,positive
finally nick shaffer breckin meyer is a nononsense lawyerintraining who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet amy smart for the journey,positive
at first glance they seem blandly wholesome but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn dean cain and spies him swimming with another woman,positive
director jerry zucker airplane ghost leaps from racer to racer periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr grisham dave thomas his personalityimpaired right hand man continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers,positive
as with any zucker production a few jokes fall flat but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps,positive
high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny payoff,positive
had i been part of the filmmaking team i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a babys clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron,positive
it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirminducing hint of child molestation,positive
i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence,positive
my god do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing all star,positive
but enough carping,positive
rat race is a riot with terrific noholdsbarred performances from the diverse cast,positive
see it see it again and when the dvd comes out buy it because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for,positive
youve seen this moment before recently a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing,positive
the difference is that when it happens to lili taylors nell in the haunting we dont care,positive
the hero of the sixth sense a young boy named cole is a rich creation and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike,positive
the seasons have changed since an expatient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe willis in the comfort of his own bedroom,positive
desperate to get his career back on track even at the expense of his crumbling marriage to williams of rushmore malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole osment,positive
the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolms wouldbe killer scars on his body antisocial behaviour and the reluctance to reveal a big secret,positive
only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies and hospitalized as a result does he divulge to malcolm in a spinetingling scene that he sees dead people walking among us all the time,positive
malcolm assumes and given his profession reasonably so that cole is schizophrenic not psychic but the sincerity in coles anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures,positive
he will instead pursue the supernatural angle becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole who lives with his single mother lynn collette in the process,positive
the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist,positive
though shyamalan does somewhat unforgiveably crib the selfrearranging kitchen business from the latter,positive
its far more heartwarming than frightening and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks,positive
cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown but theyre not out to harm him reallythey just want to be heard even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler,positive
perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us at first than they really are because were looking at the situation through the eyes of an eightyearold,positive
thats right willis for the first time in years gives up the spotlight to his costar,positive
we appreciate malcolms domestic dilemma but we identify with cole recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed,positive
both actors deliver immensely likable performances and their dynamic is manifest,positive
willis convinces us that hes a doctor something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night,positive
osment is phenomenal a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do,positive
the sixth sense atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer tak fujimoto is actually a dramaits spooky effective ad campaign is misleading,positive
only because i was expecting something different did i noticerather feelthe movies running time which is just shy of two hours,positive
the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait,positive
im not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof but i admired its audacity,positive
imagine this,positive
youre given a sword and a shield and very basic minimal training,positive
a man you dont know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live,positive
you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die,positive
you frantically monitor several closed doors which in seconds will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you,positive
you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood,positive
if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you you know youre going to have to do it all over again tomorrow,positive
eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are youre going to die,positive
this is the life of a gladiator,positive
youll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scotts powerful gladiator youll be thankful for that,positive
with his new film scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire,positive
and like those preceding it spartacus and ben hur gladiator has nearly everything going for it a strong lead actor a wonderful supporting cast eyecatching special effects and a great script,positive
since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator teenagers to thirtyyearold males were around a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited,positive
from a weak beginning the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious,positive
romes best general maximus russell crowe who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted is currently in the year 180 a d that is waging a war against germania,positive
scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective,positive
its blurry in slow motion and the sound is muted,positive
as soon as this artistic method began it was hard to tell what was what and who was who,positive
its a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch,positive
instead the general swears he will get out after this battle,positive
he wants to go back to his family and his crops he wants a quiet life,positive
but unexpectedly he gets anything but that,positive
the dying emperor of rome marcus aurelius richard harris decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies,positive
he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators,positive
all of this does not go well for aurelius son commodus joaquin phoenix who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor,positive
jealous and upset commodus kills his own father names himself emperor kills maximus wife and son and attempts to kill maximus,positive
but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius wishes,positive
now a slave the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator who eventually are released for their success,positive
a story of betrayal and promises gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick,positive
you actually care about the characters sometimes even the evil villain commodus who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way,positive
phoenix plays his character brilliantly,positive
think of commodus as the percy wetmore of pantwetter the green mile of the roman empire a whiny sleazy respectmebecausemyfatherwasagoodman brat who hates when hes not the center of attention,positive
every scene we see commodus hes either crying or he looks like he has just been crying,positive
phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for and gladiator shows hes more than just rivers little brother,positive
crowe is also excellent as the films grislyfaced hero,positive
maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions,positive
this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act hes no invincible superhero who only blurts out oneliners he believe it or not acts like a human being,positive
the rest of the cast including richard harris djimon hounsou walter hill derek jacobi and connie nielsen are also first rate,positive
ridley scott using outstanding special effects has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum the loudness of the roman mob and the city of rome in general,positive
the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous like a cleopatra of the year 2000,positive
the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upperclass politicians,positive
gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience,positive
along with u571 action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000,positive
allen star of many a brian depalma movie in the early eighties has a brief throwaway part towards the end of out of sight as the maid of a crooked financier,positive
in keeping with her past performances allen wears little more than a green velvet victorias secret ensemble which begs the question did they really need a costume designer for this,positive
out of sight is not likely to secure ms allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation jackie brown but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the also starring credits given her limited screen time,positive
the real stars of out of sight are george clooney batman robin by way of e r and jennifer lopez selena whose winning chemistry coupled with steven soderberghs freezeframe directorial technique help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonards original work,positive
with the success of get shorty three years ago filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream up a storyline from scratch,positive
in out of sight clooney stars as jack foley a career criminal who specializes in unarmed robberyhe just waltzes into banks and politely makes a withdrawal claiming that his partner just another customer it so happens will shoot the manager if the teller doesnt comply,positive
for all of jacks niceguy charm though hes not very lucky,positive
his latest scam lands him in floridas glades correctional facility,positive
federal marshal karen sisco lopez coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack and his buddy ving rhames typically appealing are breaking out,positive
theres a brief struggle and jack bundles himself and karen into the trunk of the getaway car,positive
its in these cramped confines pressed intimately together that jack and karen start falling for one another,positive
the mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one anothers grasp,positive
karen follows jack to detroit where hes about to pull off another heist this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley played by a toupeesporting albert brooks almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes,positive
its during this final capergoneawry that allen makes her scant appearance,positive
clooneys range as an actor is limited but he has undeniable charm,positive
lopez too is easy on the eyes but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen a tough yet tender professional,positive
she dispenses with hit men as easily as she outmaneuvers sleazy pickup artists in a bar,positive
especially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub,positive
admirably supporting clooney and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice snoopy miller steve zahn as the perennially stoned glenn michaels and dennis farina as karens dad who affectionately buys her a piece,positive
add a couple of uncredited cameos from jackie brown cast members and out of sight proves to be a lot of fun,positive
not as hip and clever as shorty perhaps or as complex and colorful as brown but loads of fun nonetheless,positive
the celebration is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant,positive
you know where you sit down to watch it and no matter what youve heard about it before you just cant help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs,positive
i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like,positive
i dont really feel there are to be any real rules for cinema a film can do anything as long as it makes it work,positive
but i do ask that all films have one thing in common they create experiences,positive
when i watch a film no matter what kind of film it is i want to be able to take certain memories along with me,positive
the celebration is great because its chock full of those,positive
it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life,positive
and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial just to make sure youre paying attention which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored then youre of your attention span needs a bit of a tuningup,positive
the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch henning mortizen who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him,positive
all his friends and family turn up and for the first half hour we get introduced to everyone simplistically and realistically no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here,positive
the eldest son christian ulrich thomsen looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell is the first to be seen in the film walking to his fathers home,positive
his brother michael thomas bo larsen drives by pulls over greets him then kicks his family out of the car forcing them to walk to the estate just so christian can be comfortable,positive
we then meet helene paprika steen their sister a woman who always seems to be stressedout who invites the driver of her car gbatokai dakinah an american to to come join her at the party shes going to,positive
once theyre all there and settled in the party begins and as custom the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad so christian stands up at the head of the table and reveals the films punchline his father raped all his children at a young age,positive
but since this is a affair his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth and is simply brushed off despite his efforts and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir and its all terribly interesting to watch,positive
twists occur and soon the film has taken on a nearlyfarsical nature but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends,positive
the most notorious thing about this film which has been getting the most notice though is that the director thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion,positive
as a member of the danish filmmakers clan dogme 95 a group that has vowed to oppose the auteur concept makeup illusions and dramaturgical predictability so that they may purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot,positive
i have not seen breaking the waves the other notable film by a member of this group lars von trier to be exact but the celebration works exquisitely in this department,positive
it feels like reality like youre actually watching real people and not actors and as a major pointer has been shot on video,positive
as a result it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film but always wanted to,positive
we see key moments in peoples lives that they wouldnt dare show to the world and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style as ironicallyshowmanship as it really is works perfectly for the nature of the film,positive
the key though to this film and the reason its not just a cool danish import is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth,positive
throughout the film we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies a debate so threedimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his thetruthatallcosts reasoning out of the water,positive
of course it was not right for the father to rape his children and of course they couldnt have fought back then and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them,positive
and yes its thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier,positive
but then again the father after all is not a totally bad guy and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier we also see a man who has also learned to live with what hes done and deep down feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface,positive
the final scene involving mortizen and everyone else is utterly devastating thanks to him and thomsen whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex,positive
everyone else is flawless as well the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them,positive
the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays exactly like life,positive
as such the celebration may be the one truly bizarro film of the year a work of art so eerily close to reality that its utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating,positive
one of kyle mclachlans earlier cinematic features this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator 810 species 710 and the more recent fallen with denzel washington,positive
plot a sciencefiction picture set in modern times this thriller follows the exploits of an entity from outer space who likes to inhabit human bodies use them up until they are completely worn out and then switch over to the next available receptacle,positive
fbi agent mclachlan and local top cop nouri are charged with the capture of this thing before its too late,positive
critique this fastpaced urban equivalent of the thing 810 checks in on all cylinders for ultraviolence god knows how many people died in this movie action and an overall rock n roll attitude,positive
then again how can you go wrong with an alien that likes the ferraris guns heavy metal music and sexy girls,positive
granted the plot isnt the most elaborate of tales alien bad find alien kill alien but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture,positive
i wouldnt recommend it to those who dont like car chases murders and bland acting but for all the rest of you out there those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again sitting back slamming back some salsad nachos and relishing in the cheeze some call film,positive
have a blast,positive
two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gorefest,positive
the opening sequence is one of the most rockin scenes to open any action movie and the subsequent extraterrestrial transformation is another eyecatcher,positive
even the late 80s special effects were okay,positive
followed by the hidden ii in 1994,positive
little known facts this film was kyle maclachlans first nondavid lynch foray into the world of feature films,positive
his first two movie appearances were in lynchs wretched dune 410 and the sensational blue velvet 8 510,positive
warren beattys bulworth is a caustic political comedy that doesnt attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system,positive
some might think this film is vulgar and in many ways it is,positive
however as loud and raucous as it is bulworth speaks the truth which is almost always ugly to hear,positive
beatty who directed the film and cowrote the script with jeremy pikser the lemon sisters stars as incumbent u s senator jay billington bulworth who has one of the best politician names in cinema history,positive
bulworth is a democrat and in beattys view he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party,positive
once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington,positive
instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden which was once the calling card of democrats bulworth has become another sellout money hound if hes not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese hes making windbag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium,positive
blah blah blah,positive
when the film opens it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become,positive
in a fit of desperation he takes out a 10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee and then hires a hit man to kill him although he doesnt know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place,positive
knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general,positive
at a compton church he tells the group of africanamericans that they will have no power in the u s unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife,positive
later in a particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason hes there is because my guys always put the big jews on my schedule,positive
all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworths chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment,positive
platt has some of the movies funniest scenes as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet,positive
his constant halftruthtelling and spindoctoring to cover bulworths stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a selfrighteous reporter nora dunn who acts like murphys refusal to explain bulworths actions something he really cannot do is somehow an act of treason,positive
when bulworth decides he wants to live after all and therefore must constantly evade a grimlooking assassin to be whos trailing him at every turn he hides out in the ghetto complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews,positive
at this point beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black innercity experience,positive
bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina halle berry who he meets at the harlem church rally,positive
she has a toughtalking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l d,positive
don cheadle of boogie nights who also becomes involved in bulworths campaign,positive
some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense innercity films like boyznhood 1991 and menace ii society 1993,positive
bulworths chief liability is beattys insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device,positive
instead of speaking at political rallies he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hiphop stars are black,positive
its hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad or whether hes actually that incompetent,positive
at any rate the rap sounds more run d m c,positive
than snoop doggy dogg which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary,positive
beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the innercity lingo and working that into his speeches instead of trying to sound like l l cool j,positive
other than that bulworth hits all its targets with wry hilarious accuracy,positive
the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party and even if you dont agree with beattys liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics,positive
unlike primary colors which opened earlier this year bulworth doesnt try to tiptoe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home instead it takes them deadon,positive
at one point during brian de palmas crime epic scarface the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves cant you stop saying fuck all the time,positive
fucking good question that,positive
it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride but as far as i can tell oliver stones script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history,positive
yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palmas scarface is remembered for because this is a damn fine gangstar flick,positive
the overall structure is similar to howard hawks 1932 original but this time the scene has switched to miami florida and our antiheros chosen vice is cocaine traffiking,positive
pacino sporting a thick cuban accent gives one the best performances of his career golden globe nominated as tony montana a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream,positive
and live it out he does with lashings of violence abuse murder and the funny white powder,positive
from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that hes not a man to be fucked sorry,positive
soon hes the king of the cocaine heap but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing,positive
never do your own stash warns one character early in the film,positive
as sure as night follows day the emperor of miami eventually falls,positive
writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here,positive
stones script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development,positive
montana is fascinating uneducated but calculating a straight shooter who speaks from the heart an ambitious violent man yet one with a conscience,positive
a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy dangerous world which he inhabits,positive
pacino is dynamite taking to the role with a brooding bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting,positive
pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life,positive
only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends and shes happy to oblige,positive
this isnt as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stones was in casino but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well,positive
as director de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva,positive
the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations a drug deal gone wrong an assination attempt is often thrilling and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola,positive
where he differs from say coppolas godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment,positive
coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel,positive
and it perfectly suits the material,positive
the only major botch is giorgio moroders mostly crap synthesier score,positive
its just not right and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes,positive
as expected scarface is very violent at times but you shouldnt be watching gangster movies if that upsets you,positive
at over two and a half hours in length its a true epic and if youre a fan of the genre youll love f kfilled minute of it,positive
bruce willis and sixth sense director m night shyamalan reteam to tell the story of david dunne willis a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child,positive
on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of,positive
to make things even stranger dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed,positive
a comic book art dealer named elijah price samuel l jackson who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life,positive
price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him,positive
someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break,positive
price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child,positive
dunne doesnt believe him at first but price assists him in discovering his powers and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is,positive
m night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense,positive
how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years,positive
for shyamalan the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners,positive
does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash though,positive
the answer to that question is not a very easy one either,positive
as far as pacing goes the sixth sense seemed almost interminable,positive
it wasnt until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order to give the audience ample time to reconnect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached,positive
for unbreakable shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which in many ways blows away the film that had come before,positive
the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalans direction is excellent with the camera almost constantly moving,positive
there are tons of great shots in the film not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger,positive
the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak,positive
also very impressive is the films score by james newton howard who also scored shyamalans sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes as well as this years dinosaur,positive
several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film,positive
one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to exercise his powers,positive
the music in combination with the stellar visuals really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie,positive
if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year this one would be it,positive
the film also boasts some great performances including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment,positive
willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne who just cant seem to figure out why hes been depressed for the last few years,positive
his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him but he eventually grows into his own under elijahs tutelage,positive
jackson is one of the better actors of our time and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah,positive
though his hairstyle is absurd jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked,positive
robin wright penns role seems slightly underwritten but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her characters need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again,positive
spencer treat clark as the dunnes young son jeremy shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film,positive
out of all the characters jeremys is perhaps the most emotional and clark does a great job with the role,positive
where the film does lose points though is during its surprise ending,positive
shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense but i found myself saying that was it,positive
when unbreakable revealed its own ending,positive
its not that the ending is bad its just that the ending doesnt quite have the emotional punch that the other films did,positive
plus it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels and i wont reveal the ending here but youll understand what i mean when you see it,positive
essentially what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable,positive
the only real problem is that the ending doesnt quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor,positive
as long as it isnt held to the standard that sixth sense set which it ultimately will be it should be a remarkably well liked film,positive
one thing seems clear though,positive
shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film,positive
one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length,positive
if a film is only 90 minutes but feels like 300 minutes then its crap,positive
but if a film last 2 12 hours and feels like 90 minutes then its excellent,positive
boogie nights falls into the latter catagory,positive
the director anderson delivers a funny hip yet sometimes violent film which flies along,positive
mark whalberg a k a,positive
marky mark plays eddie adams a seventeen year old with a certain gift in the midriff area,positive
jack horner reynolds is a adult film director who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business,positive
after running away from home eddie joins jack changes his name to dirk diggler and starts making erotic movies,positive
in the movie business dirk meets a whole load of characters which the film introduces very quickly and slickly such as scotty phillip seymour hoffman rollergirl graham amber moore and floyd phillip baker hall and little bill william h macy all the characters are well written well played and the audience gets to know them pretty well thanks to the excellent script,positive
we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce rollergirls hard time at school and little bills wife who sleeps with everyone except her husband,positive
but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing,positive
the direction is fast thrilling and never holds up,positive
there are some great shots some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences and lots of other neat directional touches,positive
the writing is fabulous with some intelligent dialogue some funny dialogue but none of the dialogue is crap like most hollywood films such as the lost world jurassic park 1997 or tommorow never dies 1997,positive
boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing on par and sometimes betters quentin tarantinos films resevoir dogs 1992 and pulp fiction 1994,positive
the soundtrack is also excellent,positive
like american graffiti 1973 the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack which heightens the atmosphere and gives the film an extra lift,positive
also the costumes are great,positive
the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties,positive
the film although excellent does have some flaws,positive
firstly wahlberg although excellent cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry,positive
in both scenes where he has to act angry his acting is so off the scenes tension and anger is lost,positive
but the rest of the cast are excellent,positive
burt reynolds is brilliant julianne moore shows real emotion and william h macy is great aswell but he always is,positive
another flaw with the film though is that the ending seems a bit tacked on,positive
it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit and needed to wrap up quickly,positive
its a shame really as the rest of the film is perfectly paced,positive
but theyre small niggles really,positive
boogie nights is an excellent film,positive
superb directing writing acting and music all combine to make one spectacular film,positive
whatever you do do not miss out on boogie nights,positive
if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films its their predictable endings,positive
the devils advocate has the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen does,positive
unfortunately for the devils advocate this ending nearly collapses in on itself and ruins the entire film,positive
nevertheless the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film,positive
i dont think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan,positive
well it does contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements and seemingly more interesting ones at that,positive
the devils advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session,positive
kevin lomax keanu reeves is the defense attorney working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl,positive
he ends up with a notguilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo,positive
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury,positive
he accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he flies to new york with his wife,positive
after proving his worth for selecting juries and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer,positive
he graciously accepts where he is treated almost as a god,positive
he is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and a hefty paycheck,positive
his life seems to be on the rise,positive
and of course his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline,positive
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment,positive
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice especially if it is not wanted,positive
meanwhile kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen craig t nelson who apparently murdered three people,positive
he spends hours upon hours with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane,positive
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself,positive
after a while things turn completely upsidedown as kevins wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends,positive
a fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevins real father,positive
is it all just a big nightmare,positive
or is john milton really satan playing tricks with kevins life,positive
the devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we dont expect,positive
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed,positive
if so the devils advocate messes up completely and ironically i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early,positive
i went into the devils advocate expecting a shocking horror film and that is exactly what i got,positive
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what i got,positive
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did i mention that i didnt like the ending,positive
the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending they pull the rug out from under you,positive
films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less,positive
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way,positive
the devils advocate on the other hand ends unpredictably not from us knowing a lot but knowing nothing at all,positive
if that is confusing i recommend watching the film and then reading that again,positive
as for the film overall i enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study,positive
the film runs like a wellbuilt clock slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that,positive
and then you settle in for a nice resolution which does not occur,positive
it was at this point that i felt cheated,positive
taking us on a terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiece of the film,positive
everything occurs from his perspective,positive
he is our representation on screen sort of,positive
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game,positive
i dont want to spoil the ending so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself,positive
perhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything,positive
it earned its r rating for a reason,positive
there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity,positive
this film really isnt subtle about anything showing us everything,positive
it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc17 rating as it is quite harsh,positive
however the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those,positive
i dont condone sex and nudity in films but if its there i might as well enjoy it,positive
the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch,positive
the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann,positive
portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary anns problems are incredibly intense and i found myself wanting to witness her decline,positive
this may sound uncaring but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her,positive
she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into a world where she is not wanted,positive
something the devils advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for a film of this nature,positive
the story actually has something to say about humanity,positive
in one of the last scenes john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children he is satan of course,positive
he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity,positive
then god sets up rules which contradict human nature,positive
this semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening,positive
what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it was funny but patially realizing it was true,positive
these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devils advocate giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing but im sure they came straight from the novel it was based on,positive
when a film has something to say about our society it deserves to be watched,positive
the cast of the devils advocate is one of the highlights as we see memorable faces and they put spins on those memorable faces we dont expect,positive
heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she does a great job,positive
probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves,positive
he has proven himself an uneven actor successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic but he tops himself with this performance,positive
i have never seen him more believable to date,positive
al pacino is of course the scene stealer,positive
his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witches of eastwick and max von sydow needful things,positive
he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term,positive
jeffrey jones mostly known as the principal in ferris buellers day off also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon,positive
judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevins past,positive
connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several times,positive
one familiar face with a twist was coach star craig t nelson who gives a very good performance,positive
the devils advocate is rated r for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore,positive
at 144 minutes this film moves along fairly quickly,positive
for the first two hours i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters,positive
the technical quality is also remarkable with great special effects and a good musical score,positive
director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes,positive
i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for a long time,positive
but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream,positive
personally i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early,positive
this british import follows the mis adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths,positive
there is marc renton who narrates spud the dimwitted one sick boy the sean connery obsessive and begbee the violence obsessive,positive
powered by a top rate but not top name soundtrack iggy pop sleeper elastica lou reed the film follows renton who gets clean gets back into heroin and gets clean again,positive
some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fictionesque and some is just dumb dumber gross the bed sheets and stupid the bb gun although the film starts out on a comic note it takes a sharp term in the middle and becomes almost depressing,positive
the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title,positive
i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,positive
it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4,positive
the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors,positive
this is a very original film as far as films go today,positive
it definetly deserves multiple viewings partly because of the slang and accents jeremy dennison mr orange net,positive
towards the middle of the sweet hereafter a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend careens through the steel guard rail and disappears out of sight,positive
then in long shot we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snowcovered field,positive
it pauses for a moment before the field cracks under the bus weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment a single smooth second of time,positive
compare that scene if you will to the last eighty minutes of titanic when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise and youll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films,positive
the scene in the sweet hereafter epitomizes all thats right with independent canadian director atom egoyans film,positive
its not sensational,positive
we dont see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming terrified children being bloodied and battered about,positive
the bus doesnt explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces,positive
it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake,positive
its a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance,positive
using a nonlinear approach to his narrative egoyan shifts back and forward in time connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy,positive
fourteen children died in the accident leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief,positive
the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit,positive
stephens who doesnt believe in accidents functions as a concerned involved observer scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath,positive
while stephens initial drive may be financial one third of the total settlement if he wins his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss,positive
his selfdestructive drugaddicted daughter has been in and out of clinics halfway houses and detox units for years,positive
egoyans attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry,positive
mychael danna who composed the shimmering music for the ice storm contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles,positive
equally impressive is paul sarossys cinematography capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and lowhanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiorsin one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room,positive
the sweet hereafter while undeniably grim urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go,positive
its a film of generous subtlety and emotion,positive
oliver stones latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents,positive
its a threehour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century,positive
stone doesnt hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house,positive
the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done,positive
at the same time he creates a very human character a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics which is here pictured as a wild animal,positive
he is simply trying to tame it,positive
but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the presidents ability to control them,positive
stone doesnt in any way apologize for nixon,positive
he blames not only nixons own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself the system that once set in motion behaves with a mindlessness of its own,positive
nixon is a modern shakespeare story a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws,positive
theres something almost majestic about the process as nixon goes down in this film there is no gloating but a watery sigh as of a great ship sinking,positive
sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president,positive
joan allens magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette,positive
she is strong and loyal as mrs nixon,positive
the rest of the cast is equally magnificent including james woods j t walsh paul sorvino ed harris and bob hoskins,positive
everyone does a serious and demanding job no one are disappointing,positive
stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy honest and determined,positive
he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element,positive
at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixons youth and childhood,positive
the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin robert richardsons rich cinematography and john williams musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere,positive
the films only fault is that its a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers,positive
still its an honest and captivating a solid piece of movie making,positive
ive been told by several people youre old fashioned,positive

in some ways the slickest film yet from nonfiction auteur morris the thin blue line a brief history of time fast cheap out of control is reportage of the highest order,positive
journalism students should dream of making connections like these,positive
crosscutting among interviews and filmed segments morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix,positive
the fun is settling into your theater seat and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with the other,positive
what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick an interrogative sleight of hand,positive
one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary besides the alwaysstriking visuals is the interview style where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer,positive
weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations morris developed an elaborate doublecamera gadget he calls halfjokingly the interrotron,positive
through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject and vice versa these folks talk startlingly right to the camera to the video image of morris and by extension to the audience,positive
the gardener wonders whether after his death anyone will be interested in maintaining the garden that hes devoted half his life to tending,positive
the robot scientist is more than a little pleased to note that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is a complicated set of sensory receptors,positive
the mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin animals behave like insects and notes that they may be more suited to longterm survival than people,positive
and the circus trainer pines for a longlost ideal that was exemplified by worldrenowned trainer and showman clyde beatty who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere excerpted at some length here with affection,positive
starting to detect the patterns,positive
fast cheap out of control contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections culminating in what feels like an elegy the film is dedicated to morriss late mother and stepfather,positive
the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future,positive
the title is taken from brooks wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface creating a sort of road map for the terrain fast cheap and out of control,positive
with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson oliver stones longtime collaborator this becomes a cinematic contraption thats a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence,positive
further enhancing the pictures wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson,positive
different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film or a surrealist dream,positive
by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship invention and existence itself morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes creation evolution death in earthbound lives,positive
at the same time and just as significantly he pays tribute to a consuming passion for ones work,positive
this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything youll encounter in pop culture this year and the visuals cry out for the big screen,positive
dont miss it,positive
directed by errol morris edited by karen schmeer and shondra merrill cinematography by robert richardson music by caleb sampson u s 1997,positive
reflecting on bedazzled a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser one sinful thought remains in my mind,positive
if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley who portrays the fiery demon then use that pitchfork and point me the way,positive
with her pouty lips irresistible british accent and wild display of haute couture hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation,positive
its practically impossible to turn this beelzubabe down,positive
her next target is elliot brendan fraser a tech support geek who is clumsy awkward and just too eager to please,positive
to aptly picture him you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring steve the copy guy who effortlessly irritated his coworkers with his unpolished social skills,positive
eugene thus is loathed and feared by his coworkers who do their best to stay out of his way,positive
yet beyond his annoying mannerisms hes a lovable oaf,positive
he wishes that he could get closer to allison frances oconnor a coworker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him,positive
however the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowballs chance in hell,positive
dear god he prays,positive
i would give anything to have that girl in my life,positive
guess who then shows up,positive
she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse,positive
seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul,positive
theres even an escape clause,positive
if elliots wish doesnt go exactly the way he likes he need only beep her one guess as to what the threedigit number is and he gets to start over,positive
the remainder of the film consists of elliots various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth power fame and allisons love,positive
but when he makes sweeping statements such as i want to be very very powerful and very very rich and married to allison hell soon learn that the devil is in the details,positive
for example and weve seen this several times in the trailers he is granted his wish but finds out that hes a columbian drug lord and that allison while married to him has her eyes on someone else,positive
apparently the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul,positive
his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that shortcircuits his new life,positive
soon elliot wishes that he had never made that deal,positive
given the mischievous nature of the devil bedazzled has many amusing moments,positive
a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance,positive
he ably assumes various personas,positive
his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world,positive
allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her,positive
hurley also heightens the humor quotient especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one,positive
its clear that shes having a good time with it all,positive
yet while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story,positive
but that would be playing with fire,positive
what theyve got works so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is,positive
in october of 1997 audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer,positive
the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u s and even developed a cult following much like the previous years 100 million dollar grossing scream,positive
when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend it looked like a wonderful followup,positive
did it live up to the first film,positive
the answer is no,positive
jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before,positive
she has been so upset since the incident,positive
nightmares haunt her all over the place but she has to move on,positive
she know attends college and is best friends with a funny outgoing girl named karla brandy who is trying to hook julie up with will benson played by newcomer matthew settle,positive
karlas boyfriend is tyrell the funny outgoing type who is played by soul foods mekhi phifer,positive
freddie prinze jr also returns as ray julies boyfriend from a year ago,positive
one morning julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil,positive
of course they answer it correctly and they are off to the bahamas,positive
julie wants ray to come but he declines the offer so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie,positive
after they arrive at their hotel it is just them and the staff on the island,positive
it starts off as the weekend of their dreams,positive
something just had to come to mess up the one carefree weekend of julies life though,positive
ben willis muse watson is back and he isnt letting anyone survive this time,positive
will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one,positive
jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances,positive
brandy in particular was impressive considering this is her first feature film,positive
you could see that the characters were horrified and they would do anything possible to survive,positive
matthew settle and freddie prinze jr are a completely different story,positive
lets start with settle,positive
matthew is completely fake in this film,positive
you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth,positive
you could tell he was acting and its reasons like him that this one isnt as good as the first one,positive
he does do a good job towards the end but that doesnt clear up the scars he already left on the film,positive
freddie prinze jr is almost as bad as matthew settle was,positive
he is almost completely unbelievable and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place,positive
we dont see him as much as settle otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did,positive
mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell but yet again the dialogue is out of place,positive
the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie,positive
i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one it would have been a bit better,positive
the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful,positive
there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel,positive
the sound is pretty good but still not as creepy as the first films,positive
jennifer love hewitts song how do i deal is also played for about thirty seconds,positive
i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film,positive
the first film was very suspenseful and it contained some very memorable scenes,positive
the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up and almost reached the same level as the first film,positive
before this part in the film there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares,positive
that is okay though because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes,positive
i think the reason this film wasnt as scary as the original was because in the first one the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident,positive
he made them suffer for what they did,positive
in the second film ben willis just kills anyone he feels like,positive
he doesnt stick with ray and julie who were the ones he is actually after,positive
he had to go after karla will and tyrell,positive
if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie ray helen and barry it could have been much better and it would have made a lot more sense,positive
the bottom line not a disappointment but a third in the series would be out of hand,positive
having not seen who framed roger rabbit in over 10 years and not remembering much besides that i liked it then i decided to rent it recently,positive
watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is,positive
aside from the fact that its a milestone in animation in movies its the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters have them interact and make it convincingly real and a great entertainment its also quite an effective,positive
while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original especially baby herman and watching them together is a lot of fun,positive
the story begins in hollywood in 1947,positive
cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work so hardboiled private detective eddie valiant bob hoskins is called in by studio head r k,positive
maroon alan tilvern to try to help get rogers mind back on work,positive
maroon thinks that rogers wife jessicas possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots,positive
valiant takes some photos of jessica playing patty cake with marvin acme stubby kaye the owner of toontown where all of the cartoon characters live and takes them to maroon,positive
upon seeing them roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect,positive
the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town and eventually toontown trying to clear rogers good name,positive
along the way they meet judge doom christopher lloyd a judgejuryand executioner type whos out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a toon,positive
who framed roger rabbit won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in,positive
director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production which included hundreds of animators,positive
also bob hoskins performance should be credited,positive
he in addition to the rest of the human cast finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon costars,positive
according to the internet movie database hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off,positive
who framed roger rabbit is a rare film,positive
one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom,positive
do yourself a favor and rent it ppppplease,positive
being the selfproclaimed professional film critic that i am i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia coming soon to dvd until only recently,positive
after all its considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai and doctor zhivago,positive
so one day a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it,positive
i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the buttnumbing 3 12 hours of its duration,positive
but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture director editing cinematography art direction music and sound,positive
after watching the film again i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen,positive
based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t e,positive
lawrence during world war i lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence played by thenunknown actor peter otoole as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever,positive
bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be reassigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army,positive
lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i,positive
shot in panavisions famed super 70mm format the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic,positive
it is absolutely breathtaking,positive
using stunning cinematography costuming and direction shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes,positive
every shot is choreographed as a portrait a living tribute to a great land,positive
david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time a far cry from its pathetic uncreative existence today,positive
after watching the film the first thing that came to my mind was ive got to do a remake of this film,positive
but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modernday movie executive okay its going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert,positive
we are going to need to blow up a fullsize train because computergenerated effects probably wont do it justice,positive
and we are not going to use any big stars and wont have any female actors since theres no love story,positive
yes my friends the velvet curtain fell on the goldenera of hollywood a long time ago,positive
but at least we still have the proof to show all wouldbe producers and directors out there just how good a film can be,positive
alchemy is steeped in shades of blue,positive
kieslowskis blue that is,positive
with its examination of death isolation character restoration and recovery from loss suzanne myers new independent film echoes the polish directors internationallyacclaimed 1993 release,positive
language aside the principal difference between the films is that while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main characters world alchemy keeps its viewers at arms length,positive
as a result while were able to appreciate the films intellectual tapestry it is emotionally distant,positive
alchemy is divided into three chapters charity faith and hope,positive
while there are common themes and story elements running through all three the single constant is the main character a translator named louisa rya kihlstedt,positive
when the film opens shes living with her painter boyfriend whom she believes to be cheating on her,positive
following his sudden death in an automobile accident louisas life is thrown into turmoil,positive
events swirls around her and she cant find a source of stability,positive
in her quest to make sense out of her loss she befriends her late boyfriends mistress visits her ill sister and eventually abandons her old life by joining a backto nature cult,positive
alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues,positive
in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process the meaning of love and the nature of art,positive
does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar,positive
are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life with all of its various distractions to the fullest,positive
myers challenge is to make these subjects art film staples engrossing in a new context,positive
through louisas struggles she succeeds,positive
while alchemy isnt always emotionally appealing it never loses its fascination,positive
even when were not connecting with louisa who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fullydeveloped personality theres enough material onscreen to hold our attention,positive
the cinematography is stunning,positive
city scenes are tinted with blue adding a cold bleak dimension to the films early portions,positive
later when louisa reaches the wilderness were treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor brightlycolored leaves in the trees and on the ground,positive
its a startlingbuteffective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisas life as she travels the road back to emotional stability,positive
the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith healers who use alchemy to provide for the needs of the body and soul,positive
and although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine its ultimately love and companionship not alchemy that brings solace,positive
her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is lifes ultimate goal,positive
even though louisas final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character its still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch,positive
alchemy isnt pure magic but especially during its best moments its close,positive
i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david leans war picture,positive
i still think that the bridge on the river kwai doesnt deserve being the number 13 in the american film institutes list of the 100 greatest american movies,positive
and i think that 12 angry men witness for the prosecution and paths of glory would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957,positive
but i cant deny the importance of the bridge on the river kwai cinematically and in its contents,positive
the film is set in burma in 1943,positive
a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai,positive
but the british commanding officer colonel nicholson alec guinness insists corresponding to the geneva conventions that his officers neednt work as simple workmen,positive
struggling toughly col nicholson forces the japanese commandant col saito sessue hayakawa to give way in this respect,positive
afterwards col nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge,positive
he considers it an opportunity to raise his mens morale and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese,positive
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge among them the american shears william holden an escapee from the japanese prison camp and the british major warden jack hawkins,positive
a flaw of the picture is the clich d characterization of the japanese people,positive
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge,positive
and the film doesnt consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in paths of glory,positive
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies,positive
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col nicholson and col saito,positive
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears who doubts the military logic is presented as a somehow unpleasant person,positive
the audience is supposed to applaud col nicholsons perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not,positive
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col nicholson takes for his men,positive
the plot bypasses these risks,positive
that means the picture isnt perfect,positive
but it has a lot of virtues as well,positive
the bridge on the river kwai shows the madness of war and what it can produce in peoples minds,positive
it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others like shears get cynics,positive
and leans film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests,positive
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an antiwar film despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme,positive
david leans direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect,positive
his film is highly suspenseful especially in its dramatic if not wholly plausible showdown,positive
the film is also wellphotographed and has an apt score,positive
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character,positive
the other actors deliver fine performances as well,positive
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses,positive
c karl rackwitz klein k ris germany 1999,positive
martin scorseses triumphant adaptation of edith whartons the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life,positive
it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900s but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker,positive
this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorseses finest,positive
newland archer daylewis is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ryder a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful,positive
the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others,positive
on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may countess ellen olenska pfeiffer cousin of may walks into archers life,positive
archer is immediately captivated and finds himself in love with ellen,positive
archer is also bound by the limits of new york society which is an intrusive as any other in the world,positive
archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status,positive
the films subject matter may seem alien to scorsese but the theme is definitely not,positive
it is a theme of forbidden romance guilty pleasures and the consequences causes because of those actions,positive
there is a painstakingly flawed hero and his choice between the life he wants and the life he is destined for,positive
in truth it is a film about a society the audience doesnt know about but wants to find out more much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun,positive
the performances are absolutely breathtaking,positive
daylewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take,positive
pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well,positive
ryder is probably the gem of the group for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot and slowly pushes daylewis closer and closer to his eventual ending,positive
the supporting cast is also wonderful with several characters so singular that they are indelible in ones memory,positive
scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking,positive
his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight,positive
he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery,positive
his script is also excellent slow in buildup with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed,positive
it is difficult to make a period piece gripping scorsese however does it beautifully,positive
the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere,positive
he is patient but he films everything and anything remotely important,positive
the cameras sweep pan track and do more than theyve ever done but they are so subtle one doesnt realize hes watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing,positive
the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot but the viewer doesnt notice it because we want to see more of this gorgeous world,positive
there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding and joanne woodward narration is exquisite,positive
not a fast film like goodfellas this shares more in common with kundun than anything else,positive
and like kundun this is a slowstarting film that truly shines when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end,positive
a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
milos formans first film since the illfated valmont columbias the people vs,positive
larry flynt is a vastly entertaining if not particularly enlightening biopic of hustler publisher and selfmade millionaire larry flynt who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s,positive
the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order we open with young and dirtpoor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky,positive
cut to forward in time where the two flynt brothers now young men are running the struggling hustler gogo clubs in cincinnati,positive
the strip clubs are in a dire financial state and in a lastditch effort to salvage the operations flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter,positive
this evolved into the adult periodical hustler magazine creating larry flynt a vast financial empire and the rest is history,positive
what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt and his driven singleminded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression regardless of personal cost,positive
the people vs,positive
larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynts true love althea leasure whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations,positive
considering the serious nature of the films theme the importance of the united states first amendment the people vs,positive
larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully lighthearted and humourous,positive
much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynts outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances some of his chosen apparel is hilarious and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity,positive
the films focus is on the flynts many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech but the heart of the people vs,positive
larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea,positive
larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues but with althea we see his loving affectionate side,positive
theres a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking,positive
ultimately the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors but from the strength of flynt and altheas love for each other,positive
woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a careertopping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt,positive
harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience and a very compelling protagonist for the film,positive
courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn completely raw and impulsive,positive
its a very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love is extremely compelling its difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen and her chemistry with harrelson is deadon,positive
edward norton as flynts straight levelheaded lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier costars in the people vs,positive
larry flynt much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film,positive
one can sense the frustration that nortons character feels when harrelsons freetalking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind and this results in a heightened emotional punch when nortons isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges,positive
milos forman keeps the film moving although it runs over two hours it never drags and his direction of the film is very effective eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic,positive
theres also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot which is both clever and extremely entertaining,positive
two minor quibbles with the film it certainly seems like the people vs,positive
larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech,positive
consequently the first thirty minutes of the film introducing and setting up the characters seem unduly rushed perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion,positive
it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters the film clearly shows what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and on a superficial level some of their motivations but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level,positive
for example why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton president carters sister to be bornagain is a mystery to me,positive
then again perhaps it was to him as well,positive
these two points dont detract greatly from the film,positive
the people vs,positive
larry flynt is certainly among the very best studioreleased films of 1996 and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression and as a touching love story,positive
just how inseparable is the team of sgt,positive
martin riggs mel gibson and sgt,positive
roger murtaugh danny glover,positive
lets just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction his partner actually does it,positive
the familiar lethal weapon family is back including rene russo who is now the expectant mother of riggs child and joe pesci as the sopranalike foulmouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye,positive
new to the team is chris rock also a fasttalking up and coming detective,positive
trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go and in this film that is no exception,positive
even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship,positive
we here some ominous music which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen,positive
gunfire ensues and when its all over the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord,positive
although they dont know what theyre looking for their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action,positive
and theres plenty of action here for two movies,positive
led by fighting sensation jet li whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to,positive
li is ruthless in his approach will kill anyone just to make a point and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives,positive
there are terrific car chases explosions and gunshot galore,positive
its a summer action recipe followed to the letter and the result is nothing less than pure unadulterated summer fun,positive
but even too many explosions can get boring,positive
to counter that we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li,positive
luckily hed rather fight handtohand instead of firing off guns,positive
meanwhile when the detectives arent reloading their guns or running from fireballs theyre engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets,positive
everybody gets in on the shtick,positive
russo screams during her delivery the crime lord has a few funny bits when hes being interrogated while being given laughing gas and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones,positive
gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano,positive
score one for the old guard,positive
i love this movie and ive just seen for the umptenth time,positive
unfortunately it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it,positive
its my mission in life to spread the word see this movie,positive
fred george doug and howie are reaching middleage,positive
three of them have a wife kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay,positive
only fred is still a bachelor,positive
together they take the local train every morning to work in town,positive
on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress,positive
he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night,positive
since they always split everything four ways they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well kathy,positive
however kathy isnt completly honest to them,positive
in fact she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male,positive
with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper,positive
ok have one thing clear though,positive
the romantic rendezvous between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent,positive
the script stays above the waist or to be precise above the neck,positive
noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress the four guys call her their companion,positive
the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above 15 years but that only shows how long ago 1962 was,positive
small children could watch this without being corrupted,positive
kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student,positive
james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies,positive
i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife,positive
tony randall is funny as always,positive
1962 was more than 35 years ago,positive
how many accountants copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work,positive
this is the white middle class i cant remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use,positive
these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves,positive
perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology,positive
much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of lolita made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over its use of pedophilia and as such its important to address it straightforwardly before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years lying around in vaults san a distributor and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit,positive
when seeing this film after all the hoopla keeping in mind that there are people namely me who are fans of the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation well,positive
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution,positive
whats even worse is that seeing this lolita especially the first time and if youre familiar with anything lolita is admittingly very anticlimactic,positive
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it its really quite a film perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne although really look at its competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal at least besides jacobs ladder,positive
ive seen this lolita twice the first time i wasnt so blown away,positive
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting,positive
the second time not really thinking about how ive waited for what seems like forever to see it and how im seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre it really affected me emotionally,positive
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one which is why its such a good novel and why this is such a good film,positive
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14year old girl named dolores a k a lolita is great because its not trash for the perverted but because its about human obsession with things that are out of ones reach,positive
its protagonist the comicallynamed humbert humbert is not your average pedophile but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies,positive
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology something that will destroy us but that we cant live without,positive
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely but done in a way that is not heavyhanded at all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating,positive
the focus of this film and the reason for making it it seems was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images and scenes which are blatantly overstylized,positive
the tone of the book is a comical one but its also a tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blows every single thing out of perspective,positive
humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed,positive
we get a sense that perhaps its by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed,positive
he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14yearold love and allows himself to embody her as lolita,positive
he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions and by the end he has nothing but overlydramatic feelings for her,positive
the story recognizes the extreme of this almost out of a test seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions and perhaps bring them to peace,positive
the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey we can easily sympathize and even identify with him,positive
the opening and final images of the film are the same and who hasnt done a similar action that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us,positive
this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed in shock 1962 by stanley kubrick who couldnt possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do but did the next best thing he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general,positive
in that film he used the traps of society as benefits,positive
the studio demanded the final scene that of a heinous murder come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile and,positive
when you see it it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession,positive
the censors wouldnt allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decided to play it as comedy but still allow the tragedy to seep through,positive
looking at these two versions especially after reading the novel and we all know that when weve read a novel and see a film adaptation we are bound to be angered by any size differences its really impossible to compare them,positive
they both go for different things and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was,positive
and although its true that several scenes are similar and are thus up for comparison overall its unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse,positive
i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is and i wont say that here,positive
however this film is pretty amazing mostly because hey i loved the book and this film nearly reminded me of it,positive
it doesnt have nearly as much wit a couple comical scenes and even a lot of good chuckles but just not totally witty but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had,positive
some of that is in the casting of the two leads,positive
jeremy irons with his deep soft british voice and gentle look is an amazing humbert,positive
hes droll in a very unique way and well no one can look distraught the way he does,positive
he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience,positive
and when he looks at lolita with love and she looks at him with lust you know that hes her prisoner for as long as he lives,positive
and dominique swain who plays the title character is rather incredible,positive
she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction bratiness and selfcenteredness that marks the character,positive
its easy to see why she surrenders to humbert she loves the attention and knows that she can have her way with him at any time,positive
when he denies her something she blackmails him effortlessly a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic and when he stands up to her she weeps and runs away leaving humbert to follow her,positive
there are two other minor characters in the film one whos a road block in the beginning and the other whos a reappearing threat to the relationship,positive
the former is charlotte lolitas mother played by melanie griffith,positive
in the book charlotte is a monster of a woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overlyreligious and ultimately selfish,positive
and shes the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal at least in the beginning,positive
as played by shelly winters in the original she represented all these qualities as played by griffith here shes about half of them,positive
its annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first,positive
and even though griffith is not really bad persay shes nothing more,positive
the other is clare quilty the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita and succeeds but at a price,positive
langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original,positive
quilty was a comic character in the original a threat in the form of many forms popping in states of rambling german proning and eventually drunk,positive
langella takes the other route allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite of what we thought of him,positive
as you can see most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just parts of a whole new look at the novel at least cinemawise,positive
this version is beautiful and perpetually saddening,positive
the camera movements are stylized and each shot is breathtakingly rich,positive
the acting is for the most part wonderful and when we watch it we really get a sense that for humbert who is telling the story the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita,positive
more importantly it takes us right up the brink of emotion then jumps right over it,positive
by the end with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car following what he says is the only part of his life he doesnt regret we feel that we all lose to something we can never have,positive
after indecent proposal and up close and personal redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last,positive
redford may look great onscreen but over the past few years hes proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera,positive
ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteeneighties and it was the first picture he helmed,positive
while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magicrealism with um,positive
realism and ive never been much of a fan of a river runs through it to the chagrin of many quiz show was dazzling energetic and convincing,positive
the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that subgenre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery,positive
scottthomas plays annie maclean an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace johanssen loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi,positive
graces horse survived but barely and has gone mad,positive
annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery believing that if the horse heals it will mend graces newlybroken spirit,positive
eventually mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker redford a famed horse whisperer who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches leaving busy husband neill behind,positive
eventually they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of toms family and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana including naturally tom the wise and lonely trainer,positive
the horse whisperer is delicately made,positive
i dare say lyrical since to many peoples ear that word is synonymous with boring,positive
hardly,positive
the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch especially in the final third of the story,positive
scottthomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell especially since d p,positive
robert richardsons photography casts montana as heaven on earth,positive
a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana,positive
the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt emotive performance as the niceguy husband who is as authoritive and likeable as tom,positive
he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a shortcut for explaining away the cheating spouses motivation,positive
unfortunately one of the horse whisperers only flaws is the chemistry between wouldbe lovers scottthomas and redford,positive
i liked both of them but i didnt necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish even if the countryside air thawed her slightly,positive
luckily and curiously this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesnt quite mattertheir adultery seems like an afterthought the obligatory subplot that ties many of the characters complex relationships together,positive
the rich mans wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double where the story and characters are so onedimensional and contrived that you know you shouldnt be enjoying yourself,positive
but somehow the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things,positive
not that its bad its just that its been done before and better in my opinion,positive
i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre but its probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet striving helplessly to get out and instead of just flushing him you end up kind of rooting for the little guy,positive
thats basically how i felt about this movie,positive
i mean its not very good but its not completely bad either,positive
the wife of the title is josie potenza played nicely by halle berry,positive
she is married to tony christopher mcdonald you,positive
know the guy who looks like joe piscapo a really stressedout businessman who drinks way to much and doesnt give josie the attention she deserves cough cough,positive
thus she is driven into the arms of another man jake golden clive owen,positive
near the beginning of the film josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods,positive
once there however tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details im still not quite sure what line of work hes in,positive
making the best of her situation josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars,positive
one night she meets a stranger named cole peter greene finally getting a meaty role,positive
they have dinner together and eventually both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal,positive
after learning that she is not happily married cole offers to take care of the problem,positive
managing to escape from the psychotic maniac josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband,positive
but then one night cole shows up,positive
and here is where the fun begins,positive
from this point on its going to be a noholds barred clichefest ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects,positive
this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out,positive
and for the most part theyre right the rich mans wife has nary one original bone in its body,positive
but who cares,positive
if youre looking for good ol dumb suspense movie you cant do much better than this,positive
and if you suspense buffs arent already sold it has a killer of an ending too,positive
plot a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side,positive
but this new guy is not like all the others hes got ambition hes got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster,positive
violence lots of swearing and betrayals ensue,positive
critique a very good seriousminded unique british gangster flick which misses the great mark by way of an annoying voiceover popping up throughout the film and a soso ending,positive
heres yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix,positive
okay so its not entirely new but its definitely original when all put together as done here,positive
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place,positive
its 1968 and these dudes are looking good,positive
yes its all about the suits fellas the,positive
italian shoes the cufflinks the ties and the birds thats ladies for those uninitiated hanging around you,positive
here are a bunch of horrible men gangsters if you will looking sharp talking shit and busting heads all over the place,positive
but thats not the basis of this movie,positive
the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group the excellent david thewlis and one of his cronies paul bettany also extremely good in this film and how the power sex appeal and coolness of one affects the other,positive
you know how there are always these hangeron gangster types who latch on to the godfathers the leaders the top dogs of every crime organization,positive
well most of the time these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person that,positive
is their boss,positive
so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence,positive
but this film brings the betrayals the messed up loyalties the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package,positive
of course director paul mcguigan isnt trying to be guy ritchie here and doesnt overstylize his presentation jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix,positive
nope he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this,positive
the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which hes attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty,positive
look into my eyes,positive
in fact the last time that ive seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers millers crossing,positive
scary shite,positive
but theres an ever better scene than that in this film,positive
this one features bettany once again slowly torturing hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster from that mans pointofview but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes one by one thats right he does the guy in his underwear,positive
that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman,positive
but the flicks not perfect,positive
in fact i didnt mind malcolm mcdowells voiceover narration at first but as the film grew into a major flashback most of the film is presented as such he came in every now and then and rarely added anything of interest to the plot,positive
all he seemed to do was swear and call people the cword umpteen times and even described one scene as it was happening so,positive
i opened the door then went up the lift etc its,positive
like yeah i know that already i could see it on the screen,positive
overdone,positive
i also didnt quite buy the ending of the movie which despite being original seemed a little unbelievable especially when you consider that its supposed to be taking place 30 years later and folks still seem to be holding grudges still in love still living in the same apartments,positive
i mean cmon its 30 years man,positive
i dont know somehow it didnt work all that well for me,positive
but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies and this one is a decent addition to the lot,positive
forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowells narration of the obvious plot points and concentrate on the films stronger attributes such as its style the exquisite atmosphere of the time period its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads bettany and thewlis,positive
incidentally unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films its the real deal,positive
note this film is packed with strong accents all around which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time,positive
its also quite violent and i dont remember any film that used the cword as much as this one so leave the kids at home for this one,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive

veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime his latest directorial effort,positive
when steve everett his newest character gets angry at someone he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear whos just lost his cubs,positive
eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time but everett could just take the cake,positive
he gets my vote at least partly because ev is a drunken affairaweek womanizer who has many relationship problems very few of which are with his wife diane venora,positive
when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies everett must take over for her at a vital interview session,positive
the interview is with frank beacham isaiah washington a deathrow inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk,positive
eastwood furrows his brow,positive
as everett gradually finds information he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent,positive
he interviews a key witness michael jeter who claims that he burst in the door at pocums foods because his car had overheated only to see beacham standing over the dead womans body blood on his suspenders gun in hand,positive
but everett protests how could he have seen the gun which was lowered by his side with the potato chip rack in front of him,positive
jeter doesnt know what hes talking about,positive
eastwood furrows his brow,positive
crinkled expressions and all clint is the centre of energy of true crime,positive
the film is by no means a standard yarn but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shootouts,positive
isaiah washington has a breakout performance as frank beacham and scenes with him and his weary wife lisa gay hamilton are truly heartfelt moments,positive
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him,positive
denis leary as everetts editor and boss has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger you see ev is sleeping with his wife,positive
but hands down the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera,positive
playing the big boss alan mann woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laughoutloud punchlines,positive
when true crime opts for a highspeed chase to the governers house at the finale the quality of filmmaking takes an abrupt nosedive,positive
eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didnt need to switch lanes,positive
true crime is a tensionbuilding intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star,positive
this is a road block he could have easily dismissed i furrow my brow,positive
in brief best bleak comedy film since heathers,positive
full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture,positive
go see it,positive
so i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on hard copy with pam smart the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980s,positive
hard copy s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidmans fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for,positive
smart replied that she thought kidmans character came off as a dumb vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal,positive
smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband,positive
smarts got a point,positive
it wouldnt be the first time that the public took the better scripted and wellacted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version,positive
however given a choice between the mass media happening of the real event and the fictionalized movie i would definitely opt for the later,positive
real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart while pretty and alluring is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman,positive
to die for begins in a town called little hope new hampshire the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb,positive
the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being on tv,positive
of course one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry played by matt dillon,positive
but with a little imagination some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement our heroine manages to overcome the naysayers in her life at least temporarily,positive
kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne,positive
i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture,positive
her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates,positive
kidman knows a starmaking role when she sees it and she plays the consciencedeprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven postfeminist ubertemptress from hell,positive
she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way,positive
at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sisterinlaw,positive
you know she knowingly exclaims gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head,positive
her husband beams at suzannes profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters,positive
this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven folks,positive
the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix,positive
he plays jimmy a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzannes sexual favors,positive
kidmans character vapid though she is is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland,positive
phoenix looks like the very embodiment of genx slackerhood as envisioned by tabloid tv of course,positive
his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he aint going anywhere ever,positive
phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne someone who actually noticed him,positive
gus van sant drugstore cowboy my own private idaho direction is firstrate,positive
he keeps the pacing in this notquitethriller snapping along,positive
van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesnt stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions,positive
van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to get it without stopping to explain what is funny about this allamerican story,positive
the screenplay by buck henry is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines ive heard since heathers,positive
henrys story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters,positive
henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny miniclassic,positive
danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands,positive
either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trickortreat parties,positive
allinall a wonderful production well worth your seven bucks,positive
to die for a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant,positive
written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman matt dillon joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard,positive
rated r for language and mature themes,positive
respect the r not for under 14s rating stars,positive
go see it,positive
most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy,positive
rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category but manages to be slightly unique,positive
the rocky formula of rocky loses wins fight is carried out to the letter,positive
also the tradition of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well,positive
this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky sylvester stallone has become,positive
even showing a brief appearance on sesame street,positive
then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips hulk hogan,positive
a mysterious badass known as clubber lang mr t trashtalks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he pities the fool for not coming out and fighting him outright,positive
rockys trainer burgess meredith tells rocky not to fight but the italian stallion doesnt listen,positive
naturally he gets his ass kicked,positive
somewhere along the line after this several things happen,positive
rockys longtime trainer dies causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed,positive
rockys wife complains to her husband that he should fight,positive
the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky,positive
guess who wins,positive
the winners name rhymes with smocky,positive
the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber langs over the top performance,positive
the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film,positive
which is good if you like fighting scenes,positive
the last match is quite decent actually,positive
if you liked the previous films rent this one,positive
its well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series,positive
but if you cant stand rocky shouting adrianne,positive
one more time see something else,positive
every year hollywood crowns a new it boy a young actor pegged for major movie stardom,positive
inheriting the mantle from last years winner matthew mcconaughey is matt damon and like mcconaughey he proves to be more than just a fresh young face as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in releasejohn grishams the rainmaker and good will hunting,positive
damon has his first major starring role a la mcconaughey in a john grisham adaptationin this case francis ford coppolas take on the rainmaker,positive
damon plays wetbehindtheears attorney rudy baylor who immediately after passing the bar exam finds himself representing the mother mary kay place of a terminally ill young man john whitworth in a bigleague suit against a negligent insurance company,positive
while rudys and the films main concern is this case he also finds time to protect a young wife claire danes from her abusive husband melrose placer andrew shue in a mercifully brief role,positive
written for the screen and directed by coppola the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously,positive
coppolas most notableand effectivecontribution to the triedandtrue grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself which largely comes in the presence of danny devito as rudys unlicensed cocounsel and golden globe nominee jon voight as the insurance companys hotshot attorney,positive
the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous but danes is as superb as always,positive
then of course there is damon who nicely juggles the weighty the insurance case the spousal abuse and the humorous rudys often comical naivete requirements of his role without missing a beat,positive
as good as he is in the rainmaker damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself,positive
damon plays the title character will hunting a troubled young construction at mit who also happens to be a supergenius,positive
in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction an mit math professor stellan skarsgard taps his old college friend community college psychologist sean mcguire robin williams to counsel the abrasive standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life,positive
good will hunting is the touchyfeely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damons intelligent script touches,positive
even though no one and if so very few people can directly relate to wills burden of superhuman intelligence the insecurities he suffers are universal,positive
the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors,positive
williams delivers a nice dramatic turn affleck a hot upandcoming actor himself chasing amy turns up in a warm and charming performance as wills best friend and the everappealing minnie driver shines as wills harvardschooled love interest,positive
the clear standout in the cast though is damon who bravely does not soften wills prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard not to care for him,positive
so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine but based on his impressive work in john grishams the rainmaker and especially good will hunting it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come,positive
the end of the affair is a dark and moody romantic period piece that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs,positive
although its slow and sometimes confusing to follow it still manages to give audiences a moving experience,positive
based on graham greenes novel of the same name the film mainly follows 3 characters,positive
theres maurice bendrix ralph fiennes who has an affair with henry miles stephen rea wife sarah julianne moore,positive
sarah finds henry to be a bore because well hes just a normal guy,positive
its all work and no play with him,positive
while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah and would do anything for her,positive
unfortunately the two break up,positive
this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks so that leads us to the present,positive
its a few years later and they both still think of each other so maurice hires a private detective ian hart to see what sarah is up too,positive
while this may sound straight forward its not,positive
its a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men unhappiness and the ever lasting love,positive
all this may sound like a drag but it really captures your interest,positive
with great performances by ralph fiennes doing another english patient type of film only this movie is better and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 i believe this was the role she had the most passion for and you can see why,positive
the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan,positive
even though i didnt read the book theres no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive,positive
whats so moving about it you ask,positive
the tragedy of it all,positive
its not the typical romance in which a guy finds a girl they fall in love and all is well this is more complicated and depressing,positive
it really shows the complexity of a relationship because nothing is ever perfect,positive
everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces,positive
back to neil jordans script it wasnt only red roses,positive
there were times when i felt it too be a little slow but most romances are,positive
it also tended to be a bit confusing especially at the start,positive
it keep jumping around from past to present so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things,positive
also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan,positive
id have to say this is his finest achievement to date because quite frankly ive never really found his work to be up to par,positive
it just never did anything for me until now,positive
when it ends it leaves viewers a little saddened but provoked nonetheless,positive
this is definitely one of the best films of 99 and had some of the best acting most notably by moore,positive
not for all movie goers but for those who are film buffs and want something of value,positive
plot a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon to whom hes devoted a tribute band in which he sings gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place,positive
critique im a sucker for movies like this,positive
a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams works hard devotes the time the energy and the patience and ultimately hits it bigtime,positive
in the case of this film our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it yup luck always finds its way into these types of equations although generally tied very closely to hard work they need a new singer,positive
his entry and adaptation to the whole rock n roll lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch,positive
although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love or past love of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it,positive
metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isnt that prominent anymore i still check out my motley crue twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again,positive
thats not to say that you wont like this film if you dont like the music but the music and live performances from the band play a big part in the movie and i for one had a blast watching and listening to it all,positive
but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg,positive
wow hand this fella some major props as he totally becomes this heavy metal incidentally metal god was the films original title and a much better one if you ask me,positive
he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through,positive
he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams,positive
aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend and the romance angle between them was sweet but she didnt pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes,positive
i was also impressed by some of the real musicians who played in the film zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne jeff pilson from dokken stephan jenkins from third eye blind blas elias from slaughter but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members,positive
its to note that this film was based on a reallife tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer their original singer also admitted to being gay as in this film,positive
just for the record im certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies but because its a fun uplifting wellpaced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances,positive
oh yeah and for those who dig the heavier side of music the soundtrack also rocks,positive
you see dreams,positive
can come true,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
almost famous 810 blow 810 boogie nights 910 detroit rock city 810 girlfight 610 goodfellas 1010,positive
so here is the second of 1999s remakes of classic horror movies,positive
the first was the dumb pathetic but ok remake of the classic the haunting,positive
now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill,positive
the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 000 to stay in his house,positive
if they survive the night they get the money,positive
if not well you get the jurisdiction,positive
having not yet seen the film dvd on its way i wasnt sure if i would really like the remake,positive
but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on,positive
geoffrey rush in a fantastic role with an incredible performance is steven price the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people,positive
his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends,positive
steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list,positive
somehow someone or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party,positive
eddie taye diggs an exbaseball player sarah ali carter an exassistant who can rewire anything melissa brigette wilson a talkshow host in sorts dr blackburn peter ghallager and watson chris kattan a smartmouthed humorist in ways,positive
what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 000 000 dollars if they can survive through the night,positive
if they can they get the money if not well they dont,positive
the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum,positive
years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr there forcing him to lock the place up because if he died so did they,positive
everyone who was in there burned to death,positive
now it is steven prices home and he is throwing this party for these five people,positive
what starts out as a seemingly normal night turns into a horrifying blood splattering night,positive
the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed,positive
onebyone the people start to disappear,positive
conspiracies start to turn up and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all,positive
the people find rooms which once held mental patients,positive
rooms which once had people dying,positive
rooms which may still contain these people,positive
now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house and they must survive each other with terrorfying results,positive
since i officially havent seen the original i cant say which is better,positive
i can say however i liked this movie,positive
geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price and does a great job doing a vincent price role,positive
famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times,positive
ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs,positive
chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines,positive
peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims,positive
the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing,positive
the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy and even sometimes downright scary,positive
i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous,positive
one thing i knew not to expect was a haunting type movie with special effects galore,positive
even though it had fantastic gore and special effects the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget which doesns show all the way through but you can tell,positive
the movie was written well and its only major flaw is the underdeveloped characters and plot holes that we are left with,positive
the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it,positive
i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise,positive
i was expecting another haunting with special effects no scares and a dumb ending,positive
instead i found a good halloween movie with gore scares and great acting,positive
house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really cant take seriously,positive
though it is a wellmade movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws,positive
but besides that the movie is fun smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this cant be made all the time,positive
jerry springer has got nothing on wild things,positive
john mcnaughtons new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springers notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks bisexuality threesomes poolside catfights slutty rich bimbos even redneck gatorwrestling theyre all part of the movies raucous complex storyline,positive
but even trash tv topicality cant drag wild things down this crazy campfest plays like something youd find latenight on the usa network only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast,positive
despite a smattering of needless scenes most of them sexual in nature theres wicked fun to be had here,positive
wild things would be a guilty pleasure only theres no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it,positive
high school guidance counselor sam lombardo matt dillon is wellliked in the town of blue bay especially by pretty popular kelly van ryan denise richards whose family name is among the florida yachting enclaves most financially prominent,positive
hoping to take her crush to a physical level kelly seductively slinks into lombardos house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser but the very next day tearfully admits to her trollop mother theresa russell that she was raped,positive
before long blue bay detectives ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubinvega are listening to similar allegations from kellys rebel classmate suzie toller neve campbell,positive
lombardo who maintains his innocence hires neck bracesporting opportunistic lawyer ken bowden bill murray to defend him in court,positive
the previews give away the following revelations so if you havent seen any of the movies spots on the television or in the theater you might want to skip to the next paragraph,positive
while crossexamining suzie on the witness stand bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her,positive
to pay lombardo for the damages kellys mother breaks her daughters trust fund and gives him 8 5 million,positive
but lombardo kelly and suzie are actually all working together and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can,positive
duquette and perez however begin to suspect that theres more afoot to the case than just false accusations,positive
if theres a major drawback to wild things its that its oversexed to a fault,positive
the muchtalkedabout hotel room menageatrois between dillon campbell and richards is a turnoff,positive
its also cut short sorry guys and should have been cut shorter the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often,positive
what we dont see is far more effective than what we do,positive
another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene,positive
er no thanks,positive
also bacons duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten,positive
daphne rubinvega from broadways rent tries to compensate for a superfluous character,positive
theresa russell is just plain wooden,positive
and when in the end all is out in the open ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary,positive
but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises some predictable some not that never seems to end,positive
wild things has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews and most are so gleefully overthetop nasty that you cant help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship,positive
a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent murrays a stitch especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardos case and flipping them off,positive
and dont leave when the closing credits hit the screen or youll miss the films best part four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell,positive
speaking of bombshells denise richards who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in starship troopers,positive
matt dillon flexes his sleepyvoiced sex appeal and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision,positive
neve campbell lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio,positive
reedited and toned down a bit the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths,positive
but what were given works well enough,positive
wild things is highly entertaining and indeed very wild,positive
in chocolat a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures patterns and lines hoping shell be able to foresee the kind of chocolate theyll most enjoy,positive
some scoff the idea but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before,positive
this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole on the surface it appears to be a light fluffy fable with no depth or true worth but when one takes a second deeper look chocolats true colors begin to shine through,positive
making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it lasse hallstroms chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously craftednot to mention one of the best films of the year,positive
what gives chocolat its magic much like hallstroms 1999 winner of two academy awards the cider house rules is its willingness to say whats on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences,positive
the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrowmindedness,positive
chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet where majority rules and the majority lives by only one law religion,positive
the bulk of the townspeople with few exceptions are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly nonreligious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouthwatering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens,positive
many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by viannes opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent especially the mayor comte de reynaud a cartoonlike alfred molina who will stop at nothing to put her out of business,positive
on the other hand the shop is a delight to others including the cranky armande voizin judi dench who sits day by day in viannes shop telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson aurelien parentkoening which comes as a result of his mother carrieann moss believing armande is a bad influence as she does not hold the same strict religious beliefs that she does,positive
also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat whose husband is constantly beating her to whom vianne offers a home and befriends,positive
juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne genuinely capturing her characters determination to turn the narrowminded townspeople into more happy independent human beings but most of chocolats success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses,positive
lena olin previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 deserves her second nomination for her earnest moving portrayal of a lost scared woman torn between staying true to her battering manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs,positive
judi dench is sharp incisive and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin,positive
carrie annmoss in what is likely to be her first largely noticed and acclaimed role since the matrix shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously,positive
victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk a young girl hoping her alwaysonthemove mother will eventually settle down,positive
a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline five extraordinary women one extraordinary movie,positive
thats not to say the men dont do their share though alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist hugh oconor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne,positive
the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film,positive
cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric fairy tale look to the film and rachel portmans masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules,positive
chocolat adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel is a wonderful little treat of a film one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter,positive
while not as powerful as the cider house rules lasse hallstroms chocolat is a film which works on all levelsas a drama a comedy a fable a romance and a fairy tale,positive
and it even lives up to its name it is delicious to savor the taste of easy to digest and like all excellent chocolate it is memorable for days afterward,positive
the bottom line chocolat is pure pleasure,positive
in present day hanoi three sisters reflect on their parents relationship while trying to define their own in tran anh hungs the scent of green papaya the vertical ray of the sun,positive
youngest sister lien tran nu yenkhe greets the day with hai ngo quanq hai the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with,positive
their morning ritual of tai chi and lou reed precedes crossing the street to eldest sister suongs nguyen nhu quynh cafe where lien works for breakfast,positive
the three sisters lovingly prepare their mothers memorial banquet of traditional delicacies prepared as much for look as taste while giggling over the differences between the sexes,positive
after the family breaks from the banquet we learn that suongs young son little monkey is doted upon but theres a distance developing with her husband quoc chu ngoc hung whos leaving for one of his habitual botanical photography trips,positive
middle sister khanh tran manh cuong tells her writer husband shes pregnant before he leaves on a trip to saigon to research tuan a mysterious man in his motherinlaws past,positive
lien keeps crawling into hais bed at night causing him to fall out of it,positive
the initial serenity we witnessed starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month later as the three women prepare their fathers memorial banquet,positive
the vertical ray of the sun is a contemplative piece where strong passions exist underneath calm exteriors,positive
sly humor self deceit and harsh truths all exist in the cyclic screenplay,positive
tran anh hung and his cinematographer mark lee pingbin flowers of shanghai linger over and repeat the small gestures of everyday life a wife washes her husbands hands a woman makes water dance in a bowl a man pulls his lover to face him before they part,positive
small spaces such as rooms alleys and courtyards create intimacy,positive
the color green symbolizing life and tranquility is used heavily in the films visual styling lapsing into yellowish hues and blues,positive
tran anh hungs film recalls ang lees eat drink man woman another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together traditionally for a parent,positive
but while lees more traditionally storydriven film resulted in radical changes for all concerned the vertical ray of the suns characters strive for peaceful harmony,positive
watching it is like trailing your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day,positive
defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writerdirector albert brooks who also stars in the comedy,positive
after dying in a car crash on his birthday of all days brooks wakes up in judgement city a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings,positive
brooks has five days to convince two judges that hes worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence,positive
enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant,positive
during his trial brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant,positive
its impossible to resist chuckling and cringing at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth,positive
torn in particular is in vintage comic form and he walks away with the picture,positive
the movie also features meryl streep appealing as the loveinterest and shirley maclaine who pops up in a hilarious cameo,positive
while the film is uneven many of its gags are price less,positive
take for example the food in judgement city its always the most delicious youve ever tasted,positive
and its also caloriefreeso chow down,positive
when star wars came out some twenty years ago the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image,positive
when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars we see constellations meteor showers and cool spaceships,positive
when han solo goes light speed the stars change to bright lines going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point,positive
cool,positive
october sky offers a much simpler imagethat of a single white dot traveling horizontally across the night sky,positive
was it really only forty years ago when sputnik was launched and that before then no satellites ever existed,positive
have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a thentechnological achievement even though it was from the russians,positive
it sounds hokey but when that scene occurs near the beginning of october sky i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam played by jake gyllenhaal,positive
determined to make a dent in the space race he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them,positive
it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket,positive
when lovely teacher miss riley played by laura dern suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair we know exactly who is going to win,positive
but the joy in a film like this is in the little details,positive
for example homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class,positive
if he has any strengths whatsoever it is an undeterring vision and a good organizer,positive
it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school who knows more about rocket science than he does,positive
it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property that is the entire coalmining town he must walk eight miles one way just to set up the rockets which will fail fail fail and fail again,positive
homers dad is played by chris cooper a favorite actor of mine since lone star,positive
here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in matewan instead of organizing union rallies he is the head of the coalminers who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions,positive
this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year note how multidimensional his character is,positive
he is his sons last nemesis as one who most likely interferes with his sons dreams,positive
but he truly loves his son and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how,positive
through coalmining,positive
because of his character we can see how far weve come,positive
the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us,positive
we dont understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family,positive
the paradigm was shifting under the fathers feet and he knew of no other life,positive
so october sky far from being merely a feelgood inspirational film offers much food for thought,positive
and this is the best type of inspirational film the one that you take something with you,positive
btw the final image of the film is just as simple is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontalmoving white dot against the nightsky background,positive
another commonplace image to be sure but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago,positive
capsule this is a film that avoids easy answers,positive
wilhelm furtwangler then the worlds greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis,positive
what were his views was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter,positive
how much did he know about crimes against humanity,positive
the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation,positive
high 2 4 to 4,positive
in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabos sunshine a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes hungarian aristocrats nazis and communists,positive
szabos followup film a german production is much more limited in scope,positive
it is about the postwar investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them,positive
ronald harwoods screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich,positive
maj steve arnold played by harvey keitel has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler stellan skarsgard perhaps europes greatest classical music conductor,positive
when other artists fled germany furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen,positive
after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes,positive
he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty,positive
from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra,positive
as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation,positive
there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting,positive
perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed,positive
if so perhaps he can never come to the truth,positive
in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler,positive
where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous,positive
it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act,positive
when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation,positive
perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is,positive
we are given clues to something but they are never tied up,positive
in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler,positive
the film is basically a stage play,positive
the visual is not very important,positive
corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location,positive
as with a stage play what this film centers on the dialog and that is intriguing,positive
i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice,positive
at one point we clearly see arnolds desk calendar say jan 16 tues,positive
a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951,positive
the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947,positive
a possible date could be obtained from any world almanac,positive
a breed apart casts rutger hauer as a crazy birdloving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner,positive
a bit hard to swallow,positive
thats only the first of many improbabilities in this film,positive
hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector,positive
turner is the woman caught between the two men,positive
a breed apart isnt a bad movie exactly,positive
indeed i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters even though their goals couldnt be more different,positive
the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies,positive
for example early on in the film hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at his birds,positive
later on the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people and hauer kills a few of them,positive
i have a tough time believing that the police wouldnt get involved at that point,positive
another problem is the silly lovetriangle that develops,positive
i didnt care one way or the other who ended up with turner,positive
i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions,positive
however despite this uninteresting subplot turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes theres more to life than money and birds,positive
as for hauer hes an actor ive always admired,positive
he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters,positive
and this one is no exception,positive
hes frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse wearing pirates clothing and holstering a crossbow,positive
despite all his eccentric mannerisms though hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through,positive
for example theres a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early,positive
he comes off as crazy loner in that scene but a few minutes later he is apologizing to turner and we believe his intentions,positive
soon after we find out hes a vietnam vet and his actions become fairly clear to us,positive
a breed apart isnt a great movie by any means but it does contain good performances by all three leads and its worth seeing for that reason alone,positive
no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordans harrowing humorous horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabes novel about young lad francie bradys eamonn owens descent into madness in 1960s ireland,positive
on one hand it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs nugent fiona shaw,positive
on another hand i found it difficult to laugh at some of francies darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick needy child having been raised by a drunken father stephen rea and a suicidal mother aisling osullivan,positive
on yet another hand i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his for lack of a better word bad deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them,positive
however the butcher boys power is undeniable and the film as a whole is unforgettableperhaps because it is so disturbing,positive
what makes it so unsettling is the francies overall winkwink yet matteroffact attitude about everything expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie rea again,positive
think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs and youll sort of understand,positive
anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens love francie or hate him you cannot take your eyes off of owens,positive
the butcher boy truly is a twisted unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable,positive
in the lobby after the screening i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust that movie was so unfunny,positive
i didnt know what to expect,positive
its like something you chase for so long but then you dont know how to react when you get it,positive
i still dont know how to react,positive
michael jordan on winning his first nba championship in 1991 or,positive
my thoughts after meeting him on november 21 1997,positive
rebel without a cause is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to,positive
everyone feels that they are different in some way that they dont belong in some places and rebel without a cause successfully shows on screen these universal emotions,positive
no matter what generation you belong to these feelings are present,positive
this is why james dean is admired by america because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute,positive
in our minds we just try to do the right thing just like deans jim stark does,positive
not only does rebel without a cause display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure,positive
each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection,positive
this is because times change and in response people change,positive
no matter how popular you were once as your generation grows older newer breeds look at you in a different light,positive
this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents,positive
even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past the teens could not believe this,positive
in one humorous scene stark his girlfriend judy natalie wood and his pal plato sal mineo pretend they are adults,positive
they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored,positive
this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another,positive
speaking on behalf of my generation i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by,positive
the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation same,positive
goes for brando redford even deniro,positive
i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon ben affleck and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century,positive
will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten,positive
any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film,positive
even if rebel without a cause has some ridiculous scenes the game of chicken did people really act this way an unbelievable conclusion how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end and a silly romance wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours it still is a fabulous film,positive
the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool,positive
now however the coolness is fading,positive
bob the happy bastards quickie review,positive
rush hour,positive
so whats the problem with 48 hours clones these days,positive
they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had,positive
that was the problem that plagued these clones not to mention the actual sequel another 48 hours a complete waste of film,positive
but at last someone has a different take on the matter and its director brett rainer,positive
rush hour features jackie chan in his first u s action movie playing a chinese detective whos being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulates daughter,positive
of course the fbi is upset that hell be interfering in their investigation and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth of course thats chris tucker,positive
what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker,positive
tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity im michael jackson you tito and chan delivers a few zingers of his own as well as some terrific fight scenes,positive
the storys pretty much your average fare but with a decent twist involving the main villain a highly clouded figure named jun tao,positive
at least its entertaining and the concept is excellently realized,positive
a particular fight scene in a chinese office where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys is funny and energetic at the same time,positive
and the finales a real treat as well chan,positive
delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10story drop,positive
rush hour is just the sort of film youll get a kick out of on any night of the week,positive
just make sure you dont look for anything culturally different and youll be fine drunken master ii this aint,positive
maybe the most important thing about this movie is that its not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker broadcasted on abc on a monday night starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth respectively,positive
because its not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why its so great,positive
underneath the todiefor cinematography the brilliant acting and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it tell it in a certain original way,positive
it doesnt merely go from plot point to plot point,positive
it goes from character to character,positive
it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all and makes the story of a worldreknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters both musicians who have a totally unique relationship,positive
its that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this unlike patch adams effortlessly emotional and real,positive
in short this movie is just awesome,positive
it merely tells its story really well and thats something that just has to be commended these days when most stories are botched because theyre not told by great storytellers,positive
director anand tucker tells this story well,positive
he overdramaticizes everything but still keeps it real,positive
the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr rachel griffiths and emily watson respectively two sisters who are first seen in childhood played by auriol evans and keely flanders respectively as the very best of friends,positive
they are also both musicians hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist and when it all begins both are considered child prodigies but hilary is seen as the better of the two,positive
jackie a bit jealous works and works at her playing skills and soon the tables are turned,positive
when they both hit adulthood hilary strives for a comeback while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world but instead of fame captures the heart of a hapless joyful conductor kiffer finzi david morissey in a semistarmaking turn,positive
they marry after a short courtship and move to a lovely country house making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life when she plays she has the eyes of the world but when she stops shes alone,positive
she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist daniel barenboim james frain in hopes that she may overcloud her sister but she eventually begins to lose it and runs away to hilarys country home where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure,positive
its all terribly melodramtic as you can see and by the time jackie has contracted ms in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semismiliar shine in technical and emotional devastation it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadnt been handled in such a way,positive
the key thing here is that its not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that its about her tumultuous relationship with her sister which i might add is perfectly realized,positive
their relationship is the most downtoearth complex entity of the year they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world but theyre also completely jealous of one another,positive
when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities she tries in vain to make a comeback but cant and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success,positive
when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that ive ever seen in a film only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man,positive
and the whole time their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested,positive
another thing i really liked is emily watsons performance,positive
i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease or any combination of the three,positive
my reasoning for this is that its a fucking easy job,positive
the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in beloved sure shes good but whats so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around slurs her words together and acts like a three year old inside a 20year olds body,positive
hell i could play that if i had a pair of breasts,positive
in that same exact movie though is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane her brothers run off never to be seen again and her mothers lover is scared off,positive
she has to actually deal with real emotions something much harder than mere stumbling about,positive
but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons,positive
if you dont believe me look at jack nicholsons performance in as good as it gets great performance but easy job,positive
this isnt so for watson though because her insanity comes from real emotions not just a plot point,positive
and thanks to the opening sequence where we see her and hilary as kids we understand the motives behind all her actions and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life weve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses,positive
rachel griffiths who would have otherwise been the understudy to watsons protagonist actually matches watson stepforstep because as watson grows insane and demands unspeakable things from her griffiths holds her own and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her,positive
griffiths an otherwise unknown actress and watson being famous from breaking the waves and the boxer is absolutely brilliant just as absolutely brilliant as watson is and if the academy and all the other critics groups whove already deemed watsons performance the best of the year glance over hers because shes the one who doesnt get to go insane read she gets the boring role then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me,positive
after all griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real the tom cruise role in rainman the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman,positive
she does and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year its griffiths,positive
together the two actresses work extremely well though and both have to go through deep emotional hell the likes of which havent been seen this year,positive
if it hadnt been for an otherwise nottotallygreat final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety id say this is one of the top ten best films of the year,positive
its so close to perfection in its structure its treatment of its subject and its beautiful technical specifications cinematography nomination without a shred of doubt in my mind and maybe film editing that its nearly a shame that its not the flawless gem that it should be,positive
but hey as it is i can hardly complain,positive
in some regards making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it,positive
try too hard and it snaps but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther,positive
in simon birch director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique he takes advantage of caution and poise but also risks his movie with a few bold steps,positive
in the end hes not only holding an unbroken band but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature,positive
theres no doubt about it the film that johnson has crafted is rich,positive
he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown maine leaves turn bright orange in the fall the grass is a lush green pure white snow falls in the winter and the sky goes on forever,positive
the characters continue that turn our two leads are simon birch ian michael smith and joe wenteworth joseph mazzello,positive
simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital and by age twelve hes only two feet tall,positive
joe is the bastard son of rebecca ashley judd and by age twelve hes ready to know who is father is,positive
naturally the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball,positive
in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith simon birch is convinced that hes gods instrument and there must be a reason hes so small,positive
joe doesnt quite buy it but he sticks by simon the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each others only true friends,positive
early on the two meet up with ben goodrich oliver platt rebeccas new boyfriend and although the bond isnt immediate ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other,positive
both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability,positive
the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon a testament to the acting jobs of both,positive
finally jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show,positive
mark steven johnsons sense of drama and writing is fantastic,positive
the script is loosely based on john irvings novel a prayer for owen meany but its so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from based on to suggested by,positive
along those same lines its almost unfitting to compare the two johnson uses tension humor atmosphere and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions,positive
by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks but the winning idea remains the same,positive
simon birch is a different look at a different life and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come,positive
in the present however its an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at,positive
disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched,positive
to see a disaster film with actual originality or at least a decent plot twist would definitely be a welcome surprise,positive
unfortunately folks its not likely,positive
dantes peak is cliched and at times corny but also pretty decent,positive
to be honest i wasnt very interested in seeing this film and word of mouth as well as several reviews didnt make it sound promising,positive
so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasnt bad at all,positive
its pretty run of the mill but its not something i would say is merely ok to watch,positive
in case you dont know dantes peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in its shadow dantes peak who wouldve guessed eh,positive
pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future,positive
due to the lack of more substantial evidence nobody warns the small town and when they finally do its in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows,positive
brosnan all around good guy will of course save the day,positive
or at least the mayor of dantes peak linda hamilton,positive
naturally the two will become infatuated with one another,positive
if you think i just ruined a plot development you havent seen very many movies,positive
theres also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings,positive
and of course the kids or the dog at least one or the other will do something heroic,positive
but hey i dont want to ruin all the surprises,positive
if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dantes peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself,positive
its not brain food but it succeeds at what its meant to be,positive
an enjoyable suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash,positive
a lot of times a threestar film will be my favorite,positive
theyre usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too,positive
theyre usually not too deep allowing for semibrainless relaxation and at the same time not too dumb,positive
men in black is a fourstar threestar film,positive
hope you could follow that one,positive
men in black doesnt wait to get to the fun,positive
just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay tommy lee jones introduced to an alien and introduced to the the awesome memorydiminishing tool that all mib agents use,positive
after all you cant have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you,positive
men in black is of course the organization which moniters all extraterrestrial activity on earth,positive
nypd officer james edwards will smith is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the nogood punk hes chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes,positive
the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end and with that dives off of a roof,positive
naturally nobody believes his story,positive
nobody that is except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of,positive
edwards then meets agent kay the man who never seems to crack a smile and is introduced to the mib,positive
edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him birth certificate drivers license and even the literal removal of his fingerprints,positive
james edwards no longer exists,positive
meet agent jay,positive
agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about regular duties,positive
eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play,positive
a bug has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two dont or cant stop it,positive
the plot isnt exactly clear but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth and that is crucial that the mib find it before the bug does,positive
barry sonnenfeld who also did the addams family films directs this nicely,positive
its fun its funny its actionpacked,positive
a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be,positive
this is one of those movies that is just fun and cant really be summed up any nicer or clearer,positive
will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch,positive
definitely one of the best films of the the summer of 97 men in black comes highly recommeded from me,positive
capsule the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen,positive
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse,positive
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet,positive
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style,positive
2 4 to 4,positive
perhaps the most disturbing and disturbed,positive
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa,positive
his films all seem to have one style bleak,positive
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold,positive
little known in the us to date his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver,positive
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid,positive
his 1998 film cure with one of his niftiest ideas is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with,positive
cure is probably his classic,positive
last year he released seance a remake of seance on a wet afternoon,positive
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a nonsupernatural story,positive
pulse is kurosawa back on form,positive
taguchi a young computer expert is late with his delivery of some important software,positive
two coworkers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment,positive
taguchi acting very strangely lets his friends look for the missing software,positive
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain,positive
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself,positive
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildewlike spot on the wall,positive
taguchis computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus,positive
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide,positive
but they are not entirely dead,positive
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet,positive
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost,positive
if they say yes they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow,positive
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist,positive
this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing like a computer disk,positive
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses,positive
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers,positive
leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death,positive
this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work,positive
it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death but whatever it does convey is nightmarish,positive
kurosawa who directs his own screenplay ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion,positive
frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact,positive
his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange,positive
junichiro hayashi the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawas films creates a dark cold and gloomy tone,positive
images are obscured by semilighting or are behind plastic curtain,positive
scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might,positive
people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence,positive
seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary,positive
kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock but a deeper metaphysical dread,positive
of any horror filmmaker in the world kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch,positive
i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
its a curious thing ive found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie hes much better and so is the movie,positive
even though in the sixth sense he is the name he doesnt have the pivotal role,positive
that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear cute pun seer a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts,positive
if osment was cute or precious the director going for the maudlin this would be nothing more than a movieoftheweek thankfully osment is not only better than that but in some instances blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance,positive
we get to see his fears vulnerabilities strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies ive seen this year,positive
the whole cast matches him in quality with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter,positive
one thing about this movie its target,positive
this isnt a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest this is more what id call a supernatural drama more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup,positive
one caveat theres a lovely twist in the movie something like the usual suspects where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen,positive
i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto before any hype or critical reviews were out so i went in with no biases,positive
if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it dont let them,positive
let the director explain on his own pace and youll enjoy the movie vastly more,positive
david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head,positive
it is one of many science fiction films released during the last year of this millenium that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future,positive
the story unfolds in a near future where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs,positive
the world of the future is an unfriendly place where the scared inhabitants are hiding in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world,positive
allegra geller jennifer jason leigh the leading game designer in the world is testing her new virtual reality game existenz with a focus group,positive
as they begin she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun,positive
she flees with a young marketing trainee ted pikul jude law who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard,positive
unfortunately her pod an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program is damaged,positive
to inspect it she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her,positive
the events leading up to this and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesnt exist as the players are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot,positive
here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the games perspective,positive
i dont intend to reveal more of the films premise which is structured as a computer game with tasks that the characters must complete to win the game,positive
released after the matrix and dark city existenz has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films,positive
however existenz is moving in a different direction with a premise of its own,positive
a combination of dazzling special effects brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot made the matrix a rare and entertaining science fiction experience with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade,positive
existenz has a completely different atmosphere resembling dark city which is darker more serious and less entertaining,positive
existenz has the opportunities and potential but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored,positive
after the engaging beginning it starts to falter,positive
while i was watching the film many left the theatre during the first hour,positive
and indeed existenz seemed as a complete failure the actors seemed unreal the plot and dialogue silly unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another,positive
but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level explaining all past events the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes,positive
and jet the film fails on several issues,positive
probably the best written character in the story is a game designer who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world than face real life,positive
this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenbergs script to the limits but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown,positive
existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies,positive
it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for,positive
its a cold dark place where the players are forced to interrelate with unreal characters eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will,positive
it doesnt look like a place worth even thinking about,positive
david cronenberg has been the creator of the fly videodrome and the dead zone so its not so hard to guess that existenz is a violent and gory film,positive
besides the regular murders of innocent people the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a twoheaded mutated amfibium,positive
scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he cant make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures,positive
the way i see it this is the films crucial failure,positive
it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time space and problems of our everyday life do not exist a place of blooming blossoms green forests and clear waters a place really worth sacrificing your life for,positive
because of its lack of three dimensionality the film looses most of its possibilities but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes amusing performances especially by willem dafoe and one interesting and important thought depicted in many different ways throughout the movie,positive
during the film the audience is as confused as the characters detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created,positive
the matrix despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts ends with a light at the end of the tunnel,positive
existenz does not,positive
it is a one time experience ending in blood gore and madness a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow,positive
if chris farley had strapped some fake muttonchop sideburns to each side of his head spoken with a thick irish accent and tried his damnedest to play it straight he wouldnt have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in i went down,positive
gleeson whos not dissimilar to the late saturday night live alumnus in terms of physical attributes plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film,positive
bunny is sent to county cork to retrieve one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle,positive
bunny is to accompany git hynes peter mcdonald recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies,positive
that tom french is a mean bollocks,positive
he wants frank back,positive
and a small matter of some 25 000 that toms wife was supposed to have given to frank,positive
for this he wont break anyones thumbs,positive
maybe,positive
inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach i went down follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs dimlylit pubs and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble,positive
mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity the butcher boy,positive
even if you cant comprehend half of what theyre saying gleeson and mcdonald together make i went down a trip worth taking,positive
the film is in many ways reminiscent of another little independent feature 1991s highway 61,positive
that film too was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcphersons tale whimsical observations on life carefullycrafted vignettes deadpan conversational asides and scenes thatll make you laugh out loud,positive
witness the episode in which our goodnatured protagonists bind frank played by peter caffrey to a hotel bed leaving him with only the tv remote for company,positive
that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in highway 61,positive
whats also charming about i went down is how the relationship between buddy and git develops,positive
their trip becomes an education for both of them but the way its handled is neither sappy nor labored,positive
the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation via flashbacks of the relationship between frank and tom,positive
its a little too hollywood and what makes i went down so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies,positive
sure its grittymake that grubbybut its also pretty goofy,positive
although i went down emphasizes the comedic elements of disorganized crime there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter,positive
dont let these deter you though i went down is a little gem,positive
its only playing at one philadelphiaarea theaterand i suspect it wont be there for longso catch it while you can,positive
ingredients pouring rain small flooded town damn about to burst bad guys going after millions of dollars,positive
synopsis at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church,positive
he replies something like the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire,positive
well the fire wasnt that bad since while the church was burning looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows,positive
in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding,positive
everyone has had to evacuate because its raining and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break,positive
enter a working class smartalecky new armored car driver named tom christian slater,positive
suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters,positive
tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money hide it and swim for his life,positive
this makes for an action movie full of jet skis speedboat chases and gun battles as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call,positive
he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen minnie driver,positive
but unknown to tom and karen the national guard never heard toms initial distress call,positive
will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters,positive
opinion dont expect thoughtprovoking issues or dramatics,positive
theres not much more to this movie than hiding running swimming shooting and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning but thats what makes it escapist and fun,positive
relax take your shoes off and break out the popcorn,positive
anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes deep vibrant colors and an epic storyline,positive
its true beauty comes from its subtle ruminations on the politics of power whether its between governments or the interplay between a man and a woman,positive
anna jodie foster is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband,positive
with son in tow she takes the employ of king mongkut chow yunfat to tutor his son in the english language,positive
mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his countrys future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world,positive
anna function is to help provide that link,positive
the core of the film of course deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate,positive
foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wideeyed wonder,positive
she is assertive yet respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him,positive
it is one of fosters strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career,positive
she brings a mature self awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster,positive
its a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkuts monarchy,positive
when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet midfilm she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance,positive
chowyun fats king mongkut is every measure of fosters anna perhaps even more so,positive
this is the chow yunfat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years,positive
he is imposing yet vulnerable playful but stern,positive
it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance,positive
precious time is stolen from the movies 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the kings concubines bai ling and her love of a commoner,positive
it strikes with the subtlety of siams fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story,positive
some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie,positive
although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma a country backed by the british,positive
anna and the king transcends being a predictable traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness,positive
it shows a seduction of intelligence,positive
ever mindful of each others positions anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying if not achingly bittersweet,positive
contrary to the title the boxer is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics,positive
its actually three movies in one a political film a boxing film and a love story,positive
all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal,positive
weve seen it all before and were just not blown away with it like we should be,positive
oh well,positive
its still an excellent irish story,positive
the boxer of the title is danny flynn jim sheridan staple daniel daylewis an exira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years and finds out that his troubles are far from over,positive
first off the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill brian cox and one of its subleaders harry gerard mcsorley both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail,positive
while this is going on danny and his old drunkard buddie ike ken stott who played the chief inspector in danny boyles shallow grave reopen an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects protestant and catholics to work together,positive
danny not only begins teaching kids how to box but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison and is ready to start boxing real people again,positive
and danny runs into his exlove maggie breaking the waves s emily watson who hasnt seen him since he went in,positive
they dont easily start up their romance again because shes the wife of a prisoner whom she married during dannys tenure in prison and also has a son liam ciaran fitzgerald from him whom liam is hoping will get out soon,positive
but the two are slowly redrawn to eachother again and this begins to complicate things,positive
the political story is nothing really special but works in itself,positive
weve seen it many a time before but its at least interesting sometimes emotional and even riveting at times,positive
theres a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty,positive
the boxing story is very minor to the story but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly and even with good sportsmanship,positive
there are only a few boxing scenes but theyre never like raging bull letsstripdownthesporttoitsbones brilliant,positive
theyre more realistic and instead of bone crunching we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother which is slightly unerving at times,positive
and i didnt know daniel daylewis was in such good shape,positive
but the backbone of the story is the love one,positive
because these characters are given such horrible circumstances and since the two leads have such great chemistry together we really feel for their plight,positive
as the film goes on and circumstances get worse and worse the characters have to make real human decisions and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters,positive
this is how you write a love story take note hollywood,positive
these elements are pretty much equally balanced with each of the parts of the stories working handinhand with eachother,positive
i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered and sometimes spilled over into the next,positive
it made sure that we didnt just care for one of them,positive
im not saying theyre all equally great because the love story really carries the film but at least they all work out respectively,positive
the acting is amazing with daylewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry,positive
im not sure if theyre oscarnominee bound but theyre very good,positive
in the supporting roles billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers,positive
but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike who is just a great scene stealer,positive
the direction and cowriting by jim sheridan with the other cowriting credit going to terry george is excellent rounding out the characters well but not pacing everything greatly,positive
i noticed that the first half was very leisurely yet fascinating but the second half whirls by at a quick pace and ends much too quickly,positive
more time could have been spent thinking up the ending since it does seem quite sloppy,positive
though the boxer is a good film it never achieves the greatness that it should,positive
sure its a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get but on its own it just could have been better,positive
but it still works out gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama and features great acting,positive
even if it could have been better thisll do,positive
call me crazy but i dont see saving private ryan as the film of the summer,positive
a good movie yes with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare,positive
an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielbergs best work no,positive
personally if i was spielberg i wouldnt go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindlers list and the indiana jones movies,positive
im guessing steve has a thing for nazis i really wouldnt be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastikawearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie,positive
all lofty pretenses aside saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick,positive
the difference is its easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacons chest while blood spurts like crazy but its damn hard to sit and eat reeses pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield,positive
and believe me theres plenty of it,positive
a 30minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain tom hanks and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire,positive
lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on and all the young men in the audience find themselves never ever wanting to be drafted,positive
cut to some bureaucratic defense office where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties,positive
one woman happens upon an interesting detail three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat and their mother is getting the telegram today,positive
i guess its an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother so the army chief harve presnell sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home,positive
that way the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs ryan,positive
one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know its a mission designed to make the army look good,positive
they question the worth of risking eight soldiers lives to save one and hanks character admits he doesnt give a damn about ryan hes just following orders,positive
if this was a john wayne movie things would be different,positive
thered be a phony lets go get that boy gosh darn it,positive
attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war,positive
by doing things this way spielberg admits the instincts of self preservation and complacency that every normal person has,positive
it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosteronedriven stallone movie mission,positive
the movies pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semiintrospective conversation among the soldiers,positive
hanks is painted first as a nailstough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men,positive
its not that way for long,positive
edward burns the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isnt available is the impulsive one,positive
jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time and so on,positive
none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes but was spielbergs obvious intention,positive
i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long how were they going to fill three hours time searching for one person and still make it interesting,positive
there are a few false starts hanks finds one private ryan in ted dansons company apparently danson joined the army after ink was canceled and breaks the bad news before learning its the wrong ryan,positive
and of course the movies far from over when hanks does locate ryan matt damon the other guy you get when affleck isnt available,positive
thats when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick although body parts and limbs still fly like never before,positive
saving private ryan is worth your time but its definitely no schindlers list,positive
the battle scenes are intense and realistic but some of the attempts at sincere emotion arent,positive
the movies bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out whining tell me ive led a good life,positive
tell me im a good man,positive
spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any threehour movie about the past should be framed by a selfcontained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present,positive
much more effective are subtler scenes like the one where several of hanks men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers and they make light of what theyre doing by pretending theyre playing poker,positive
this while an airborne division marches by their eyes full of that mound of dogtags,positive
by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war the audience gets the message,positive
and even if its not a classic saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there,positive
damn those trailers,positive
had it not been for the advertising of this film which reveals far too much about its contents i would have been glued to under the sand,positive
as it is the film retains some value thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling and a more mature francois ozon in the directors chair,positive
marie charlotte rampling and her husband jean bruno cremer lounge on the beach,positive
she takes a nap while he goes for a swim,positive
when marie wakes up jean is nowhere to be found,positive
she contacts authorities but they cant find him either,positive
did he disappear to start a new life,positive
was he killed by accident,positive
did he commit suicide,positive
marie still asks herself these questions a year later and in order to move on with her life she must find some answers,positive
its a fine premise and this little movie uses it to the limit,positive
the film moves at a leisurely pace a bit slow but relaxing,positive
its a very visual story and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles,positive
this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie who shot the film in a dreamy haze and the lead performance by rampling,positive
rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie you connect with her character instantly despite that shes delusional,positive
the scenes where she interacts with her husband who she still believes is alive are heartbreaking,positive
she cant quite get over him,positive
theyve been married for twentyfive years,positive
the other actors particularly jacques nolot are excellent too,positive
the sex in the film is rather unneeded but compared to ozons criminal lovers its the disney channel,positive
likely to cause some discussion afterwards under the sand is a fine movie going experience,positive
while its hard to recommend as entertainment its a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss,positive
ozon seems to ask what you would do and thats certainly a hard question to answer,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
the teaser trailers for my best friends wedding scarsely gave reason for hope it looked like the sort of goofy lighthearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight but little more id frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often,positive
it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friends wedding was such a success a strong bouyant romanticcomedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects featuring a triumphant performance from ms roberts,positive
the heroine of my best friends wedding is julianne potter julia roberts a successful new york restaurant critic and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes rupert everett that years ago she had made a pact with her dear best friend and exlover michael oneal dermot mulroney a sports writer that if they both hadnt married by the time they reached 28 they had promised to marry each other,positive
both julianne and michael are both single of course and when george inquires about michaels age julianne realizes that hes mere weeks away from his 28th birthday and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day,positive
however she finds herself even more distraught when michaels call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace cameron diaz and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary,positive
the setup for my best friends wedding then is a fairly conventional one and in many ways the films storyline is formulaic but only to a certain extent the film was directed by p j hogan whose first feature muriels wedding had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting uglyduckling story and the same holds true for my best friends wedding which confidently combines traditional romanticcomedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour,positive
the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr hogan,positive
for example theres a heartfelt emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film with a trio of teenagers inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks harmonizing in the background,positive
my best friends wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allens everyone says i love you id even assert its a more successful one,positive
my best friends wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well,positive
in a typical romanticcomedy kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty conniving ice queen and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps this film is smarter than that here kimmy is sweet sincere and innocent julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmys life shed actually like her too,positive
the george character is almost a staple of recent film the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason but in my best friends wedding he gets to have a playful mischievous and charming personality,positive
throughout the film the formulaisms one often sees is romanticcomedy are given little twists and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion,positive
there is a lot of smart writing in the wellpaced screenplay by ronald bass were given four interesting vivid and likeable characters with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments,positive
my best friends wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts who turns in a topnotch confident and reassured performance as julianne,positive
this isnt the sort of role one usually associates with ms roberts the julianne characters neurotic fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role but ms roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience if not entirely sympathetic even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable,positive
even better than ms roberts though is cameron diaz who turns in a shining performance in my best friends weddding,positive
with a smile which lights up the screen she effectively conveys kimmys insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner and never hits a false note in the film,positive
she even sings i wont soon forget her charming serenade of i just dont know what to do with myself,positive
rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film,positive
his george is a bit of a devilish rogue entirely affable and mr everetts performance is a delight to watch hes clearly having fun and his joy is infectuous,positive
dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role unlike the other characters in the film hes not given a lot to do but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms roberts and mr mulroney and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic,positive
when julia roberts lustre began to fade and she was usurped from her title as americas sweetheart by sandra bullock i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile,positive
while that didnt quite work out its nearcertain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 the romanticcomedy will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game,positive
my best friends wedding marks a return to form for ms roberts and cements p j hogans reputation as a skilled director of comedy,positive
there is a scene early in soul food george tillmans comedydrama about a large africanamerican family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis that caught me completely off guard,positive
during a wedding the groom is flirting with some tramp and in an attempt to to prevent a scene his mother in law played by irma p hall comes to the rescue,positive
the way in which she does this makes me think irma p hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now,positive
however this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them,positive
vanessa williams vivica fox and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life,positive
williams is teri a successful lawyer who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career,positive
fox is maxine the strongest of the sisters which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad who narrates the film,positive
long is bird a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married,positive
her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving,positive
at the center of everything is irma p hall as big mama jo,positive
every sunday the family gathers together for dinner at mama jos house,positive
there is lots of conversation lots of laughs and the occasional controversy,positive
mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should,positive
she is stern and disciplined but also caring and forgiving,positive
everything is going fine until a tragedy befalls mama jo,positive
all of a sudden a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family,positive
it gets so bad sunday dinner is even cancelled,positive
without mama jos guidance there is noone to keep the family together which frustrates ahmad,positive
miles and maxines marriage begins to fall apart as he focuses on his music and flirts with the troublesome faith,positive
lems temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him,positive
and teri tries to prevent maxines efforts to sell mama jos house,positive
the third act of the film deals with ahmads attempts to patch things up,positive
he decides to take over where mama jo left off and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner,positive
the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding with special notices to irma p hall and brandon hammond,positive
hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy,positive
her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie,positive
brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future,positive
he is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note,positive
tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up,positive
every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing except maybe an odd flashback sequence,positive
the dialogue is beleiveable and funny,positive
and then theres the food,positive
tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food and it indeed looks very tasty,positive
i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family,positive
soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year,positive
robert altmans cookies fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good,positive
it is a sunny delightful dreamy comedy filled with lovely performances skillful direction and topped off with an understated clever extraordinary script,positive
as this is an ensemble piece it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs,positive
first we meet willie charles s dutton an honest man with a slight drinking habit,positive
we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness despair and want of her dead husband,positive
we cut to camille glenn close who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora julianne moore,positive
then we briefly get acquainted with emma liv tyler an apparent relative of cookie who is a downbutnotout teen outcast still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live,positive
we also fleetingly see emmas lover jason chris odonnell an ambitious but far too excitable young cop,positive
we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion,positive
we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband,positive
she exclaims here i come,positive
and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself,positive
soon after her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl comes upstairs finds cookie dead and flips out,positive
convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow yet sweet sister that it was a murder,positive
she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well scattering jewelry all over the floor breaking a few cabinets windows and doors and then throwing the gun out in the back yard,positive
the only reasonable suspect is willie who immediately gets taken into custody and put in a jail cell they all know he didnt do it so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma,positive
meanwhile the unperturbed camille continues her nonetoosubtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success,positive
so begins cookies fortune a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as a southern spin on fargo except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers darker somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade,positive
robert altmans slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well in that both films focus on and off on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town,positive
indeed most of the characters in cookies fortune are loads of fun to observe and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi dimensional,positive
glenn close turns in an insubstantial in terms of her career but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie and she is perfectly cast as the prolific aunt alexandria character endlessly obsessed with family dignity,positive
the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s dutton mimic a time to kill,positive
there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours even days after the film ends,positive
cookies fortune is such a movie,positive
i loved the light kindhearted approach altman whose last project was the dark intense drama the gingerbread man took towards the tricky subject matter,positive
i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast,positive
i even liked the trite in the south everybody is related to everybody cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close,positive
im not sure why cookies fortune had such an allaround pleasing effect on me,positive
perhaps its that good ol southern charm,positive
one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids,positive
although blackandwhite films are frequently viewed as suspect ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind,positive
and if you can find a colorful action film even if it is from six decades ago then there is a real possibility of a take home hit,positive
so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood a high spirited version of the walter scott story,positive
nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngolds melodramatic music ralph dawsons fast paced editing and carl jules weyls lush sets the film is probably best remembered for errol flynns charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley a k a robin hood,positive
flynn with his handsome figure and toothy smile charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself,positive
let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household,positive
the littlest rhodes jeffrey age 8 liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more,positive
ill let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review,positive
simply stated the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre the swashbuckler,positive
robin with a smile from eartoear fights off a hundred men without a scratch,positive
although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930s james bond the production values and the acting raise it above that level,positive
robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor,positive
robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows,positive
in this movie however he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country,positive
robin with his courage and athletic skills serves as a role model for kids,positive
and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamyeyed lady marian fitzswalter the story has heavy romantic overtones,positive
filmed in the typical richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players,positive
in scene after scene the picture charms the audience,positive
who wouldnt fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest even if the outcome is so clearly preordained,positive
and of course he doesnt just win he does so by splitting the other mans arrow,positive
watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments,positive
sherlock holmes as the villain sir guy of gisbourne for example just doesnt seem right even if basil rathbone did have a reallife identity outside of his most famous role,positive
and then there are those wigs from the makeup department so bad they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy,positive
as was popular in the cinema of that era people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks,positive
bad guys are banished rather than killed and lovers go off handinhand doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing,positive
the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful cartoonish figures,positive
hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore so try to savor the old ones when you can,positive
the adventures of robin hood runs 1 42,positive
it is not rated but containing absolutely nothing offensive it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages,positive
jeffrey thinks the film is great and gives it,positive
he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures he hates the sight of blood in movies,positive
his favorite parts are the battles and the ending and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ian hunter,positive
i know that funnest isnt a word,positive
fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective,positive
but thats the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run,positive
no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ive ever seen,positive
so to hell with websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while,positive
i cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner,positive
the chickens at tweedys farm are up to something,positive
living in a concentration camplike atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box,positive
one night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer,positive
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for a pieselling plan,positive
she orders a huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out,positive
what sort of pies,positive
chicken pies of course,positive
codirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave,positive
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures,positive
part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new,positive
the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories,positive
but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived,positive
now teaming with codirector peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run,positive
the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement,positive
thing is the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done,positive
part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens,positive
park and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is,positive
but theyre chickens so its funny to us,positive
another thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing,positive
there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17,positive
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom,positive
theres even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history,positive
the braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it,positive
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution,positive
consider this since july of last year ive seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online,positive
out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome,positive
why,positive
because once you got past the thought that theyre parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose,positive
they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing,positive
conversely chicken run doesnt lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene,positive
if youve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun,positive
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character,positive
park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either,positive
enjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history but if youve got it chicken run is that much richer,positive
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them,positive
ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it,positive
she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer,positive
the characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived but sweet,positive
poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help,positive
jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence,positive
they even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma,positive
one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise,positive
the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens,positive
the animation is firstrate,positive
remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is,positive
this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail,positive
as in such topnotch family fare as a bugs life or toy story 2 chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame,positive
certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details,positive
anyway the movies just a boatload of fun,positive
funnest damn movie ive seen all year,positive
plot a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum,positive
as each day passes the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion,positive
saying anything else about the plot would be a crime,positive
have fun,positive
critique i feel like shooting myself in the head are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here,positive
this aint your average happy go lucky kind of picture,positive
this is a deliberately slowpaced mysteryhorror film drenched in atmosphere with a very creepy insane asylum in which most of the film takes place very few clues upfront and lots to talk about afterwards,positive
will it bore some people to sleep,positive
you bet it will,positive
is it made for the scream audiences of the day,positive
absolutely not,positive
i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the cerebral crowd,positive
a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame giving away very little with each step and each sound unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later,positive
ive always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group,positive
in fact i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a mindfuck,positive
if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together well then this movie is definitely for you,positive
its the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate damn i missed that whole peanut butter thing and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark,positive
brrrrrrrrr now,positive
what was that sound in the basement,positive
honey can you go check,positive
and one thing this film doesnt have unlike its hollywoodian counterparts like the haunting is special effects,positive
in fact thats one of the greater things about this movie it feels real because it looks like its actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances i did some research and it was in fact shot on digital video ahha,positive
another great thing about it is that its actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen its mostly implied kids,positive
and as clich d as it might be to say its usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such,positive
other films that this one reminded me of include henry portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project with that same real sense of dread brooding and terror,positive
the film does however move awfully slow and if you really dont get into it completely you really need to concentrate here you will lose the motion of the story and the pentup tension might be released,positive
but overall this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight,positive
and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can how can you go wrong,positive
definitely not a film for everyone but a mustsee for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed count me in,positive
stanley kubrick would be proud,positive
oh yeah so,positive
wheres that gun again,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
the blair witch project 410 blair witch 2 710 the haunting 310 the house on haunted hill 710 lost highway 1010 the pledge 610 the shining 910 the sixth sense 810 unbreakable 810,positive
whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films the end result is always a mess of a script acting directing and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40,positive
the latest movie morass from hollywood the crew appeared equally destined to fail a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship,positive
the scary thing is that its actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month,positive
the crew works for several reasons,positive
the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie following four past their prime wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach,positive
the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their golden paradise by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property,positive
the four mobsters bobby bartellemeo richard dreyfuss joey bats pistella burt reynolds mike the brick donatelli dan hedaya and tony mouth donato seymour cassel decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home,positive
this simple plan suddenly goes screwy of course and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris jennifer tilly who wants her stepmother killed a paranoid latin drug lord whos convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him and a rat with its tail on fire,positive
the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men,positive
instead of concentrating on bobbys search for his daughter the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys balancing the production,positive
the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya seymour cassel and the great great burt reynolds are brought out by each characters uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle,positive
a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs,positive
the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner emmy awardwinning director of the wonder years,positive
the quick script written by barry fanaro screenwriter of kingpin is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit,positive
the crew is a prime example of how simple and drywitted a comedy can get these days,positive
the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids phallus symbols in the head or grandmothers giving head in a spa,positive
in the steady flow of extreme comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main its the elder statesmen like dreyfuss reynolds and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice a decent script and good acting,positive
let me open this one with a confession i love cop movies,positive
i adore them with such an unwavering near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers steven,positive
was it any good,positive
well just about as good as baldwins steven seagal impression for those ive confused the answer is a resounding no,positive
now let me clarify i dont love just any cop movie im not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80s and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker,positive
im partial to those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection,positive
problem is these films come along just about as often as george w bush makes a cogent point so whenever a true cop movie does hit multiplexes i come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably i leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail,positive
so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out 7 50 for a movie called one tough cop which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spinoff no,positive
truth is im a sucker for those barren streets that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield us from their iniquitous clutches,positive
yes its all very corny and awfully boys clubish which im guessing is precisely where these feelings come from,positive
as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joes enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos,positive
as an adult my tastes havent changed all that drastically sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film but i still delight at the promise a guy film could potentially bring,positive
now what if its the cops whore the corrupt ones,positive
ooh that one really gets me going these protectors using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain,positive
throw a courtroom drama yech,positive
into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city,positive
how absorbing is prince of the city you ask,positive
so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama a subgenre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar i remained completely and utterly involved,positive
the film stars treat williams who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at,positive
since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city i cannot provide an answer as to why it didnt,positive
though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves,positive
like mickey rourke and eric roberts both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is a talented leading man who didnt make it to where he should have,positive
if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell,positive
here the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacinos in serpico also directed by lumet,positive
williams plays danny ciello a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty prejuliani streets of new york,positive
they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes,positive
and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done,positive
the squad relies entirely on informants low level junkies to gain access to the big wigs and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice,positive
danny has done this and though hes a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way,positive
he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a double agent,positive
he does so with one condition he will not rat on his partners,positive
right away we know that that is exactly what hell have to do,positive
and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be,positive
undercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like in too deep,positive
how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position,positive
prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet as well as a handful of intense performances most notably by treat,positive
lumets greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back and lets the camera soak up the action,positive
his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension and he rarely holds for reaction shots instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking,positive
lumets worst tendency is one that many film makers especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension,positive
this isnt as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan lumets most recent cop lawyer endeavor a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching,positive
though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he was on sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot,positive
some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic,positive
hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable,positive
of course cop movies arent popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines but just look at the average hollywood action movies flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isnt gay the lame comic relief character whos never funny and on and on,positive
for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills,positive
it focuses completely on its story and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies,positive
theres a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if hes about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing,positive
this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human excuse me weak,positive
in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness straining to get the words out,positive
hes lost his voice,positive
does that little itty bitty detail matter,positive
maybe not to most but it sure made my night,positive
and in a sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence its nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things,positive
carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town she goes to college in california,positive
there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore who is a city boy,positive
when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving she brings shore with her and her parents lane smith and cindy pickett are less than thrilled,positive
dan gauthier guginos boyfriend from high school proposes to gugino,positive
gugino isnt ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore,positive
she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end,positive
forget jurassic park cliffhanger the firm and last action hero soninlaw is the film to see this summer,positive
soninlaw is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers especially fans of the wiez,positive
when soninlaw is long gone and forgotten the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then,positive
this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it,positive
nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen,positive
although the basic story line has been done many many times before the film is still fun to watch,positive
the laughs are plentiful especially when the wiez is around,positive
the way some of the jokes are done are new even though some of the jokes are old,positive
there are also several new jokes that at least i havent seen before,positive
still when presented right even old material can be funny still,positive
this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesnt contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price,positive
the cast for this film does an excellent job,positive
pauly shore encino man is the star attraction of this film,positive
he is great and knows how to entertain the audience,positive
pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious,positive
this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role,positive
carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl,positive
she makes her character believable on some levels yet interesting at the same time,positive
the person who played the grandfather mason adams i believe also does a great job,positive
the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen,positive
patrick renna who played guginos little brother was a little annoying but no where as near as macaulay culkin and for only part of the time so i can forgive him,positive
tiffaniamber thiessen a killer among friends saved by the bell does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen,positive
she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television,positive
she wasnt given overly much to do in the film but what she had she does a good job with,positive
hollywood is a pimp,positive
a fat cigarsmoking chump wearing a fur hat and 12 gold chains around its fat hairy chest,positive
all of its stars and starlets are an evil brood of scumsucking vampires looking for the next percentage take the next summer blockbuster the next casting couch to audition on,positive
pumping out comicbook adaptations terrible sequels to mediocre films and remakes of foreign films to the nearest american movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls and bad sound systems,positive
how much longer can the works of peckinpah fassbinder fuller castle preminger and lee be placed and forgotten in the wrong sections of the local blockbuster stores,positive
how many more silver and weinstein films can we enduring in this stinky decaying state of american cinema,positive
but now from john i dont give a shit what you think about my movies waters comes the siren call to all frustrated filmmakers and aficionados cecil b demented a warped and twisted tale of how far a filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal and social revolution,positive
stephen dorff in a careerdefining role is cecil b demented a crazed director devoted to making the most radical underground film,positive
together with his film production cult the sprocket holes who wear tattoos of peckinpah lee fuller castle anger fassbinder preminger on various parts of their bodies as badges of honor they kidnap a hollywood movie starlet played with perfect ridiculousness by melaine griffith and force her to take the starring role in dementeds film,positive
with no budget and no contracts for extras demented and his crew take to the streets for production of raving beauty a crass terrorist film about an angry owner of an independent theater and her brood out to destroy the mainstream film business,positive
using ultimate reality with real bullets real people and real terror demented and his crew of misfits attack a mall theater terrorize the maryland film commission and crash a movie studio shooting a certain sequel to a really annoying tom hanks film,positive
dementeds crewmembers are maimed and killed popcorn machines are used for target practice and no one can have sex until the film is complete,positive
its like bowfinger only you know good,positive
the film moves with zigs and zags like the magic bullet of kennedys assassination,positive
the zeal of dementeds cause catches quickly and conveys the urgent message of doing something anything for the accomplishment of artistic motivations,positive
the crewmembers all hold the quirkiness common in waters previous films pink flamingos hairspray polyester pecker and speak in the choppy jaded dialogue used frequently by waters,positive
it is as if waters script strips away the unnecessary dialogue common to most pretentious indie films and just delivers the goods,positive
cecil takes such warped avenues of expression that it seems like it might actually outdo itself,positive
you can see how a major studio might take this film reedit it cut a deal with the remaining crew members who are still alive and make a few sequels a la the blair witch project,positive
but thats for the future,positive
overall the ride is fantastic its one of waters best films to date and this years fight club for filmmakers,positive
john waters starring stephen dorff melaine griffith alicia witt adrian grenier larry gilliard jr mink stole ricki lake kevin nealon producers john fielder mark tarlov anthony delorenzo joe caraccio jr,positive
once again the battle is dreamworks versus disney earlier this year the mammoth companies fought to the death with their endoftheworld asteroid flicks deep impact and armageddon,positive
here we are now just a few months later and theyre at it again with dueling bug movies antz and a bugs life,positive
what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution,positive
i mean come on what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computeranimated films about bugs,positive
as was the case with the meteor movies disney has come out on top though antz is a likable movie a bugs life is far superior,positive
in fact this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz i became immersed in the world of a bugs life while antz just made me scrutinize everything,positive
but its not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison,positive
a bugs life is a remarkable film in its own right and deserves to be seen apart from any other computeranimated film about bugs,positive
in fact its one of the best films this year its smart subtle and funny but its also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining,positive
i havent had such a good time at the movies in months,positive
it tells the story of an ant named flick voice by dave foley hes a nice guy but hes also a troublemaker,positive
the ants spend all season putting together the offering a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers,positive
just before the grasshoppers come flick accidentally knocks over the offering and ruins everything for the entire colony the grasshoppers leader hopper kevin spacey is enraged and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer or theyre all dead,positive
flick feeling responsible for this sets off to look for help he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them,positive
he heads to the city the city being a house a few miles away where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs a ladybug denis leary who is spectacular a black widow bonnie hunt a caterpillar joe ranft a butterfly madeline kahn a rhinoceros beetle michael mcshane and a stick david hydepierce also giving a hilarious performance,positive
flick doesnt know theyre actors and they dont know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position,positive
the most obvious element of a bugs life is the quality of animation,positive
created by pixar the same people who brought us toy story a bugs life has some of the most amazing visuals ive ever seen,positive
the bugs seem to inhabit a threedimensional space and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action,positive
this is a lush colorful world full of life and imagination the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives matches bottlecaps tin cans etc and make them active objects in the bugs world is innovative,positive
the film is also mercilessly exciting particularly in a superblystaged scene involving our heroes escape from a bird a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening,positive
but the makers of a bugs life know where the importance lies story and characters,positive
flick with solid voice work from foley is a great guy to lead the story,positive
but the real treat comes with the circus bugs theyre such a likable group of characters the standouts are the stick hydepierce is so good francis the ladybug and the big fat caterpillar,positive
all of these bugs have more than a token personality which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs and it also keeps the tearjerking scenes from seeming obligatory,positive
in my review of antz i said that the film is a clever copout because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an antlike existence,positive
in concept a bugs life is basically the same movie except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didnt like about it,positive
with such strong work in both animation and script a bugs life is nothing but a joy to sit through,positive
it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie but a bugs life is so good that im sure it will find its audience,positive
after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies its downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty,positive
one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsys wedding,positive
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it,positive
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald who hasnt made a worthwhile film since 1986,positive
but the fact is betsys wedding is also an alan alda film,positive
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life,positive
written and directed by alda betsys wedding is a vibrant sliceoflife mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor,positive
aldas comic elixir is smooth and refreshingand a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare,positive
as bride and groom molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film but they are by far the least interesting,positive
walsh is a nonentity with all the screen presence of a door knob,positive
ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain,positive
she looks hideous with her shortcropped orange hair red lipstick and grotesque outfits,positive
shes supposed to be a dress designer but she looks more like a clown,positive
and to make matters worse ringwalds performance matches her appearance,positive
thankfully alda keeps ringwalds screen time to a minimum he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters,positive
the wedding is just a device to bring together the brides workingclass italian family and the grooms rich gentile family,positive
ringwalds folks are homey and downtoearth with alda as her freespirited father madeline kahn as her practical mother and ally sheedy as her lonely sister,positive
walshs clan on the other hand is prim proper and ostentatious,positive
when the two families meet and mingle the movie becomes a story of culture clash or as one character puts it money versus values,positive
ally sheedy in a wonderfully understated performance is one of the films most pleasant surprises,positive
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body,positive
its anthony lapaglia however who seizes the spotlight,positive
lapaglia plays stevie dee a suave overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with oldfashioned chivalry,positive
lapaglias sincere but dimwitted character is a riot,positive
and whats uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure,positive
lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his rolemodel and partly a ripoff,positive
i dont know whether to say a star is born or a star is reborn but i do know that lapaglias overthetop performance should not be missed,positive
the scrumptious comic acting however extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia,positive
joe pesci in particular sinks his teeth into his role as aldas unscrupulous brotherinlaw a slum lord with mob ties who is cheating on his wife catherine ohara,positive
alda faced with challenge of both directing and acting somehow finds just the right comic touch as the brides financiallystrapped father a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet,positive
the film adopts aldas psychological point of view as he tries to one plan the wedding and two pay for it,positive
as a filmmaker aldas style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful,positive
and while he doesnt have the comic genius of a woody allen alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy,positive
just in time for halloween and christmas the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldnt be more appropriate,positive
with all of the attention thrown to family films in recent years namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters its high time we raised the intellectual level of childrens fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios,positive
with that in mind it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago,positive
nightmare is the story of one mans quest to discover his true purpose in life to look beyond the accolades of his peers the achievements of his years and the praise of his ego,positive
jack skellington the pumpkin king of halloweentown is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere,positive
but during his reign as pumpkin king jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday,positive
after the completion of one particular halloween season jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world,positive
imagine his surprise to discover christmastown a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween surrounded by happy elves making toys and with good cheer all around,positive
upon his return to halloweentown jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping sandy claws employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children,positive
he then aims to take over the role as primary joyprovider and giftbearer to the children of the world in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had,positive
alas the comingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads psychotic wooden ducks a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose and a large sinister singing bag named oogie boogie,positive
tim burton the man behind such great films as ed wood beetlejuice peewees big adventure and edward scissorhands is the creative force behind nightmare,positive
originally burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture,positive
the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film with bold colors imaginative character design and its simple yet compelling story,positive
the direction of harry selick who also directed james and the giant peach is strong offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters,positive
also memorable are the songs in the film written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman the next john williams of film composing,positive
the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone,positive
its not just childs play for the holidays its a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are without compromise,positive
what better message is there for christmas,positive
while screen adaptations of john irvings novels have been disappointingly uneven the films have all shared one particular strength key casting,positive
who can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon the transsexual quarterback of the world according to garp or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in the hotel new hampshire,positive
a lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of the cider house rules an adaptation of irvings poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man called homer wells,positive
among those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid tobey maguire assume the pivotal role the decision to cast michael caine as his mentor and father figure dr wilbur larch the etheraddicted head obstetrician of the st clouds orphanage maine and the decision to offer jane alexander and kathy baker supporting roles as his head nurses,positive
then there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where homer wells finds himself shortly after leaving st clouds including delroy lindo oscar worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them,positive
theres kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house and charlize theron as candy the lovely lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot paul rudd sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells a man whos never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster,positive
am i forgetting anyone,positive
yes,positive
kieran culkin and paz de la huerta as dissolute orphanage residents who make you sit up and take notice every time theyre on the screen,positive
but with the cider house rules the good people decisions dont end with the cast,positive
irving has written his own screenplay in order to get it right this time last years simon birch loosely based on his a prayer for owen meaney was a bigscreen example of irving handled substandardly the author appears fleetingly as a stationmaster here,positive
rachel portman a composer of such sweet and lyrical tenderness provides a score thats absolutely right for the projectsweet lyrical and tender,positive
theres impressive new england photography by oliver stapleton too,positive
last but by no means least is my life as a dog director lasse hallstr m who shows enormous skill in pulling this collective together and helping bring irvings marvelously touching story to life,positive
for the many beloved who pass away in the cider house rules its an extraordinarily lifeaffirming story,positive
and now thanks to these talented individuals its an extraordinarily lifeaffirming film,positive
this is a good year if you want plenty of scifi on your multiplex,positive
from the comedies mars attacks and men in black to luc bessons powerful the fifth element and to this sci that is event horizon,positive
more is on the way with contact and alien ressurection being released later this year,positive
the story is thus in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive,positive
a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe instantaneously,positive
this is achieved by creating a gateway infact a black hole between the craft and its required destination,positive
in this case from near neptune to proxima prime,positive
however when the event horizon attempts this it dissappears without trace leaving two searches for it fruitless,positive
seven years later it reappears transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts,positive
a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate,positive
the team is led by laurence fishburne and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive,positive
as the team search the event horizon they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around,positive
not a good sign,positive
to make matters worse as they search the ship they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago,positive
it soon becomes apparent that wherever the ship went it bought something back with it,positive
something very very evil,positive
the first thing youll notice in this film is its incredible visual effects,positive
they really are eye popping with some great models to boot,positive
the acting is quite good with some occasional witty moments,positive
sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team in a cool calm take no nonense manner,positive
it is his acting skills that help hold this film together,positive
the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one,positive
it starts off incredibly well but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur,positive
however the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this producing one the most nail biting or in my case straw of my drink biting,positive
climaxes ive recently witnessed,positive
overall event horizon is a smart film indeed,positive
its very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals,positive
but be warned the horror scenes despite being very brief are very very gory,positive
not for the squemish,positive
this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday,positive
jon bennet played by andrew howard is an extremely good assassin,positive
as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him,positive
he has become an unquestioning weapon,positive
he is in the employ of a kingpin david calder far more evil than he is,positive
but even assassins have innocent pasts,positive
he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school,positive
complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime,positive
a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin,positive
calder is a familiar actor in britain though not frequently seen in the us,positive
he was seen in the world is not enough,positive
here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years,positive
he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake,positive
his lair is underground apparently in a sewer where he lives like the king of sewer rats,positive
it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennets life,positive
paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpins lair he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness,positive
by using semidarkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world,positive
this is a world that is cold and unfriendly,positive
sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see,positive
this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach,positive
we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that,positive
the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross but it is sarossys film all the way,positive
it creates indelible images of evil,positive
i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 3 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
i do hope they do not use the tagline dont mess with mr inbetween,positive
a thriller set in modern day seattle that marked marky marks migration from the good vibrations and calvin klein undie ad guy to mark wahlberg thespianatlarge and a mighty good one at that,positive
plot boy wahlberg meets girl witherspoon,positive
boy likes girl,positive
girl likes boy,positive
boy and girl begin dating,positive
parents of girl arent crazy about the boy,positive
girl steps to boys defense,positive
family problems occur,positive
girl learns more about the boy,positive
boy goes nuts,positive
fun ensues,positive
critique ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love,positive
well if you ever have then this film is definitely for you,positive
it isnt the most original premise in the world but it is handled pretty well here and pretty quickly for that matter a speedy 90 minutes,positive
i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg of boogie nights infamy 7 510,positive
he completely captured all the goodness and badness of the main character of this film and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience as best villain at the 1997 mtv movie awards,positive
the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting and of course the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in look for the nice bikini and butt shots if,positive
youre into that kind of thing that is,positive
i didnt much care for the relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived but for the most part i was really into this movie,positive
then again daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the big deal was about his daughter dating david,positive
his reply the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps and the girl is my daughter,positive
good point,positive
all in all the movie kicked some fun ass mindless as it was and effectively demonstrated every parents worst nightmare,positive
mind you i still cant tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag but hey life goes on,positive
and on a personal note we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual and let me tell you all it was a flaming success,positive
another firm recommendation by joe schmoe,positive
little known facts director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross 810 back in 1992 at close range 7 510 in 1986 and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990,positive
mark wahlberg stands 5 9 is born in massachusetts dropped out of highschool later got his ged and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch,positive
his brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame,positive
he is also testing the waters on the acting front,positive
this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven,positive
he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers,positive
all of his movies have one main thing in common they dont skimp on the violence,positive
in a verhoeven movie a guy doesnt get shot once in the chest he gets shot many times all over the body,positive
robocop takes place in detroit in the future,positive
things are pretty bleak,positive
the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force,positive
peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner nancy allen,positive
peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed,positive
meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed209 model robot crime fighter,positive
someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after,positive
the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace,positive
it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off but plot twists keep it exciting,positive
the acting is bad from weller when he is human but very good when he is robocop,positive
nancy allen does a decent job,positive
this movie doesnt leave itself open for a sequel exactly,positive
but they made one anyway,positive
enter,positive
robocop 2 starring peter weller and nancy allen directed by irvin kershner,positive
detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film,positive
ocp is trying to develop an improved robocop 2 that will be more than a match for criminals,positive
most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over leaving robocop to be the police force in the city,positive
this film is pretty bizaare,positive
it has a 13 yearold druglord who curses as much as eddie murphy even more violence than the original and some more humor,positive
the plot of this movie is pretty large almost too much so,positive
there are three or four plot lines weaving around that dont really match up,positive
the effects are still decent though,positive
this sequel isnt more of the same really just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals,positive
if you liked the first one watch this,positive
but be dissapointed,positive
so later comes,positive
robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke,positive
ocp is now owned by a large japanese company,positive
robocop joins a band of rebels to counterattack the evil empire i mean ocp,positive
the japanese send a cyborgninja to deal with robocop,positive
among other things,positive
this movie is easier to follow than the last one,positive
which means the plot isnt quite as crowded,positive
this movie isnt anything special though,positive
just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kidfriendly way,positive
really not reccomended,positive
i hate to burst your bubble but after all the star power mega bucks screenwriters directors and cool trailers men in black is not the best movie of the summer,positive
its pretty good in its own right yes but i would probably split the best movie honors among spawn con air and maybe event horizon,positive
its main problem is that its quickly forgettable and i cant remember one truly good scene from it,positive
from con air it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt,positive
in spawn it was the living room hell conclusion at the end,positive
in event horizon it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hells forces,positive
and all of was pretty dang good,positive
but as for men in black the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches,positive
i remember it not for its humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted,positive
and yes i did see mimic which is something ill touch on in a later review,positive
back to men in black is it just me or does that sound funny,positive
i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard etc for those of you who arent comicgeeks wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars what the new yorker is to high society what boys life is to boy scots,positive
okay that one was pretty pathetic,positive
few people know this but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was while not honestpoliticianrare very hard to find,positive
this was after the release of the highgrossing batman forever and it said that tommy lee jones and chris odonnell were being considered for the roles in the comic book there were no black men in black,positive
kind of weird huh,positive
all i can say is thank god they didnt cast chris odonnell,positive
i know i cant be the only person on the planet who thinks hes an annoying preppie little snot,positive
sorry,positive
my apologies to odonnell fans,positive
i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him anticipating rather craftily that if the movie was a big hit it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely,positive
he decided not to sell them to me because they were innappropriate,positive
hmm,positive
so now youre probably wondering why ive wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years,positive
good question,positive
ill move on to the movie now,positive
as you probably already know will smith and tommy lee jones agents k and j respectively belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 or its nickname mib men in black,positive
men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear and theyre mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while theyre here on earth,positive
not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who havent seen this movie but a basicallybigroachtypebug lands in a redneck farmers yard inhabits his body and attempts to destroy the entire universe,positive
not bad eh i have no idea why i just typed that,positive
im not even really paying attention anymore,positive
the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black,positive
i found their main headquarters to be boring as were the cool weapons they had,positive
the noisy cricket just plain sucked no matter what anyone said,positive
and the movie definitely surprised me in tone although it probably shoudlnt have,positive
its director barry sonnenfield is known for black humor directing both addams family movies,positive
this movie was basically a black comedy not an fi like i expected from the trailers,positive
dont get me wrong on what i think of this movie,positive
its not bad i gave it,positive
it was mostly entertaining throughout its run and had a very good ending although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it,positive
my diagnosis for this picture a good weekend rental but not worth a movie ticket,positive
of course the movie is now long gone from theaters but thats beside the point,positive
i think,positive
capsule a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg,positive
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs,positive
it lets us see some new dinosaurs is that an oxymoron and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure,positive
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious,positive
i had a good time,positive
low 2 4 to 4,positive
here goes my credibility,positive
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority,positive
i liked the third jurassic park film,positive
i even liked the second jurassic park film,positive
in a lot of ways jurassic park the lost world was a creative threeway braiding together of michael crichtons novel the lost world arthur conan doyles novel the lost world and the classic silent film version of the doyle,positive
jp2 was an adventure as doyle said for the boy whos half man or the man whos half boy,positive
that is what all the jurassic park films are,positive
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house,positive
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomons mines had underwritten characters also,positive
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs,positive
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting,positive
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds,positive
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require,positive
i feel i got my moneys worth,positive
the story opens with eric played by trevor morgan and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica,positive
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park,positive
they hope no doubt to get a look at the islands dinosaurs from a safe height,positive
the height is safe but driving the boat in the water is not,positive
the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended,positive
flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant sam neill in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide,positive
he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs,positive
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go,positive
doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple william h macy and tea leoni who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs,positive
they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn,positive
he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once,positive
right,positive
guess what happens next,positive
jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2,positive
first it has alan grant and ellie sattler laura dern back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm,positive
sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 but is still present to tie this story to the first,positive
curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance,positive
one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time,positive
they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films,positive
of course these raptors look a little different also so perhaps they are a different related species,positive
not only are they more intelligent than in the past films they are also more sympathetic,positive
in this story they are not just killing machines they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition,positive
this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized,positive
each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs of course,positive
in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus but larger and presumably more nasty,positive
it has a crocodiles head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright,positive
perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs,positive
sometimes they just move too fast to see,positive
occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision,positive
a few times we get unconvincing matte shot particularly of the laboratory,positive
but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films,positive
the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williamss score for the first film,positive
joe johnston who directs already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky,positive
a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay,positive
the film they have made is a long way from great cinema but it still is fun,positive
if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today the film is for you,positive
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugos novel les miserables,positive
i dont know if a lot of people have though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel,positive
i havent even seen that,positive
going into this film i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters i even expected the film to be a musical,positive
walking away from it im kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material,positive
bille augusts film version is a straightforward beautifully told film,positive
liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean in the beginning he has just been released from a 19year prison sentence,positive
he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior,positive
the priests words of wisdom influence him and he makes a vow to change himself,positive
nine years later we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo nobody knows his real name and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago,positive
conflicts arise when inspector javert geoffrey rush is assigned to vigo,positive
valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him and javert remembers jean to be a convict,positive
javert is hellbent on upholding the law and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice,positive
along the way valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman fantine uma thurman and vows to take care of her daughter cosette played later by claire danes,positive
les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture,positive
the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast and the sets dont look like sets they look like real towns and villages gabriella pescuccis costumes are noticeably spectacular,positive
basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually wellplaced though it does get a bit heavy at times,positive
many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality such as the climax which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening,positive
augusts keeps the story simple which i hear is a good thing since the novel is so complex and easy to follow,positive
he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately,positive
i was also impressed that he didnt go overboard with flash and style which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days such as baz luhrmanns vicious tragedy william shakespeares romeo juliet,positive
this film feels solid and whole and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested,positive
liam neeson is terrific in the main role neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective,positive
thurman in her small role is very good and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very nonglamorous role such as this one,positive
rush is absolutely incredible as javert i dont remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense,positive
i cant be as charitable for danes however though i know she is a talented actress here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit,positive
les miserables is as ive said a solid intelligent motion picture,positive
my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy and perhaps too staged,positive
each scene is grand and huge and exploding with poledouris score but i didnt always want them to be,positive
for the most part les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture,positive
its a good movie and tells its story well but august tends to handfeed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle,positive
however in a film this exciting and wellproduced a few minor flaws are easily overlooked,positive
bruce barths mellow piano plays in the background as conflict erupts in a little country town of florida,positive
ulees gold feels like another fonda creation on golden pond it has a soft calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath the cinematography creates a place of gold yellow and olive colors the music is stirring and tranquil,positive
both deal with the hardships of family life,positive
peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu ezs new film and patricia richardson home improvement star shows she is worthy of big screen attention,positive
nu ez is probably independent films greatest asset along with john sayles and he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating heavy tension,positive
peter fondas performance borrows from his father henry fondas in on golden pond there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father peter fonda is quiet emotional and weary in this exceptional role,positive
ulee jackson the films protagonist is struggling,positive
pressure is mounting at the wrong time,positive
he is a beekeeper and this is his busy season,positive
he has to deal with his two granddaughters needs and erupting hormones he is forced to pick up his daughterinlaw in orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care of her and he is faced with a challenging task unsettled business his son who is now in prison has left behind,positive
he finds his daughterinlaw helen with the two men his son robbed a bank with,positive
she has apparently told these two men that the money that resulted from the robbery is with her husband,positive
that is why he got caught the police found him with the money,positive
now the two men are demanding they get the cash or they will come after ulees two granddaughters,positive
ulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a deranged helen back to his serene little home where her two children that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt,positive
ulee is a man who lost his pals in war he was the only man in his platoon to survive,positive
he refuses help from anybody and does not respond to affectionate gestures,positive
he is a bitter closedoff man whose only passion is his beekeeping his granddaughters and his dead wife,positive
connie his next door neighbor finally gets through to him with friendly favors,positive
she is a nurse and helps helen get through her turmoil with drugs,positive
ulees gold is the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is until the truth is revealed painfully to him he is cold and unfeeling,positive
of course in the end ulee softens up but his journey is absorbing and we have fallen in love with his tiredness and weariness,positive
what is admirable about the movie is peter fondas winning turn as ulee and the story that feels like nobodys fool but in the end ends up in a class of its own,positive
im not really sure what to think about crash,positive
on the surface its a cold boring unerotic porn with name starts a name director and some cool camerawork,positive
i mean it left me completely bored unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out,positive
but then again not every films supposed to leave you entertained,positive
crash is structured to play like a porn flick but with significantly more plot and dialogue,positive
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex we also have a skimpy little plot going on mostly towards the beginning and maybe just a hair of characterization,positive
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good and we dont really see a lot of the actors completely exposed,positive
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience,positive
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of henry and june or the just plain horniness of say deep throat not that ive seen it,positive
if one was to be made completely hot by this film it would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing,positive
the film leaves you cold erotically and maybe in many other ways but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge,positive
the film opens up on a woman catherine deborah kara ungar of the game pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar,positive
suddenly a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind the film doesnt show all this though even if it is nc17,positive
the next scene has a film director james james spader having sex with a camera woman alice poon in an office on the highlypopulated set of his movie,positive
the next scene has the two coming together revealing to us that theyre husband and wife and them sharing in one anothers escapades,positive
while the two are arguably freaky people we at least know they love to live on the edge,positive
soon afterwards james is driving down the road at night reclessly of course hes reading something when he drifts into the other lane and then hits another car face on,positive
james is not killed but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter in a porn also alive,positive
the two go through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again,positive
when james gives her a ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they go to an unbusy parking lot and have a little quickie as they were aroused by the accident,positive
you wouldnt think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan elias kosteas and his crutchcarrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into it,positive
vaughan is into living on the edge as they are but he takes it to another level he loves to recreate famous car crashes,positive
in one scene he and a friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james deans car crash without any padding or safety belts and suffer some concussions but nevertheless get a rush and the attention of the police,positive
soon these five are all having sex with one another be it straight gay or lesbian sex,positive
while this is admittingly all a bit comical the film is almost like a black comedy the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people whos main fetish is living on the edge,positive
im sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents but i personally dont see a connection between car crashes and sex,positive
the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush,positive
his car crash scenes are quick and exciting minimasterpieces were at first not sure if theyll take place but everytime it looks like it may occur we gasp,positive
then when it happens we hold our breath,positive
the same thing happens with sex although not in the same fashion,positive
these people are merely taking it to another level,positive
the only problem with the film is that its a tad redundant,positive
a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half,positive
this goes on for about 100 minutes and it just seems a little too long,positive
the sex and car crashes are far between one another and the time between them are a tad on the boring side,positive
theres no characterization although it could definitely be argued that hey its a porn and were not here to sympathize,positive
but still they coulda cut it down a bit,positive
but the film is saved with its presentation as well as some other elements,positive
the atmosphere is very dark and forboding creating a kind of cool weird feeling,positive
and there are several scenes are just amazing,positive
one scene has catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him questions about being with a man which sounds almost erotic the way she says it,positive
a sequence involving one characters death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs,positive
and the final shot is shot perfectly creating an image of a car crash and a couple having sex in front of it despite the fact that shes wounded,positive
the acting is also pretty good especially for what is almost a porn ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn,positive
while james spader is pretty boring hes usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar is amazing,positive
she speaks all her words in almost zombielike hushes and when shes having sex she has a blank look on her face not showing the viewer whether shes enjoying it or not,positive
in one scene she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her,positive
holly hunter who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this is pretty good and so is rosanna arquette who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role,positive
but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone,positive
he often speaks as he is out of breath showing a definite affinity for his way of life,positive
he has a great deal of energy in several scenes especially one scene where hes taking photographs of a picture and a later scene where hes getting a freaky tatoo,positive
he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes foreshadowing a later scene,positive
kosteas is a little known actor his biggest role was casey jones in teenage mutant ninja turtles but here he shows a denirolike presence hinting that hes capable of bigger roles,positive
while i hardly enjoyed crash its still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who if the exist are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world,positive
these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities and the film which doesnt exactly pain them in a negative light is sucessful in bringing them to light even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out,positive
despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc17 rating theres also an rrated version but i wouldnt even go near that thing anyone looking for a quick turnon should just rent a regular porno,positive
until i saw the night of the hunter it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie,positive
forget the others and the deep end which veered toward strained dramatics the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie ive seen so far this year,positive
even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and theres a not drop of blood to be seen,positive
luckily the night of the hunter charles laughtons first and final directing gig has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being rereleased in october 2001,positive
so theres still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place,positive
robert mitchum stars as harry powell a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash,positive
his newest target is young mother willa harper shelley winters whose murderer husband ben peter graves has hidden 10 000 somewhere,positive
powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs harper after hes released and ben is hanged,positive
but finding the money isnt easy for powell who must contend with his stepchildren billy chapin and sally jane bruce who know where the money is but arent telling,positive
the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time,positive
how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies,positive
what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin,positive
no im not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem,positive
yes there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter,positive
powells love and hate knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing remember radio raheem,positive
and powells black suit with black tie and white shirt could have shaped quentin tarantinos early visual style,positive
seeing the night of the hunter for the first time i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact,positive
you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club,positive
he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears,positive
hes like the senior class president with an evil streak,positive
if i ever need to stay awake ill just picture him crooning leaning,positive
leaning,positive
any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah,positive
and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez who create a series of haunting surreal shadowy images over the rural depressionera backdrop,positive
its a testament to both men that theyre able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline kids harassed by evil guardians by sticking to the old maxim that were more scared by what we dont see,positive
screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters the drunk birdie james gleason whos haunted by his wife and the spoons evelyn varden and walt spoon whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act,positive
the only lapse is the movies third act when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly biblereading mrs cooper lillian gish,positive
her showdown with powell is memorable a battle done with dueling hymns,positive
however the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone but its still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun,positive
do yourself favor and dont miss this if it comes to a nearby theater,positive
note a series of revealing but overlong outtakes preceded the movie,positive
the highlights included the legendary laughton who sounds eerily like mr pitt from seinfeld running winters lines with mitchum and the adorable tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile,positive
hours more of such footage exists as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling,positive
screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives feature story coming soon,positive
taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers,positive
the story centres around a group of people who include brit simon askew and checkout girls claire holmes and ronna polley and the misadventures that they get into split into three chapters,positive
everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers,positive
although qts touch is evident in nearly every frame go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride,positive
liman who also photographed the film has a deft touch with the camera and the film looks good,positive
the film also seems to have benefited from a budget with the nightclub scenes in particular looking pretty good,positive
theres a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk,positive
the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life,positive
holmes one of the dawsons creek cast a show im not particularly fond of displays much talent here and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature,positive
askew is slightly successful being rather obnoxious,positive
no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him but instead of funny annoying hes just annoying,positive
he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it,positive
the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining,positive
also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer who gives an nice evil performance,positive
the script written john august is sharp and witty with good dialogue and some funny jokes,positive
it starts off rather slow however but in about twenty minutes the script has found its footing and just keeps getting better,positive
the stories are largely satisfying although occasionally theres too much attention on one detail but not on another,positive
also some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky,positive
still the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it,positive
it could of tried a little harder in some parts however and these parts lag,positive
because this is a genxer movie the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany and gos one is pretty decent,positive
unlike other genxers movies go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue which is a plus,positive
go is a very easy movie to absorb into and the audience really starts feeling for these characters,positive
thankfully they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you,positive
they are who they are and they stay that way,positive
go is great fun and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers,positive
ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride,positive
erm go to go i guess,positive
i remember making a pact right after patch adams to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality,positive
but darn it music of the heart is just layered with feelgood material and bright characterizations,positive
its hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with its manipulation,positive
in addition its also a terrific family film,positive
this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools,positive
it could also be described as mrs,positive
streeps opus,positive
yes meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari and that brings both good news and bad,positive
out of the gate possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing it is relatively difficult to identify with robertas character and grasp her academic pointofview,positive
she is very strict with her students but what insight does that create into the story,positive
slowly but surely we begin to recognize the intentions of the character and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied,positive
one thoroughly interesting fact about music of the heart lies with the unlikely presence in the directors chair horror veteran wes craven,positive
after leaving an impression with the scream films and the original nightmare on elm street craven has attempted a precarious crossover to drama,positive
at first his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material,positive
it doesnt carry the heartwarming courage of mr,positive
hollands opus but music of the heart is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth,positive
the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate,positive
yes oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep but its the solid ensemble cast that makes music of the heart work,positive
angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams the principal at an inner city school who initially doesnt hire roberta because of her lack of experience,positive
blueeyed adian quinn is endearing as always playing a new love interest,positive
gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive secondgrade teacher and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force,positive
its like a schoolteachers version of thelma and louise in a restrained but effective manner,positive
the movie tackles more issues than just guasparis teaching of violin,positive
theres some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman,positive
in its dramatic buildup the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth,positive
its a good movie for anyone to see although missing out on the experience would not be a lifealtering decision,positive
its commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult crossover and also for achieving his intricate goal,positive
watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments who may ask yourself this is the guy who directed scream,positive
of course when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 with craven directing you may find yourself wondering this is the guy who directed music of the heart,positive
mission accomplished wes,positive
thankfully there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film,positive
in its entirety its a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile,positive
the child actors are cute and perform up to par even if some of their problems are clich d and predictable in the extreme,positive
the mother who doesnt want her son to be learning white mans music the unexpected casuality,positive
basically everything is there,positive
it doesnt strike the perfect chord but music of the heart is highly convincing,positive
the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better but music of the heart is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals,positive
i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of good will hunting based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film in which the main character will hunting matt damon an mit janitor in his early twenties is discovered to be an einsteinlevel closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight,positive
the only problem is that will is a tough street kid whos had his share of runins with the law and before long hes being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight,positive
professor lambeau stellan skarsgard who had brought up the math problems in his lectures tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police will is to be released provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions,positive
this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff but good will hunting rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama,positive
a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and wills therapist sean mcguire robin williams lambeau wants to get will to use his brain while sean wants him to listen to his heart both of which he has been largely neglecting,positive
will finds that the former is much easier than the latter so much so in fact that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeaus attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle,positive
he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar minnie driver an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her,positive
what makes good will hunting work so well aside from the strong performances especially from damon and williams is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in wills life,positive
the scripts sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong,positive
lambeau while he may seem a little cold at times is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when were not sure if we like what he has to say,positive
and sean for all his warmheartedness has as lambeau and later will point out not lived up to his full intellectual potential either the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will,positive
wills reaction to this situation and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters opinions rather than setting up an obvious right and wrong side and beating them over the head with it,positive
for a film with such an extraordinary character good will hunting presents itself as remarkably ordinary it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another,positive
this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally farfetched situation,positive
good will hunting also has its share of fun humor such as when will in an early therapy session pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture,positive
and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa,positive
wills relationship with his friends most notably chucky ben affleck is usually rather amusing if somewhat crude the film has 100 uses of the f word which was most likely the reason for its rrating and lends itself well to the development of wills character,positive
add all this to the fact that good will hunting even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental and you might be wondering why i havent given this film four stars,positive
well for one thing no matter how well damon and affleck who wrote the screenplay and director gus van sant pull it off the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original,positive
there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions,positive
still good will hunting takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of 97 films,positive
do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs,positive
do you,positive
well as this movie shows us they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring,positive
unfortunately theres a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside feeling sorry for ourselves,positive
a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing and janeane garafolos character abby relates to it well,positive
like a certain oversized teenage movie critic she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive and the men seem to be backing her up on that,positive
meanwhile her gorgeous neighbor nora uma thurman,positive
uma being the only womans name worse than nora attracts men like flies,positive
as abby tells her you burp and they think its cute,positive
you barf and they line up to hold your hair back,positive
but noras down on herself for being too shallow and superficial,positive
we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abbys talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound,positive
oh come on any idiot knows how to handle that problem,positive
he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person,positive
abby though knows her body doesnt match her personality and that she probably wont have a chance with him once he sees her,positive
so she gives him noras body description and stands him up,positive
nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor,positive
she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna,positive
the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful shes not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person but he doesnt suspect anything realizing hes not living in a threes company episode,positive
the charade continues with abby furthering the relationship over the phone including a decidedly unnecessary phone sequence and nora furthering it in person while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man,positive
like sleepless in seattle this is predictable all the way through but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom,positive
the truth about cats and dogs isnt quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be but it handles well a theme i could identify with,positive
the thing is i find janeane garafolo rather attractive,positive
shes no uma but im sure in real life shed have no problems attracting men,positive
i on the other hand couldnt attract a man to save my life,positive
and am rather proud of that fact,positive
you leave little notes on my pillow,positive
i told you a million times i cant stand little notes on my pillow,positive
we are all out of corn flakes f u,positive
it took me three hours to figure out that f u was felix unger,positive
a frustrated oscar madison walter matthau running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger jack lemmon in the odd couple,positive
the classic neil simon comedy based on his own stage play about suicidal felix lemmon who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar matthau to stay with him in his apartment after felixs wife throws him out and files for divorce,positive
the hook oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way while felix is an neat freak,positive
the two men despite their friendship instantly clash,positive
movies just arent as delightfully funny as this one is,positive
every line of neil simons dialogue flows like comedic poetry and all the actors are just perfect in their performances,positive
lemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix but its matthau who shines brightest as oscar whose world is being invaded and rearranged mostly against his wishes the type of character i always enjoy identifying with,positive
and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti,positive
the best thing about the film and this is a testament to the quality of the writing is that its a comedy with substance,positive
these two men even while at each others throats genuinely care for one another as friends,positive
when they clash it isnt cartoonish hatred being displayed but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to coexist,positive
movies nowadays take grumpy old men for example just dont have that extra spark there,positive
these days its just animosity for the sake of comedy,positive
a television series followed starring jack klugman and tony randall which ill admit ive never seen an episode of in its entirety and neil simon even scripted the sequel the odd couple ii which was released in 1998,positive
neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though,positive
its one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films,positive
in some respects rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking,positive
the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone,positive
the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble,positive
all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element,positive
the duo must always be completely mismatched,positive
the hero has to say some smartassed comment before and after shooting someone,positive
however that doesnt necessarily make for a bad film,positive
rush hour is jackie chans first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector 1985,positive
proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ie hong kong jackie chan is given much more free reign than before,positive
still some diehard jackie chan fans may be disappointed as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes which he views as too short according to one interview,positive
this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west,positive
jackie chan is lee the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case while chris tucker is carter the loudmouthed destructive cop that is promoted to the fbi to help him,positive
or at least so he thinks also another classic notion in action films the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes,positive
despite the necessary conventions of action films rush hour is some of the most fun youll spend and hour and forty minutes watching,positive
jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches,positive
chris tucker familiar from his whiny annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable complementing jackie chans straightlaced character,positive
however jackie chan still maintains his comicslapstick edge as expected of him and his films,positive
perfectly downplaying the fishoutofwater routine through his characters attempts at mixing into american culture he makes up for the down time his character experiences,positive
when he is in action however youll be amused and dazzled,positive
still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up in this case a steering wheel a serving tray and a barstool jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu,positive
chris tuckers character may come across as irritating yet is also humorous,positive
since hes not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan he uses his main weapon his mouth hence the tagline fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west,positive
while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare it is appropriate for the film and still very funny,positive
while not necessarily poignant attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well,positive
lees knowledge of american pop culture thats the beach boys,positive
when contrasted against carters lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick while carter teaches lee hiphop dance moves,positive
while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 known in north america as supercop and jackie chans first strike respectively it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr nice guy,positive
with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs it makes for a fun film,positive
as well it is a true departure from jackie chan films as it is missing one common element a whiny female costar,positive
my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance or a movie that weve all seen a million times two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins,positive
this is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way,positive
the movie starts with a quick and i do mean quick glance of two presidents russell kramer jack lemmon and matt douglas james garner,positive
william haney dan aykroyd and ted matthews john heard are the new president and vice president,positive
there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago,positive
he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead,positive
this movie was exceptional for many reasons,positive
one being that they found people lemmon and garner that have good chemisty together,positive
they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly one being a ladies man and one being the old man ill let you fiqure which is which,positive
also they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well,positive
it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman except then he was a congressman,positive
experience counts for a lot,positive
ingredients starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood,positive
synopsis great expectations 1998 is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel,positive
in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havishams snobbish adopted daughter estella,positive
the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class gentleman,positive
pip leaves for london with great expectations to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella,positive
but life has a way of complicating things,positive
pip becomes an arrogant s o b,positive
until he learns just who his secret benefactor is,positive
in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ethan hawke with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict robert de niro,positive
but soon the focus of finns life becomes romance as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella gwyneth paltrow an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment,positive
estella was raised in wealth by ms dinsmoor anne bancroft an eccentric aged and embittered manhating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage,positive
this causes estella to fear the daylight of relationships but finn thinks its just a case of snobbery,positive
when finn becomes a young man an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist,positive
finn leaves florida with great expectations to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella,positive
what will happen to all of finns great expectations,positive
opinion if youre looking for a romance with a happy ending look no further youve found one here,positive
ethan hawke is romantic lead,positive
he romanced winona ryder in reality bites,positive
he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise,positive
he romanced uma thurman in gattaca,positive
now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow a railthin blonde,positive
hawke plays a lovestruck earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film,positive
meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess estellas whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate,positive
anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms dinsmoor while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably,positive
the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love whereas great expectations 1998 is more artsy less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease,positive
this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueffs play hospitality suite its,positive
about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention whose chicago company has sent them to wichita where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of a big industrial corporation,positive
he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention,positive
the big kahuna revels in salesmentalk among the three white christian males two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesmen having teamed together for the last twelve years while bob facinelli is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department,positive
these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite,positive
the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life,positive
the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why,positive
what comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living,positive
these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch,positive
their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical,positive
following in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of a salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high,positive
in this case it is landing the big kahuna,positive
they each are trying to see why hes on top and why they are chasing after him,positive
what makes this film different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do as both must sell their product,positive
and how after each ones psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each,positive
the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen,positive
larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life,positive
bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ,positive
his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in,positive
bob is a baptist who takes a very nonquestioning and literal attitude about religion,positive
to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he reads the bible,positive
when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and cant even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred to him,positive
the contrast in their personalities is stark,positive
larry is all business he simply wants to close the sale,positive
he comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman,positive
he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burnedout,positive
he tells him to go on a vacation,positive
get a woman,positive
while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long,positive
he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in,positive
he has always been a charmer shaking everyones hand trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale,positive
larry is more aggressive as a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale,positive
in contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him,positive
this is his first time for him on the road,positive
when dick fuller doesnt arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering,positive
when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account,positive
but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act as the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another mans name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus,positive
bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend,positive
larry and phil cant fathom how bob didnt make a sales pitch,positive
but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fullers attention about their companys product as they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room,positive
these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass,positive
the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives,positive
these three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance,positive
the only problem with the film is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience,positive
but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see,positive
oh my god i sounded just like a mother,positive
mrs pascal played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold tells her son,positive
didnt i sound just like a mother,positive
you are a mother her son marty tells her disgustedly,positive
i know but i still cant believe it,positive
i look at you people and wonder how did you ever fit in my womb,positive
marty you see is a grownup twin,positive
although his sister who thinks she is jackieo is certifiably insane marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes,positive
mother and daughter played in a brilliant performance by parker posey are both varying degrees of wacko,positive
most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and meanspirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is,positive
the daughters fantasy of being jackieo is probably the most sane part of her being,positive
mrs pascal is the sort that will not let jackieo keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level,positive
she explains to martys new fiancee lesly tori spelling soon after their first meeting that jackieo was holding martys private part when she came out of the womb,positive
the dialog by wendy macleod based on the play by mark waters is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment,positive
the script reminiscent of a david mamet play flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters,positive
the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the familys out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane,positive
in this storm are two sane individuals,positive
the fiancee is a giddy schoolgirl type embarrassed by everything a complete contrast to her rival jackieos bitter pseudosophistication,positive
as the two twins younger brother anthony freddie prinze jr plays the allamerica boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brothers fiancee that night,positive
we all have our secrets jackieo tells her potential sisterinlaw and boy does she have a few,positive
this is a house filled with them,positive
when lesly calls it the familys home to mrs pascal theyve never had a visitor before lesly mrs pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their house,positive
in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase made for each other the twins biggest but not their only secret is that theyve had a longterm incestuous relationship,positive
they dont like to discuss it although they are not particularly ashamed of it,positive
perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy this story never pulls its punches,positive
jackieo tries in many ways few subtle to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his,positive
in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackieo pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands,positive
marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy,positive
the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing,positive
they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world,positive
their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best,positive
director mark waters keeps the shows energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace,positive
his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it,positive
jackieo is temperamentally incapable of being nice,positive
and being jealous she cuts lesly down mercilessly,positive
were you poor,positive
jackieo asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished,positive
did you eat pies,positive
chicken pot pies,positive
pancakes actually lots of pancakes lesly replies with her usual sincerity,positive
a donut king so is she like the queen,positive
jackieo cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king,positive
are we entertaining royalty,positive
with rolfe kents whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed,positive
will it end in a big emotional explosion a murder people slowly cutting each other up with words a familial catharsis a weather disaster or what,positive
the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell,positive
ill not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise,positive
the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 25,positive
it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations mature themes violent overtones and some profanity,positive
the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers i e treat the movie as it were rated nc17,positive
scream 2 isnt quite as clever as its predecessor but it fills the gap with a cutting wit,positive
death even gruesome bloody death can be funny if handled the right way some will be offended by this statement but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example,positive
and while theres plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 the latest 90s slasher flick incarnation there are also a few laughs to be had,positive
scream 2 is a sliceanddice movie for those who dont take their horror too seriously,positive
the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise,positive
the unexpected blockbuster whose gross soared over the 100 million mark during its six month release window opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time,positive
a sequel was inevitable fortunately nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 including director wes craven screenwriter kevin williamson and actors neve campbell courtney cox david arquette jamie kennedy and liev schreiber,positive
as stipulated by one of the rules of sequels uttered by a movie obsessed character in the film the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original,positive
paradoxically theres a lot less gore,positive
there is blood of course but nothing excessive by slashermovie standards and there are no depictions of spilled entrails,positive
craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids,positive
a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cutout stereotypes lined up for slaughter,positive
after all weve known some of these people for two movies its almost impossible not to care about them at least a little,positive
scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original,positive
as in the first picture theres a slick selfmocking prologue,positive
this time the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab which is based on the true life events of scream,positive
some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films its surely no coincidence that in addition to pinkett and epps scream 2 features two black characters,positive
shortly thereafter she and her boyfriend have been gutted signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders,positive
craven lets loose a burst of tongueincheek creativity for the movie within a movie sequences,positive
they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream an act that he accomplishes with great panache,positive
stab features heather graham in the casey becker role played in the original by drew barrymore and tori spelling as sidney prescott neve campbell,positive
sadly we only see a couple of scenes from stab,positive
it would have been a little more fun i think had craven used joe dantes approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production,positive
following the prologue we are reintroduced to sidney prescott who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college,positive
her friend randy jamie kennedy is a student there as well and hes just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever,positive
once the double murder at stab becomes big news the media converges on windsor looking to interview the original victim,positive
at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers courtney cox who has a little surprise for sidney,positive
she has brought cotton weary liev schreiber the man sidney falsely accused of murder with her,positive
also arriving at the college is deputy dewey david arquette who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations,positive
in addition to the survivors from the original scream the field of potential victims is wellpopulated,positive
theres a blond coed named cece sarah michelle gellar who has now appeared in two of williamsons movies this one and i know what you did last summer sidneys requisite boyfriend derek jerry oconnell a local newswoman laurie metcalf gales new cameraman duane martin a british drama teacher david warner and several sorority sisters and wouldbe sorority sisters portia de rossi rebecca gayheart elise neal marisol nichols,positive
ultimately there are lots of attractive corpses,positive
from the stab scenes to lines like brothers dont last long in situations like this craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 and the movie is enjoyable if a little overlong the livelier first hour is better than the second,positive
their resolution to the obligatory whodunit,positive
is less of a letdown than it could be and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes,positive
nice twist quips the killer,positive
didnt see it coming didya,positive
one senses however that by the end of this picture the overall concept of a hip selfreferential slasher film has been played out,positive
supposedly theres going to be a scream 3 but if the film makers dont come up with something radical we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill,positive
the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereaus intimacy has already garnered much notoriety but its in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance angels insects and kerry fox welcome to sarajevo that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered,positive
with sharp intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols,positive
their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty in the acceptance of flesh and messiness,positive
less apparent but no less remarkable are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance often without a single line of dialogue,positive
not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development,positive
that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile sensory level,positive
the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis,positive
intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of human interconnectedness and pinteresque rummages through psychological dirty drawers okay kill me,positive
shallow though it might sound its amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast perceptive camerawork and imaginative ways of treating the love scene,positive
those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake especially since they are the substance of the cake itself,positive
adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london,positive
every wednesday jay rylance and claire fox meet in his cluttered dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives,positive
hes been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years,positive
shes a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction,positive
theyre both married but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation,positive
as the weeks draw on jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claires personal routines,positive
in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is he opens wounds that hadnt existed before by singlehandedly corrupting the fantasy,positive
if it werent for a few unnecessary subplots involving jays brother and his bevy of disgruntled coworkers this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment,positive
chareaus restless camera once again wielded by superb and everattentive cinematographer eric gautier is less appropriate here than in his family transitoriented those who love me can take the train,positive
the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines,positive
these are often captured in lingering unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes,positive
separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room crawling across the floor to meet in the center,positive
despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters youd be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image,positive
intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lowermiddle class with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces viewing them with sympathy scraped raw,positive
an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall the robust scenestealer of many a mike leigh collaboration,positive
as claires cuckolded husband this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and selfeffacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk,positive
bangs in his eyes his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic gleaming mark rylance whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble but spall is no one to trifle with,positive
his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile his pointed questions only na ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations,positive
in his unassuming way spalls carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year but maybe also one of the best,positive
hes that good,positive
i rented brokedown palace last night blind having heard nothing about it beforehand and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws,positive
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety,positive
that is no easy task,positive
superficially it bears an unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance to several other movies notably return to paradise and midnight express,positive
as a result nearly every review of brokedown palace i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons,positive
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation which is a shame as this is a fine film,positive
for those who have yet to view the movie let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system as was midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of return to paradise,positive
in my view if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrads acclaimed novel lord jim,positive
problematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious setup involving a suave conman a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world justice system,positive
the girls are alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale,positive
theyre lifelong buddies who planned a highschool graduation trip to hawaii and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents,positive
once there they find a 6 hotel and go sightseeing which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside,positive
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them but they are saved from hotel security by a charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girls scam,positive
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves first toward alice then toward darlene,positive
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers,positive
the everpresent nick is too slick and his stories dont add up to us the girls of course are too naive to notice,positive
long before it happens were anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fasttalking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sittingducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin,positive
just as predictably the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prisonbound for a long stretch,positive
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice,positive
for those in need of a ready answer might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girls fleabag hotel,positive
as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate yankee hank bill pullam and his thaiborn partnerwife,positive
a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the films tag lines who do you trust and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar with pullmans oeuvre will find few surprises,positive
much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in shorthand fashion,positive
lou diamond phillips for instance plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank withholds vital information at crucial moments,positive
is he part of a wider conspiracy,positive
with an inherently powerful if somewhat tired premise the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama a prison story and a potential character study of american teens their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them,positive
the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful with the girls interaction hanks investigation and the various trials and hearings offering hope for their release delivering tensionas does the foredoomed possibility of their escape,positive
if brokedown palace has a major flaw it is its creators tendency like timeconstrained tourists to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction halfway down and return to the storys main avenue,positive
and if that were all there was to brokedown palace it wouldnt be a very good movie,positive
but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and in this they succeeded,positive
for the main theme of the movie like the proffered name of its location is freedomin all its permutations,positive
ultimately the other subthemes may be considered window dressing,positive
young and pretty alice danes is an old soul a wild streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure,positive
presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang dark and light is her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale,positive
cleareyed and straightforward alice is more complex than her friend,positive
she comes from a poorer background has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone including her own father,positive
whereas darlenes life is ontrack aimed at college marriage kids a career a suburban home middle age and fulfillment alices is uncertain unfocused and yearning,positive
one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitorsfriends and relatives from home whose lives continue while hers is in limbo,positive
tellingly alice is present but not included,positive
just as revealing of their different personalities when alice and dar first come to thailand the openness and delight on alices face doesnt read as simple naivet the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat reaching toward the sun she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom while dar remains seated in the shade,positive
brokedown palace begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank,positive
however unintentional its all alices fault,positive
shes responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick,positive
in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a films beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison,positive
dar of course is the willing dupe which in her view confers innocence,positive
never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate,positive
dar is innocent,positive
it doesnt matter,positive
alice is the subject of this movie,positive
she and her journey toward personal freedom,positive
along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their halfbaked sensibilities and materialistic goals,positive
in the end that culture like its representatives yankee hank and dars father a man who knows how to grease the wheels proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girls tragedy,positive
thailands culture contrary to most opinion comes off much better by comparison,positive
it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes,positive
i believe the filmmakers view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior,positive
the thai with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles,positive
the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the nativeborn,positive
their prison in stark contrast to the probable reality was no hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit,positive
the prison authorities demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted of picking grass,positive
the thai guards were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic,positive
as for the thai justice system the reasoning of the thai judges during both an appeal hearing and in the films penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality,positive
freedom has many faces and brokedown palace explores many of them,positive
in the extreme we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit,positive
some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter,positive
but freedom seldom comes without a price,positive
which is why the movies other tag lines are what is your dream,positive
and how far would you go,positive
i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated or not by films end is alice,positive
she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility,positive
i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact,positive
kate beckinsales character might more properly be likened to the released temple bird referred to twice during the film trained to fly back to its cage,positive
as the thai magistrate observed in the films climactic scene the issue was always one of character and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that freedom is achieved within oneself,positive
if one thinks back over the movie which character was transformed by their experiences,positive
increasingly the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of kung fu womanfemale characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures,positive
here at last is the story of a modern heroine,positive
in reading the many users comments i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon whether or not a person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actors,positive
think about that,positive
when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it but raving about all the performances in it,positive
do yourself a favor rent brokedown palace and watch it with a open mind,positive
theres more there than meets the eye,positive
we all know the fate of childs play which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially sequel hell,positive
with the newest installment in the quasipopular series currently out that would be bride of chucky and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five its kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original a task which is a retread for some and for others namely myself a chance to see what all the fuss was about,positive
alas the original childs play actually isnt that bad,positive
even seeing it in the tiny claustrophobic and mechanicallychallenged theatre at my college wasnt the horribly dull experience i thought it would be not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd which you almost need to watch a film like this and if you dont believe me try and watch this flick by yourself one day but because as a whole this isnt a bad movie,positive
its not great but it does have two things that many horror films like this one dont have 1 a rather nifty premise and 2 a sense of humor both which save this from horror hell which is precisely where say i know what you did last summer has recently gone,positive
the premise of childs play is that a serial killer named charles lee ray brad douriff is shot and almost killed by a chicago hardboiled detective chris surrandon see what happens to some oscar nominees and before he dies utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kids doll called chucky a doll which has got to be the scariestlooking kids doll ive ever seen,positive
the next day a bum whos stolen it sells it to singlemother karen barclay catherine hicks who then gives it to her young son andy alex vincent for his birthday,positive
of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll but certain twists come up,positive
like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll that being andy,positive
and soon enough chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun and people are discovering that chucky isnt just a kiddie doll one by one,positive
the idea is a neat one ripe for lots of comic terror and luckily it utlizes a lot of that,positive
it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive they tell people about it but when he tries to prove themselves chucky does nothing and everyone thinks theyre crazy,positive
it plays with this as well as the whole childlike thought that dolls and toys come to life and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments,positive
even if theres an entire sequence devoted to cliches a woman alone in a house hears a noise goes to investigate it and finds nothing but wait for the kicker a second later,positive
theres also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience,positive
the ending is rather fun as well albeit a tad too drawnout about four different endings maybe five and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film lineup making them easier to sympathize with,positive
if theres one horrible thing about many horror films its that the protagonists are morons who you cant help but shout obscenities at and for the most part childs play steers away from that,positive
and most of all the chucky character is a good one not just because he provides instant comic relief look,positive
that dolls moving on its own but because hes a generally scary character,positive
if theres anything really wrong with childs play its that its too trite and has too less self esteem,positive
at almost 90 minutes childs play features way too less to be a real classic of horror,positive
it throws itself into a simple three act setup that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it werent for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll,positive
if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film which,positive
isnt necessarily a bad thing,positive
as such childs play is content to be just the short typical horror film but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasicampy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short typical horror film,positive
the first thing you notice about this movie is that its cold,positive
placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snowcovered ground against a background of white,positive
just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night,positive
as with most coen brothers films this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes each of which works out in the oddest way possible,positive
a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father,positive
along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does,positive
in brief scenes of vicious violence people get shot through the head in the back face chest and various other areas of the anatomy,positive
there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen,positive
remarkably enough most of the movie is played for laughs,positive
even more remarkably it works,positive
the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff frances mcdormand who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity,positive
with every good film the audience gains new knowledge,positive
here you learn two things,positive
everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy,positive
and dont do violent illegal business with lowlife amoral degenerate scumsucking losers,positive
oh yeah if you get shot in the face using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy,positive
clint eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another,positive
midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwooddirected film clint isnt even in and its damn good,positive
adapted from a bestselling john berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head,positive
and thats just the mayor,positive
as director and producer eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent 150 minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor,positive
like all great movies midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion,positive
the acting from bigtime stars john cusack and kevin spacey is as good as youd expect but its the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm,positive
cusack plays a freelance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spaceys parties,positive
lots of food beverages and gunplay,positive
yes an employee of spaceys has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead,positive
it seems like a simple matter of self defense the guy threatened spacey shot at him missed then spacey took him out but being a movie theres much more to it than that and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in,positive
the weird circle of entertainment,positive
this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in,positive
theres the requisite sexy woman alison nepotists daughter eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite,positive
miss chablis deserves a paragraph of own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony,positive
chablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul but never seems exploited as the movies comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie,positive
there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating,positive
certainly the characterizations of the judge and spaceys lawyer both help immensely as does having the flyguy as the jurys foreman,positive
its here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spaceys homosexuality,positive
yes spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course,positive
midnight in the garden of good and evil isnt a classic but it is one of the better celebritydirected truestory bestseller adaptations out there,positive
likewise no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations but the performances are all great,positive
in fact id almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category,positive
serving america for more than 125th of a century,positive
slavery is bad,positive
after hundreds of years weve finally figured that one out,positive
this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielbergs latest serious film,positive
during the late 1830s a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africas west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery,positive
fiftythree of them are stuffed into the la amistad from a spanish word for friendship by their new spanish owners,positive
freeing himself from his chains senge pieh djimon hounsou renamed cinque by his masters leads a bloody revolt,positive
after killing most of the crew the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home or so they think,positive
instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states,positive
the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy,positive
the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property,positive
if they are property who do they belong to,positive
their masters,positive
the spanish government,positive
salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship,positive
the us government,positive
the defendants are pawns in several games,positive
abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard want to free them but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause,positive
their lawyer roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees,positive
south carolina senator john c calhoun arliss howard pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states,positive
president martin van buren nigel hawthorne is willing to force the result towards his own political ends,positive
when the verdict looks to free the africans van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes,positive
even that doesnt work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims,positive
at the urging of calhoun the president then appeals the case to the supreme court populated by a majority of slaveowners,positive
this littleknown try finding it in any history text book incident from americas past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court,positive
the slavery issue is easy pickins for spielberg,positive
much like his shindlers list which followed jurassic park as this follows lost world the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose,positive
nazis and slave traders both treat groups of others as less than human,positive
its not hard to see who the bad guys are,positive
without that question to ponder the directors job is more difficult,positive
he has to make the story interesting,positive
spielberg succeeds for the most part,positive
the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach,positive
where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle,positive
there are very few people in the tale,positive
in fact cinque is the only character who is fleshed out,positive
tappan and joadson are abolitionists symbols but not humans,positive
van buren is a weak politician but nothing else,positive
the rest of the slaves barely exist other than dressing for the set,positive
like many other films about people of color almost all the major players are white,positive
the films salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou,positive
the former models first major role is a winner,positive
without speaking more than five words of english he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog,positive
the other standout is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents he also played the title role in nixon,positive
the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best courtroom drama ever on the screen,positive
there are some other great moments,positive
especially impressive are the africans struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land,positive
their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant,positive
as grand as the epic is it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans,positive
more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a fourstar film,positive
michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films,positive
ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon the book of the dead,positive
bruce campbell stars as ash who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods and his friends who have become demons including his own girlfriend,positive
the results shown on screen are amazing considering the films tiny budget constant location changes and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years,positive
followed by two sequels evil dead ii 1987 and army of darkness 1993,positive
the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 33 1,positive
the disc contains two versions of the films audio a stereo 2 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 1,positive
included are two separate running commentary tracks the first features sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the films star bruce campbell,positive
campbells commentary is informative and extremely witty as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film,positive
such informative tidbits include the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was its title and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard,positive
also theres a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which theyve found thats explaining about the demonic forces in the woods,positive
for that scene it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana so being the wacky kids that they were at the time they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene,positive
almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actors had never smoked before and as a result they became confused and were unable to perform the scene,positive
i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam tapert audio track,positive
the two people youd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all,positive
dont get me wrong here when they do speak its entertaining to hear but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time,positive
sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask have anything to say sam,positive
to me thats not a good sign,positive
also it seems like sam raimi doesnt remember much about the film and its production,positive
well compared to rob and bruce anyway,positive
also included on the disc is a photo gallery which includes pictures from the films gala premiere and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film,positive
this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques,positive
overall the evil dead is a good low budget horror film superior to many films in its genre,positive
and the collectors edition dvd release is well worth your time if youre either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process,positive
all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining,positive
like the wonderful 1990 drama awakenings starring robin williams and robert de niro at first sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks,positive
since awakenings was so very good and made my top ten list the year it was released at first sight is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall but is still an intelligent and vibrantlyacted drama,positive
the film begins as amy mira sorvino a stressedout new york architect decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country,positive
at the hotel she is staying at she makes a massage appointment and after a long soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only to find out later that he is actually blind,positive
amy doesnt really care if he has a handicap or not and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love,positive
once she has returned to new york amy begins to research on virgils certain type of retinal blindness which he has had since three years of age and out of a stroke of luck comes into contact with a doctor bruce davison who believes he can repair virgils sight even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history,positive
at first reluctant virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery much to the hesitance of his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis,positive
ultimately the surgery is a success but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees since he has never visually seen anything before only touched objects,positive
he moves into amys apartment and she is eager to stand by him but virgils maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship,positive
on the basis of the overall story at first sight is indeed a film that has been done many times before and owes a great deal to its predecessor awakenings,positive
what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance,positive
however what helps at first sight rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy,positive
usually romantic pictures are of the shameless puppydog sort the recent tom ryanstarrer youve got mail immediately pops to mind but with this film i grew to care more about the characters and their plight,positive
the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil,positive
the massaging sequences were strangely erotic maybe even more so than the later actual love scenes and as their romantic involvement quickly developed the film was both entertaining and sweet and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two,positive
these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting peaceful life in the country to amys eventful life in the big city,positive
the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board,positive
val kilmer usually cast in the macho type of role was always believable as a blind person and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears,positive
it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity but to sympathize with and he pulled it off,positive
mira sorvino who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995s hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for which she won a welldeserved oscar as a kindhearted but ditzy hooker is a standout here,positive
although she has made some mediocre film choices since then 1997s mimic 1998s the replacement killers she always has managed to come out unscathed and it is with at first sight that she finally has another juicy role to play,positive
in a truthful climactic scene set in amys apartment between she and virgil sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces,positive
kelly mcgillis who could have easily come off as the bad onedimensional sister instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother,positive
finally nathan lane who is usually a little too overthetop is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist,positive
the one misstep of at first sight is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil,positive
very little is ever said or discussed concerning it and when the surgery occurs it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes,positive
perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more indepth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences but i would personally take realism even if it is graphic any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder,positive
in awakenings the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed,positive
because of how strong the screenplay written by steve levitt is in the way it deals with the main relationship and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino the films few problems can be swept over to the side,positive
the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is no doubt in respect to the reallife couple that the film was inspired by who are still together after many years even though the setting of the film was changed to new york,positive
since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies at first sight comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace,positive
marie charlotte rampling aberdeen and jean bruno cremet sorcerer are a comfortable sixtyish married couple looking forward to a peaceful vacation at their second home in lit et mix,positive
on their first full day marie sunbathes as jean goes for a swim,positive
hours later maries initiated a full scale search when jean hasnt returned but no trace of him is found,positive
marie returns to paris and resumes her life including chats with jean at the end of each day in francois ozons under the sand,positive
maries expat british friend amanda alexandra stewart frantic and her french husband gerard pierre vernier try to snap marie out of her denial with a dinner party where they introduce her to the handsome vincent jacques nolot nenette et boni yet marie suggests that gerard accompany her and jean to their gym the next morning,positive
eventually marie does begin dating vincent but she discusses him with jean and even smiles at jean hidden behind a bedroom curtain when she makes love to vincent,positive
slowly though reality continues to chip away at maries fantasy life,positive
her bank advises her that without access to jeans account she needs to reduce her spending,positive
one of her university students shes reading virginia woolfs the waves turns out to be one of the young men who participated in the beach search,positive
then police arrive asking her to identify the clothing of a body theyve found washed up from the ocean,positive
that night jeans not at home when she returns to their apartment,positive
her motherinlaw andree tainsy cruelly,positive
insists that jean simply abandoned her out of boredom,positive
finally marie goes to the police insisting on viewing the body,positive
horrified shes been warned it was,positive
in an advanced state of putrefaction she laughs when handed a bagged watch insisting that this is not her husband,positive
under the sand is a character study and melancholy portrait of aging ive lost my youth marie declares and loss,positive
charlotte rampling given the chance to portray an older yet still sexual woman runs with it bringing us into the mind of the character,positive
her chemistry with bruno cremet is startlingly natural,positive
as marie returns from her first date with vincent she sits on the couch with jean,positive
did he kiss you he asks,positive
the mood the two create is incredibly intimate and sad,positive
ozon water drops on burning rocks see the sea who cowrote the script with emmanuelle bernheim marcia romano and marina de van has turned in a more mature work than his previous creepy see the sea,positive
while he cleverly never lets us see jean enter the water that fateful day leaving a number of possibilities accident suicide escape,positive
open he definitely tips his hand towards a certain outcome,positive
cinematography by antoine hiberli and jeanne lapoirie water drops on burning rocks glides around marie their 180 shot as she initially searches the oceans horizon for a sign of jean conveys her panic or captures ramplings exotic face in mood divining closeup,positive
in an inventive fantasy scene marie imagines jeans hands massaging her feet while in a state of autoarousal,positive
his two hands become four then more combined with her own becoming almost a one person orgy and recalling roman polanskis repulsion,positive
original music by philippe rombi quietly adds to the overall melancholy,positive
under the sand is a unique portrait of loss,positive
it would make an fascinating double bill with liv ullmanns faithless from earlier this year another character study of a woman facing loss for different reasons,positive
while watching wes andersons rushmore it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer the films antihero was not written with jason schwartzman in mind,positive
the young actor making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman,positive
schwartzman plays max a student who is more interested in his extracurricular activities such as writing edgy plays like serpico and being president of the rushmore beekeepers but sees his grades suffer as a result,positive
on the brink of being thrown out he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross olivia williams and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume the great bill murray to build an aquarium on rushmores baseball field in her honour,positive
unfortunately for everyone involved blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well which gets in the way of maxs plans to woo her,positive
max is one of the bestwritten characters weve yet seen in the 90s and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age,positive
as everyone else has probably already pointed out he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman although i was reminded more of paul from the wonder years from a visual standpoint at least,positive
hopefully if he avoids typecasting as weird quirky lonertypes he should earn himself a good career,positive
bill murray is his equal as blume displaying a depth we havent yet seen from him,positive
while this isnt his best performance that honour goes to groundhog day he is still terrific here,positive
williams isnt given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray but still does fine work,positive
rushmore seems to go just a little too long but while it isnt a perfect film it is a definate mustsee for anyone who wants to see that rarity an american comingofage film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality,positive
anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should with any luck rise to even greater success,positive
the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any mans life especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances,positive
thematically in cinema love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters it is rare however for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benignis neoclassic drama life is beautiful,positive
through a central cast of father mother and son benigni demonstrates the wonderful undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times,positive
life is beautiful for guido orefice roberto benigni directing himself here for the sixth time in his career an italian jew master con man and aspiring waiter extraordinaire,positive
living in 1930s italy he lives a carefree life of good fortune it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora nicoletta braschi,positive
although dora is already engaged guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead the two have a child named joshua giorgio cantarini,positive
unfortunately for the happy family the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps,positive
it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movies theme of family love becomes the strongest,positive
although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm he relaxes the role to ensure his sons happiness,positive
now instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right,positive
benignis performance is truly a wellrounded one and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year,positive
the supports are all strong as well but the movie truly excels in its script,positive
life is beautiful is a selfproclaimed fable one which tells its story in grand twopart fashion,positive
in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a saturday night live spinoff a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot but in the movies second half the scripts circular nature becomes admirably obvious,positive
characters make reprise appearances in fine form and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plots outcome,positive
in all fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture and novice moviewatchers may take this opportunity to see their first artsy film,positive
life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone and above all is a fine thematic picture,positive
satirical films usually fall into one of two categories 1 longterm satire where everything including the jokes is somehow related on a large scale i e,positive
dr,positive
strangelove 2 situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene i e,positive
men in black,positive
whats unique about wag the dog is that it doesnt necessarily fit either of these descriptions and yet is both at the same time,positive
the result is a clever comedy based on an original smart premise even if the focus does tend to wander a bit,positive
if theres anything that affects americans the most its politics and showbusiness,positive
in this age of information and technology weve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things its gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it,positive
we need the media to bring us the most uptodate news but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking,positive
this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas and then presents an interesting scenario if politics the media coverage of politics and the entertainment industry are so closely related couldnt someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all,positive
thats the idea conrad brean de niro a professional washington spin doctor comes up with in order to restore the presidents good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election,positive
brean along with the presidents top advisor winifred ames heche fly to california to meet up with hotshot movie producer stanley motss hoffman,positive
they pitch him an idea to produce the image of a war with albania its a country no ones heard of so they people will buy it,positive
soon the wheels are in motion and the films riffing satire comes into play,positive
were inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation such as a folk singer visual and sound effects technicians and a modern style expert known as the fad king leary,positive
the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv in the movies or in the news,positive
the characters dialogue is witty and funny although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcomesque,positive
for example one scene shows motss and breans production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee,positive
motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs,positive
since its all computerenhanced anyway she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later,positive
this demonstrates the films ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise,positive
but then theres the gags and oneliners that although are humorous seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actresss name or whenever a problem emerges always responding with this is nothing,positive
by the time the film makes it to the midpoint everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens,positive
the first act is quickly paced while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film,positive
every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with and its always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it,positive
the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems headon in realistic manners,positive
however it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject,positive
as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture,positive
what had started off as a brilliant somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie,positive
still the situation comedy is quite funny especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt,positive
willie schumann a war hero motss and brean concocted,positive
truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time but think about afterwards and wag the dog at least succeeds in this respect,positive
however in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes,positive
then again its a valiant effort,positive
capsule earthy experimental difficult shockingly frank even for 1997 and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops,positive
the first few minutes of sweet sweetbacks baad asssss song yes i checked thats the correct number of ss are without dialogue just eerie montages of sounds,positive
a young boy obviously malnourished is taken in and fed up by several loving mothersurrogate figures,positive
then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation underneath the title credits thats far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life something were not used to seeing on screen,positive
this is one tough movie to swallow no matter who you are but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately,positive
i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences,positive
the plot is simple but not simpleminded,positive
sweetback hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man breaks his bonds and runs like hell,positive
along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies or at all for that matter the slums the missions the ghetto,positive
in other lesser movies sweetback would be machinegunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies in this one we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted,positive
ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x by an allwhite jury as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns and its hardly surprising why,positive
theres a good deal of sex in the movie but its handled in a way thats unsettlingly frank a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie,positive
in one scene sweetback visits a friends house in the hope of getting sanctuary there and the other man chats him up while on the toilet,positive
were not used to coming this close to people in real life let alone in the movies especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous,positive
the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles hands,positive
one scene in which a man is interrogated by the cops is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack,positive
another note ssbas is not so much antiwhite that would be too easy as antiauthority and as the movie goes on to demonstrate authority exists in many forms governments churches and even the paranoid inside of ones own mind,positive
ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet god knows,positive
full metal jacket very much like every other hardhitting film about the vietnam war is an shocking emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america,positive
this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man private joker played by matthew modine during his tour in the vietnam war,positive
however full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before boot camp,positive
these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning,positive
as in platoon full metal jacket gets off to a quick start,positive
the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits which is getting their heads shaved,positive
from there they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman played extremely well by the former drill instructor r lee ermey,positive
apparently the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations,positive
private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence vincent donofrio whom is dubbed gomer pyle by sgt,positive
hartman,positive
the film is continually narrated by private joker in which he explains his visions on what is going on,positive
the entire corps although repeatedly hammered by sgt,positive
hartman continues on,positive
private pyle however seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor,positive
he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation and it basically does not stop,positive
that is until sgt,positive
hartman comes up with a new plan,positive
he will punish the rest of the soontobemarines for pyles goofups even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can,positive
pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits and things take a turn for the worst,positive
pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally physically and mentally cut out for the life of a marine,positive
after graduation joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war which is his service,positive
he is not a member of the infantry and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat,positive
when he sets out on a documenting mission this question becomes very clear from the start,positive
joker joins up with a platoon along with his hometown friend cowboy arliss howard and follows their everyday actions interviewing and filmming them along the way,positive
he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight or die,positive
again as in the tradition of vietnam war films full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an antiwar film or not,positive
a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide,positive
full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam as have others in the past,positive
this film in different ways also can be viewed as more powerful than others,positive
that again is up for debate and depends on your opinion,positive
one thing is for sure however no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to,positive
unfortunately many did,positive
review peter jacksons the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie and still coming in at the extremely cheap 30 million price tag,positive
but for those who were dismayed by this years blockbusters like twister and independence day the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects,positive
and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily,positive
the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a highprofile movie can get,positive
michael j fox stars as frank bannister a con artist who can speak to ghosts,positive
he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people then he comes and pretends to get rid of them,positive
this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago,positive
franks latest customers are a young couple played by trini alvarado and peter dobson,positive
when dobson ends up dead alvarado starts to take an interest in fox,positive
but dobsons spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive hes dead,positive
this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado with dobson tagging along as a ghost,positive
things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town,positive
fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims but noone else can see that,positive
so when fox shows up to try and save each victim naturally people suspect he is the killer,positive
fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collectors hit list and the last half hour of the movie deals with foxs attempts to save her from this evil spirit,positive
there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh,positive
the movie starts off as a black comedy and ends up a horroraction film,positive
the mix between these genres are perfect,positive
no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror and vice versa,positive
one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman,positive
but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form,positive
michael j fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wifes death and then is forced to confront this later on,positive
alvarado looking like andie macdowell makes a great frightened tough and smart heroine,positive
and jeffery combs as a paranoid fbi agent is brilliantly bizaare,positive
the frighteners never once feels like it is running long,positive
the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters,positive
this movie is probably what casper wouldve looked like if david lynch directed it,positive
its easily the best film of the year so far,positive
in this good natured pleasent and easy going comedy bill murray ghostbusters 1984 plays grumpy weatherman phil conners who every year is sent to punxsutawney p a to report on groundhog day,positive
the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box and if he dosent see a shadow it will be an early spring,positive
phil really hates the ceremony and not even his producer rita macdowell can change his mind,positive
however fate has a cruel trick for phil and he starts reliving groundhog day over and over and over until he gradually likes it and rita falls in love with him,positive
groundhog day is a well written totatly unoffensive and funny comedy,positive
the screenwriters director ramis and danny rubin have written a funny warm but never overly senitmental comedy,positive
although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film,positive
ramiss direction also helps and although he dosent try any flash director tricks the film is directed well enough and the jokes are set up well,positive
and the editing is also good especially when it shows one part of the day over and over again such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita,positive
the performances are also excellent,positive
bill murray is great fun and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth and delivers his lines in his usual smary style,positive
andie macdowell is good as rita although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film,positive
there is chemistry between the two leads thankfully otherwise the whole film would probably fall part,positive
chris elliot as the cameraman larry is also funny although you have to like his goofy style otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall,positive
the supporting cast arent bad either with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist,positive
in fact there is not one dud performance in this film and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase,positive
overall there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all,positive
it almost seems perfect,positive
however the film can get a bit soppy sometimes and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over and over and over and over,positive
also theres not much of an music score and the music there is is pretty bad,positive
but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all,positive
overall then groundhog day is a funny smart and also has some room in there for some heart,positive
an excellent comedy,positive
overall rating,positive

what can you say about jackie chan that hasnt already been said,positive
since the release of rumble in the bronx back in 1996 the u s release jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on americas video shelves,positive
having made over 80 films jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of actioncomedy to the west,positive
his latest release shanghai noon is a joyful tribute spoof of the classic western,positive
and by adding jackie chan into the genre the tag line for the film the western gets a kick in the pants rings true,positive
jackie stars as chon wang a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china,positive
the royal princess pei pei lucy liu is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture,positive
unwilling to follow her fathers wishes princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor decides to escape to america,positive
but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong which will lead to the princess kidnapping and ransom,positive
unable to take any legal action the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden citys bravest guards played by cui ya hi rong guang yu and eric chen are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city nevada,positive
chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team as he is looked upon as a buffoon,positive
on a train in the u s jackie meets up with bandit roy obannon owen wilson,positive
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him,positive
with his gang in tow roy attempts to rob the train when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court who also happens to be chon wangs uncle,positive
chon wang gives chase foiling the attempted robbery but also leaving himself stranded in the desert,positive
as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert he again comes upon roy who has been left for dead by his former gang,positive
buried up to his neck in the desert roy pleads with chon to dig him out,positive
chon demands to know where carson city is,positive
roy directs him and chon leaves,positive
but not before sticking two chopsticks into roys mouth and telling him to dig himself,positive
chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors a friendly sioux tribe gunslingers a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride brandon merrill before once again running into roy,positive
shanghai noon is just good fun,positive
the chemistry between the cast is remarkable,positive
the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film,positive
jackies performance is as good as anything hes done before,positive
hes not called on to do much acting here as the character is not written with any depth,positive
but jackies natural charisma shines through and his comic timing is so perfect both physically and surprise verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on,positive
owen wilson last seen in the embarrassing remake of the haunting gives a good natured performance as roy obannon,positive
his innocence is refreshing and fun,positive
a bad guy thats not really bad,positive
his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis,positive
lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant,positive
the character is a noble woman of status and wealth but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment,positive
the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances,positive
nothing here is realistic mind you,positive
shanghai noon is first and foremost a light jovial film,positive
and the performances match that style with ease,positive
the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous,positive
using calgary alberta as the prime location,positive
mr mindel is able to create a lush romantic western feel to the film,positive
nothing here really looks like nevada but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre,positive
and as such the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history but with reverence to past films,positive
homage to such films as high noon obviously red river and most notably butch cassidy the sundance kid all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film,positive
it is a comforting experience,positive
at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and dare i say clich s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing,positive
here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre,positive
this is the purest horse opera since the days of george obrian or john wayne,positive
director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywoods past,positive
in this his first film mr dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see,positive
nothing here really stands out or takes ones attention away from the story or action,positive
and that is as it should be when jackie chan is your star,positive
and what of the action and stunts,positive
well while not up to a level of drunken master 2 or any of jackies hong kong films shanghai noon is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before,positive
his timing choreography and creativity are still as sharp as ever,positive
jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films obvious to those of us that have seen those films but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar,positive
finally jackie can honestly say that he has made an u s his way and incorporating his style,positive
to sum up shanghai noon is a fun summer confection,positive
not too heavy and not too light,positive
a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy parents be advised there are scenes of smoking drunkenness and peyote use,positive
an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again,positive
i know what you did last summer the first highprofile slasher thriller to be released after 1996s scream and written by the same screenwriter kevin williamson is a stylish effective horror film that became 1997s biggest hit of the fall season,positive
while scream was a more knowing film about the genre i know what you did last summer is more reminiscent of a straightforward slasher flick but it is far more intelligent than such bottomofthebarrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the friday the 13th films well okay jason goes to hell was pure hell to sit through,positive
the film starts off with four talented aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport n c,positive
it is the 4th of july and they will soon be heading their separate ways,positive
kindhearted julie jennifer love hewitt and outsider ray freddie prinze jr will be headed off to college while helen sarah michelle gellar who has just been honored croaker queen in the town and her ignorant jock boyfriend barry ryan phillippe are going to new york to become an actress and football player,positive
when the four of them travel to a nearby mountainside beach for the evening they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home,positive
distraught and confused they decide they cant go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean in hopes no one will find him,positive
julie is apprehensive about it but is forced into it by barry,positive
switch to exactly a year later julie still unable to come to terms with what she did reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out,positive
almost immediately julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads i know what you did last summer and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook,positive
i know what you did last summer is a successful horror film for a number of reasons,positive
the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian as it put shadows fog steam and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings,positive
the characters particularly julie and helen are realistically written and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort,positive
and last the film creates a few dazzling and scary setpieces that are some of the most memorable ive seen in a horror movie particularly the suspenseful superbly shot sequence involving helen at her familys store with the killer inside with her,positive
perhaps the best character is that of missy egan anne heche a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit,positive
heches performance is a standout as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time,positive
i know what you did last summer could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems,positive
prinze jr gives a performance to be desired here and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth,positive
also the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines,positive
luckily the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale which includes an expertly crafted jumpinyourseat scare,positive
in the main roles hewitt and gellar are highly talented and hewitt especially is one of the best screamers ive ever heard,positive
she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best scream queen,positive
and gellar is touching as a young woman who in the course of one year finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered,positive
although not up to the level of either scream movies or the more recent urban legend i know what you did last summer is a respectable smartlyscripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made,positive
this is the movie not the perfume,positive
a slow moving stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcocks vertigo,positive
it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader,positive
set in new orleans 1959 it shows the wealthy michael courtland cliff robertson sitting on top of the world celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion as his lovely wife elizabeth genevi ve bujold and young daughter amy blackman both look up to him beaming with joy,positive
his realestate development partner bob la salle john lithgow proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business while his high society friends give him their best wishes,positive
upon retiring for the night his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver 500 000 tomorrow or they will be killed,positive
inspector brie stanley reyes comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange as that will lead them to the kidnappers,positive
but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase the kidnappers car explodes and goes over the bridge where none of the bodies were found,positive
grieving the loss of his wife and child the guiltridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop,positive
sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence italy where he met his wife,positive
when he goes to the church where they met he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife,positive
her name is sandra portinari genevi ve bujold and shes working there restoring art that is decaying,positive
he falls instantly in love with her and doesnt heed bobs warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her,positive
sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him,positive
the surprises to come werent really all that surprising as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ve bujold and the competent acting of john lithgow,positive
it plays too much like a rehash of the masters work to break any new ground yet it is still thrilling in its own way,positive
alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters,positive
i saw it when i was 13 years old and i must admit that i didnt like it,positive
of course i was expecting aliens again and i believe this was my fault,positive
in order to appreciate alien 3 you need to see aliens but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor,positive
james camerons aliens was an action film and many people consider it the best in the series,positive
i am among that group but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film which critics have bashed for its originality,positive
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action,positive
both are untrue because the film has quite a bit of action and the dialogue was essential and wellwritten,positive
as for the chase sequence it was long but not overly long creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion,positive
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped,positive
on the big screen i was overwhelmed by something i normally didnt see,positive
it was a very dark film and the language was extremely harsh,positive
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities,positive
dont get me wrongim not saying films should eliminate swearing but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks it gets rather distracting,positive
however since seeing it again i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters,positive
as a result alien 3s only flaw albeit a major one is the underdeveloped characters,positive
we never really care about any of them and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie,positive
there were only two characters i liked and of course one was lt ripley sigourney weaver although we have gotten to know her through two other films,positive
the other character was dr clemens charles dance but because we like him the inevitable occurs,positive
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off,positive
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry,positive
without using a single line of dialogue unless you count computer warnings fincher sets up the entire film,positive
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card,positive
we see lt ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments,positive
title,positive
a shot of an alien egg,positive
title,positive
alien legs stretch up into the air,positive
title,positive
and so on and so on,positive
during these first ten minutes i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed,positive
its quite a remarkable opening and one which will remain in my mind for a long time,positive
because of this facehugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod and sent down to the nearest planet fiorina fury161 an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison,positive
however the facehugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryotubes and is sent down with the escape pod,positive
unfortunately during the landing all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed,positive
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery,positive
of course you need a carrier for this facehugger and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates,positive
ripley is revived and asks to see the ship,positive
after seeing a mysterious acideaten section ripley asks to see the dead bodies and then have them cremated,positive
this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films,positive
featuring a monologue from dillon charles s dutton a prisoner who has found god the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dogs demise,positive
its one of the most memorable moments as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog,positive
and this is where alien 3 succeeds,positive
fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock in fact he is the mixture of both,positive
fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films,positive
alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images,positive
by doing so fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise,positive
many people have criticized finchers filming of the death scene of ripley i reveal nothing by saying this as looking too fake but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal,positive
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron a great deal of symbolism is derived,positive
i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron,positive
however most people seem to want to witness ripley die which creates a paradox as she is the character i didnt want to see die,positive
why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film and i dont plan on spoiling that in this review,positive
from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever,positive
in alien it was of course the moment the alien burst out of kanes stomach,positive
in aliens it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine,positive
alien 3 has several but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley,positive
ripley is pushed up against a wall and the alien stands inches away from her,positive
why it doesnt kill her is a shocker which later leads to a surprise ending,positive
fincher apparently loves to use closeups of actors faces michael douglas and the clown faceoff in the game in the same style and by shaving off the actors hair the only thing we have to look at is their faces,positive
many critics didnt like all the actors being bald but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot,positive
most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story but when you try to compare it to its predecessors finchers turn seems a bit gloomy and dark though thats not always a bad thing,positive
the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films with some major twists,positive
again we are setup with several different characters and one by one they are picked off,positive
however while the first two had tons of arsenal especially camerons film alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this rundown prison,positive
as a result no weapons are to be found,positive
this creates a lot of tension although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense,positive
as an alien film alien 3 is the worst of the series but by itself it is an extremely wellmade motion picture with a lot more merits than not,positive
the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the onedimensional characters,positive
i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about,positive
despite this ripley was the central figure and thats what is important,positive
we care for her even though she began to act just like one of the guys,positive
again the technical side of this film is remarkable and better than the two previous versions,positive
while camerons version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting and moody sets,positive
the cinematography by alex thomson is very well done with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie,positive
the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around,positive
the yellows reds and oranges of the lights create a dark mood and by themselves create a lot of suspense,positive
shadows dance on the walls and yet those shadows could easily be the alien,positive
the alien is different from its predecessors this time around and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense,positive
the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien racing after the characters,positive
the sets are quite incredible which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien,positive
the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed,positive
the sets appear to be in the future but not too far in the future,positive
one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien nothing surprising there,positive
sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens,positive
she was snubbed at the oscars for this one mainly because the film was a critical bomb,positive
her reactions are far more realistic in this film with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter,positive
its quite touching really,positive
charles s dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates and i was on the brink of actually caring for him,positive
charles dance turns in a nice lowkey performance and as a result i cared for him immediately,positive
lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii but he was more entertaining in aliens,positive
the rest of the cast is pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world,positive
alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language and sex,positive
although it has its flaws alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism,positive
this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie,positive
while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out,positive
its a film like finchers which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity the final scene,positive
in fact it tells us that we as a society have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little fake,positive
whenever something looks fake on screen we immediately point it out as a mistake,positive
but perhaps it isnt a mistake,positive
sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film,positive
sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride,positive
i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes,positive
surprised they may have been when they realized that this picture actually had something to say,positive
but by the attentiveness of the crowd id say they were won over as was i i cant tell yet if truman really is that good or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year,positive
time alone will make that call,positive
but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbanks side,positive
we were concerned for his wellbeing and wanted him to win,positive
that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey who has achieved legitimacy at last,positive
the truman show is a film best viewed cold with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot,positive
unless youre under a media blackout however you probably know the basics,positive
carrey stars as truman burbank a capraesque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl laura linney in the south florida island town of seahaven which looks like michael eisners idea of the perfect american small town,positive
truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle complete with a working wife a best bud friendly neighbors and interesting coworkers,positive
there is tragedy in his past his father drowned in a horrible boating accident leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water and of travel in general but overall life is good,positive
but then one day as truman leaves his house for work a klieg light falls magically from the sky,positive
this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows that he is a prisoner on the worlds biggest soundstage that his wife friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him and that his life has for over 10 000 days been broadcast as the worlds most popular television program,positive
what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir,positive
the soundstage were told is only the second manmade structure visible from space,positive
trumans movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 000 cameras scattered throughout the town button cams dashboard cams mirror cams wife cams big cams and small cams,positive
weir cuts the film so were never quite sure if were watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the shows omnipotent creator christof ed harris who oversees the show from a control room built into the manmade moon in seahavens sky,positive
the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence,positive
his best friend marlon noah emmerich always has a six pack of beer with him,positive
his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product,positive
he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town,positive
one wonders why he didnt pick up on any of this earlier but christof has an answer for this people tend to accept the reality with which theyre presented,positive
nevertheless truman begins to grow restless and dreams of escape to fiji where an old college sweetheart natasha mcelhone supposedly lives,positive
this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way,positive
by underplaying truman he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over,positive
there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon and marlon answers with bestfriend sincerity id gladly step in front of a bus for you,positive
but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof,positive
the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home and from that moment were on his side,positive
the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies havent we all at least once doubted our place in the world doubted the sincerity of those closest to us,positive
ultimately however the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator,positive
what does god really think of us,positive
does he resent our abandonment of paradise,positive
who exactly is watching us up there in the sky,positive
if you enjoy the picture as much as i did credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work,positive
as for carrey well truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play,positive
carrey is no jimmy stewart to his credit he doesnt try to be,positive
he just tries to feel the way you or i would if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us,positive
making his directorial debut actor jon favreau brings along his swingers costar vince vaughn for this tale of two mugs on a career trajectory to nowheresville,positive
favreau who also wrote the script is bobby vaughn is ricky,positive
by day they are construction workers,positive
they also are wannabe contenders but neither has had much success,positive
their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw leaving bobbys record at 551,positive
these two l a notsowise guys also work for max peter falk a midlevel mobster who is patient and understanding with bobby but who hates rickys guts,positive
max has an easy job for bobby fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz a smooth and silky sean combs,positive
bobby because of his lifelong friendship with ricky pleads with max to give his pal another chance and let him tag along to the big apple,positive
against his better judgment max agrees,positive
of course ricky a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks nearly screws up everything,positive
while bobby tries to stay calm and professional ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano,positive
the constrast in styles and the chemistry between favreau and vaughn is what makes made so enjoyable to watch,positive
favreau with his hounddog face and slowburn personality could be a modernday oliver hardy only much wiser,positive
vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle he just keeps yakking and yakking unaware of the havoc he creates,positive
yet despite bobbys constant aggravation and agitation with his partner a bond of affection and loyalty binds them,positive
the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch,positive
bobby is buttondowned tightlywound always waiting for the next shoe courtesy of ricky to drop,positive
ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates and is genuinely surprised when he comes under attack for his faux paus,positive
in new york the two lackeys are like fish out of water stumbling from one situation to another trying to keep alive,positive
combs is elegant cool and lowkey menacing as the gangsta they are sent to meet,positive
falk is amusing in his small role while famke janssen nearly breaks your heart as bobbys lowlife girlfriend,positive
more than anything made is a movie with heart,positive
it is loud obnoxious and very talkative,positive
but the cameraderie between bobby and ricky holds the key to its interest,positive
favreau does a commendable job in his directorial debut,positive
he is a player to be watched as he can only improve with experience,positive
it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a lessthansavoury character as mel gibson does in payback,positive
of course if i was being paid 25 million for one months work id probably be willing to take risks as well but thats neither here nor there,positive
payback is based on a novel by richard stark apparently actually donald e westlake author of the grifters itself a fine crime film which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin,positive
the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back by whom we dont know yet,positive
all we know is that gibson as porter isnt a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences,positive
it turns out that the man hes after is val gregg henry his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters,positive
obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers,positive
porter however is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the doublecrossing val,positive
gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesnt mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants,positive
you probably wouldnt see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat outofcharacter role such as porter jim carrey wont be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone,positive
harrison fords idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin which we wont mention further and has stallone ever really played a villain at all,positive
this is not to say that porter is a villain per se,positive
while he isnt the sort of character you wouldnt want to get on the wrong side of hes nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their righthand men just to prove how mean they are,positive
porter is only trying to get back what is notsorightfully his which in a way is almost understandable,positive
payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedythriller which wont be remembered as being among gibsons most important work but is still one of the finer films hes done,positive
the only real problem with it is that while everything seems to work out in the end i was left feeling something was lacking was that all,positive
the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voiceover doesnt ring true even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the filmnoir style the rest of the film embodies,positive
the film just ends far too suddenly after a huge buildup in the penultimate scenes,positive
a fine film even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation,positive
just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending,positive
plot a dude and his brother are driving crosscountry and decide to fool around with a trucker on their cb radio,positive
it isnt long before their little prank gets someone put into a coma long story and the next thing you know the trucker is following them too,positive
lotsa nuttiness ensues and then they pick up their other friend venna a girl who the dude has a crush on,positive
but whats this,positive
the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers,positive
you bet,positive
buckle up dorothy this is gonna be one bumpy ride,positive
critique a good ol time at the movies,positive
heres a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesnt really bring anything new to the forefront if youve seen flicks like duel and breakdown youve crossed this path before but still manages to entertain you gangbusters with realistic situations believable characters funny moments thrills chills the whole shebang,positive
lets give it up for director john dahl who continues to put out solid films every other year if you havent seen red rock west do yourself a favor right now and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience,positive
and much like that film this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace,positive
it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters and then shows you how one small prank can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone,positive
paul walker really surprised me in this movie since ive never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face and damn is it ever pretty or what,positive
but here he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and thats always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters,positive
sobieski is also good but she isnt in the movie for as long as youd think but the man who really takes this film to another level is steve zahn,positive
if youve loved this guy as the goofball in most of his previous roles youll appreciate him even more here as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings ive seen in quite some time this is so awesome,positive
only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick,positive
and speaking of the ending boy does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what,positive
the arrow and i were practically in each others arms well maybe im exaggerating but you catch my drift as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn took it all to an even higher level,positive
once again kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity suspense and tension with a great score editing style and camerawork,positive
plotwise i too did wonder how the bad guy was able to track them so well but it didnt really bother me all that much you can assume that he had bugged their car,positive
but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldnt help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance,positive
a great movie with an even cooler ending this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year,positive
this is amazing,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
american psycho 1010 deep blue sea 810 eye of the beholder 410 the fast and the furious 710 final destination 810 the glass house 610 no way out 810,positive
jacques tatis 1953 classic les vacances de m hulot also known as mr hulots vacation in english ought to be the textbook on how to do non dialogue comedy in film,positive
the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly and the film operates on the paper thin premise that monsieur hulot played by tati himself is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a weeks vacation,positive
yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory,positive
part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags,positive
slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash facefirst into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people dont watch where theyre going,positive
in les vacances de m hulot the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively lowkey,positive
in one sequence for example hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when while his back is turned the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves washes away then comes back up on the other side of the boat,positive
while crossing over to get the can hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it,positive
when he actually takes the boat out into the water it breaks in half but the two halves flip up against each other trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues,positive
tati doesnt waste a single opportunity for humor scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film,positive
it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audiences expectations and les vacances de m hulot succeeds brilliantly in that area as well,positive
tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement,positive
when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume no fights or shouting matches ensue instead the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark,positive
tati also uses running gags to this effect allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would more often than not we can see them coming and think oh hes not going to do that again but lo and behold he does,positive
for example there is a recurring joke in which hulots noisy sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotels lights coming on one by one,positive
then this image turns up again in the finale which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce,positive
the ending is one of two elements that really make this a fourstar film as opposed to merely an aboveaverage clever comedy,positive
as much as i was laughing during this film i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience suffice it to say that he did,positive
the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters,positive
it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him alternatively it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons,positive
instead tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them however strange or irritating they might seem,positive
les vacances de m hulot is not subtitled but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events,positive
anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store,positive
note les vacances de m hulot was not rated by the mpaa,positive
it would at most receive a pg rating,positive
i guess its a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating comedy of chris tucker,positive
im a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick but show off his comic timing as well,positive
it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title,positive
the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects,positive
this time around the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan john lone who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states im still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones,positive
the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns,positive
of course its up to hong kong detective lee chan and trashtalking lapd detective james carter tucker to take the bad guys out and the authorities to the extent that they even exist stay out of their way,positive
rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here its carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out,positive
i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan,positive
he refuses to shut up,positive
not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head but his jokes just arent funny a pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny,positive
i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates but didnt anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was,positive
if this is all the comedian has to offer then i dont care to see any more of his films,positive
fortunately chan makes for a marvelous straight man and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely,positive
its not often that one actor can so completely save a movie but there is no other name for what he does whenever hes on screen rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking often hilarious life,positive
much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a player but who cares,positive
i can think of few high concepts that are funnier,positive
the movie ends with outtakes that as usual show that chan isnt perfect and that it does indeed take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless,positive
chris tucker botches some lines as well and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie,positive
a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isnt very different from its predecessor in tone or style,positive
but i liked the original and i like the sequel though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it,positive
director brett ratner the family man keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works,positive
its not great jackie chan but its jackie chan and thats enough,positive
up next jay and silent bob strike back,positive
what is freedom,positive
how does one determine who is free,positive
in 1839 those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now,positive
yet the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations,positive
that is in essence what steven spielbergs gripping drama amistad is about,positive
through its various dramas spielberg presents a case about a group of africans who after being seized from their home were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard la amistad,positive
on their way there the slaves led by cinque djimon hounsou rebelled killing off part of the crew,positive
however the ship was still directed towards the united states where the africans were brought to trial under murder,positive
in the court various factions claim ownership of the slaves and therefore try to seize them away,positive
the united states government led by president martin van buren nigel hawthorne and secretary of state secretary forsyth david paymer try to ship the africans to spain where an 11 year old isabella ii anna paquin wants them back,positive
the two spaniards who own la amistad want the slaves for themselves,positive
the american ship that found the slaves also wants them,positive
in the midst of this are two abolitionists stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman who want the slaves to be free,positive
they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey who tries to free them,positive
through various legal proceedings the case appears before the supreme court where it is argued by expresident john quincy adams anthony hopkins,positive
the film itself is a visual wonder,positive
spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark somber mood when appropriate and a visual setting when appropriate as well,positive
at times the film is very slow and very methodical,positive
however spielberg is not at his finest here because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag,positive
the film is in essence a courtroom drama one whose events are oversimplified,positive
the characterization is also weak displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin mcconaughey and especially morgan freemans abolitionist,positive
but spielbergs finest work in the film the opening scene a scene of cinques family and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america is altogether stunning,positive
it is this emotional force that carries the film,positive
mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans hopkins is sensational as the old adams freeman is outstanding when used spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents and the rest of the cast is stellar,positive
the movie however belongs to hounsou,positive
his emotional intensity is brilliant,positive
spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou and the films extraordinary power is simply captivating,positive
the film is flawed for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard,positive
but that doesnt matter,positive
the story is a gripping one and one of extreme importance,positive
kudos to spielberg for finding it finding the right men for the job and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque,positive
a good job all around,positive
near the end of frank capras holiday classic its a wonderful life george bailey jimmy stewart is feeling down,positive
he has devoted his life to others and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town bedford falls,positive
standing upon a bridge above stormy waters he looks down contemplating suicide,positive
he has potential he hasnt fulfilled yet he has done so much for others,positive
as a young chap his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls,positive
but times and ambitions change,positive
things happen and hes stuck,positive
his guardian angel is there and shows him that its,positive
a wonderful life,positive
in a whirlwind tour of the town george sees what life would be like without him,positive
he learns the moral lesson that to live is a gift,positive
his earthly problems are solved,positive
the climatic scene is a marvel,positive
frank capras film is a centenial classic watched and reexperienced by every generation,positive
wonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh maybe fresher then it did when it was first released,positive
many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly,positive
but this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with firstrate acting wit and suspense glorious music and terrific set peices,positive
the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence georges guardian angel,positive
they arent all that bad but they remain corny and a little out of place,positive
nevertheless this is one film that deserves its place in time cinema history and our hearts,positive
it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age,positive
here is one genuine masterpeice a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection,positive
this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny exciting moving and uplifting,positive
the film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey there isnt too much to it but capra and the gang various screenwriters composers actors plumet the material to its fullest potential,positive
the result is a film though not at first intended to be pigeonholed as a holiday film that will always be remembered celebrated and loved,positive
with the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott a sequel was inevitable,positive
in fact after watching the first film a sequel was wanted particularly by this reviewer,positive
handing over the directors chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous to this one pirahna ii a surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron a household name the alien series got a facelift of immense proportions,positive
instead of being a fiction film cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture,positive
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created,positive
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while and when it does audiences are usually unprepared for it,positive
i never saw this movie in theaters but i wish i could have,positive
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear,positive
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen,positive
with a science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original film,positive
in fact aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original,positive
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine as the case may be,positive
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character,positive
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about,positive
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because of weavers presence a woman is the only suitable hero,positive
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended,positive
lieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened,positive
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens but the company is doubtful,positive
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left,positive
despite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and wont call the families back,positive
however when the company loses contact with the colony ripleys story seems much more feasible,positive
one of the companys directors carter burke paul reiser wants to gather a team to travel to the planet,positive
this team includes a buff private vasquez jenette goldstein a questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and a loyal android bishop lance henriksen,positive
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony,positive
arriving on the planet the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoontype environment,positive
the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn,positive
ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become and she becomes newts surrogate mother,positive
ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose,positive
aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scotts version it also multiplies the number of aliens in general,positive
alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo,positive
aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens and as a result the chills are incredibly heightened,positive
then again this is james cameron the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 judgment day,positive
he is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something as terrifying as this film,positive
it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes and aliens has the motherload,positive
with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion,positive
i cant recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for a moment,positive
just when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it starts right back up again,positive
with a seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history,positive
this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen,positive
using flawless special effects the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety,positive
of course for a film of this genre to work properly the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see,positive
aliens is completely realistic even a decade after its initial release,positive
the special effects are wonderfully seamless with a terrifying alien to go with them,positive
one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music composed by cameronregular james horner,positive
horner has created a terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work,positive
not only that horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film or science fiction film ever and that includes 2001 a space odyssey which was mainly a compilation of wellknown composers,positive
in fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music,positive
the production design is incredible which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy,positive
dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from welllit locations,positive
normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer aliens uses lights to scare the viewer,positive
then of course is the cinematography which uses point of view shots along with video feeds in order to build suspense,positive
some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley,positive
surprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best,positive
sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hardedged persona,positive
weaver soars above the rest in this film but she is supposed to,positive
carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child developing a threedimensional character from her quiet attitude,positive
lance henriksen is terrific as bishop showing that androids dont always have to be flat characters,positive
jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role and steals several scenes of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isnt fighting,positive
michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film,positive
however biehn does a good job making it seem original again,positive
paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages to pull it off quite well however i still see him as paul on tvs mad about you,positive
a very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action film making it stand out from others,positive
aliens is rightfully rated r for violence gore language and terror,positive
aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre as alien was more of a film,positive
aliens pumps up the stakes and cameron directs it with professional quality,positive
cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen,positive
technically astonishing aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed,positive
aside from this you probably wont experience anything like aliens for quite a while,positive
i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one folks,positive
i loved the wedding singer,positive
but it gets worse,positive
if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence,positive
hell same paragraph as the wedding singer im bound to be lynched,positive
well lynch me then because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory with titanic as the only exception,positive
right away youre ready to discount my review arent you,positive
youre thinking that i cant possibly know what im talking about,positive
after all this is adam sandler right,positive
well theres more,positive
i actually got choked up and more than once,positive
yes the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes,positive
but before you shrug me off as an imbecile i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself,positive
the wedding singer is the story of robby hart sandler a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so,positive
but when his own wedding results in a noshow for the bride angela featherstone as linda robby begins to reexamine his life and wonder why true love doesnt exist for people like him,positive
in the process of performing at these receptions robby meets a waitress named julia played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore whose reputation is anything but this character,positive
julia too is engaged and when robby finds himself without a wife his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding seeing as how her fiance the miami vice loving glenn matthew glave doesnt seem all that interested,positive
as the time goes by we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding hes merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women,positive
its obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for,positive
this isnt sleepless in seattle but id actually compare it to that before id compare it to happy gilmore,positive
while the wedding singer maintains some of that postsnl cornball humor its sincerity and charm carry it a very very long way,positive
sandler is great in his role and yes if you allow it you can take him seriously,positive
barrymore seems perfect along side him and although the two more likely represent genx moronism and partygirl ditzism respectively the two go together like bread and butter as a mideighties couple,positive
one scene in particular where julia ponders the future in a mirror is so well done i was on the verge of tears,positive
unfortunately sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a nobrainer but its got so much surprise substance packed inside that im encouraging everyone to go see it,positive
in fact the entire theater applauded when the film ended and laughs were so consistent some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar,positive
the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth and for those of us that are old enough to remember it it was a bodacious trip back and done very well,positive
sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm or is it anticharm,positive
while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars,positive
its hilarious and its touching,positive
its got that great cheezy humor but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected,positive
this is one to see again and again,positive
is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998,positive
my magic 8ball predicts it is certain,positive
the last steve martin film i saw the spanish prisoner was a very different approach for the comic actor,positive
as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob a process from a clueless businessman martins character did it all for money,positive
in his most recent movie bowfinger martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry,positive
he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name that will make him more popular at the parties and most importantly that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door,positive
playing the title role martin is once again the good guy the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie,positive
this con man is very likeable for some reason even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner,positive
maybe the message is that in hollywood to win over the trust and friendship of others you have to be a little evil,positive
bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars,positive
martin who also wrote the screenplay is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best peter sellers in two different but equally hilarious roles one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy burger king employee brother,positive
the story follows aging and failing bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a baction movie called chubby rain,positive
in order to attract actors and crew members bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie,positive
the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it,positive
but this wont stop the aggressive bowfinger,positive
he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him,positive
he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage,positive
will bowfinger be able to make his film,positive
or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on,positive
bowfinger is a very cartoonlike movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line,positive
the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department,positive
this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about it is always funny to see producers making fun of themselves or coworkers especially in a playful movie such as this,positive
besides the very repetitive and superflous ending bowfinger is a joy to watch,positive
if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it,positive
if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures the movie is great fun,positive
the happy bastards quick movie review,positive
analyze this,positive
how does one do a comedy focused on the mob,positive
well a few years ago there was a sly little comedy called the freshman which had marlon brando doing a romp of a sendup of his famous don corleone character and recently the utterly stupid in a bad way movie mafia,positive
failed to really get the joke,positive
this time around however warner bros may have gotten it right with analyze this a movie that hits its targets more than it misses and,positive
for plenty of reasons,positive
the story goes like this,positive
a mobster robert deniro finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a neardeath following a driveby shooting,positive
its these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist billy crystal whos mostly reluctant to take the mobsters case for two reasons,positive
first of course hes a mobster but secondly hes trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife lisa kudrow and kid,positive
and of course he cant rest worth for a moment because the mobsters goons are always needing the shrink for something be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation,positive
fortunately the movie is played out for plenty of laughs,positive
director harold ramis who also helmed the comedy multiplicity which wasnt half bad keeps the tone peppy and light even if its sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments shootings cant always be taken for laughs you know,positive
deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas but with a bit of a lighter heart,positive
a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious,positive
crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniros character uplifting him from such bombs as fathers day and my giant,positive
kudrow is also a hoot as crystals wifetobe whos on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniros presence,positive
is the movie perfect,positive
not really thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri hes a comic actor too come on give him some more but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy,positive
kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show either,positive
line of the movie crystal when you said you needed family therapy this is not the family i had in mind,positive
zero effect gets its title from the main character daryl zero bill pullman although we dont understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film,positive
zero is a private investigator perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived at least hed like to think so,positive
however hes a socially inept being and eccentric in every possible way this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are,positive
zeros accomplice is steve arlo ben stiller a normal guy who does the business side of the job hes the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zeros greatness as an investigator,positive
the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zeros talents to soontobe client gregory stark ryan oneal,positive
it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about,positive
zero takes the case and the plot thickens,positive
his path leads to a young pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan kim dickens,positive
despite her luminous and seeminglyharmless presence she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark,positive
through his investigations zero learns why but not without developing feelings for gloria feelings that because of his reclusive behavior are new and confusing to him,positive
i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film,positive
i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators and every once in a while a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away actually no private eye film has ever reached chinatowns greatness,positive
zero effect which is jake kasdans first effort as is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts its an original funny and completely involving motion picture,positive
with so many cliches available to this genre i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them,positive
but he didnt just successfully avoid flaws he has created a great film here one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment,positive
take for starters the great cast of characters,positive
pullman is terrific as zero showing a comic flair that i really havent seen from him since spaceballs,positive
zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here the fact that hes an almost exaggeratedly twisted emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe,positive
pullmans performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance and the occasional voiceover as hes going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious,positive
ben stiller is also a very funny individual hes the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny,positive
ill shoot you he says to stark at one point,positive
i have a gun and everything,positive
his character is also welldrawn with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend angela featherstone who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job,positive
oneal also gives his character a bit of depth and kim dickens last seen and underused in mercury rising gets a chance to show us her talent here giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs,positive
i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film,positive
kasdans humor is of the best kind soft spoken and mostly dialoguedriven though there are some great visual jokes,positive
its the kind of humor thats funny even after youve seen it five or six times,positive
theres one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is an how that makes him such a great detective,positive
what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed or standing motionlessly with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face his eyes pointing to something off camera but obviously to nothing in particular,positive
i cant convey to you how funny this is but what makes it great film making is that it has a point scenes like this are frequent and they provide solid characterization of zero,positive
as a side note i dont consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy not to sound elitist i find things funny that many do not and vice versa,positive
there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it,positive
i have a feeling the humor here wont appeal to everyone but theres certainly enough story and character development to keep anyones interest,positive
jake kasdan son of lawrence kasdan is only 22 years old,positive
i found this out after seeing the film and i cant remember ever being so impressed with a film maker,positive
his direction is stylish without being pretentious and his writing is mature full and developed,positive
zero effect is the kind of film that ill buy for my collection smart original films like this are rare as it is but this one actually has a heart and a soul,positive
at the end of the film i was involved in the characters and i was satisfied with the outcome,positive
and with kasdans undeniable talent at such a young age all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future,positive
i was anxious to see this for a long time,positive
a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell and he wanted to prove that shes as hot as he thinks he is,positive
he proved it for me all right but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that,positive
scream treads on familar ground horror movie with as star neve campbell puts it some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who cant act whos always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door,positive
its very familar your typical horror film,positive
so why you may ask after watching it does it seem so new and original,positive
because it treats itself as if it hasnt been done before and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old familar tired stuff,positive
this raises another question how does it do this,positive
simple the characters,positive
theyre not your typical stupid horror film victims who dont know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette,positive
they are horror fans they know how stuff happens in a horror movie they know what to do and what not to do and that makes it scary and even funny at certain times,positive
you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker drew barrymore is making popcorn getting ready to watch a video and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that if she gets it wrong will get her and her boyfriend killed,positive
she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions she just cant answer his final question what door am i at,positive
and that gets her killed,positive
that scene works because in a normal horror film half the things that happen in that scene would never happen,positive
the plot is typical horror stuff sidney prescott an impressive neve campbell an attractive young high school student whos mother was killed a year ago tommorrow is being stalked by a killer whos previously murdered one of her classmates casey naturally and everybody in this small california town is a suspect including sidneys boyfriend billy loomis,positive
but as i said before these people know how horror movies work and thats what makes it so appealing,positive
that and the references to horror movies like when casey says the first nightmare on elm street was scary but the rest sucked,positive
which is obviously director wes craven who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others and when tatum sidneys friend mentions the director wes carpenter which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven but also director john carpenter,positive
the cast is well chosen neve campbell pulls off a good heroine and unlike most horror film heroines she can act drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film and david arquette is impressive,positive
also good and funny in his role is henry winkler the fonz as the school principal,positive
i took half a point off for the unnecessary albeit limited appearance by friends courteney cox as reporter gail edwards sidneys rival because she covered her mothers disappearance,positive
i hate that show i hate those actors,positive
theyre untalented overexposed and overpaid imho and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough but i suppose he isnt,positive
kadosh means sacred in hebrew,positive
amos gitais fictional work after spending most of his career doing documentaries is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage even though the marriage is a loving one,positive
the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israelis modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidics intolerable one as both groups are vying for control of the secular government,positive
gitai yom is a labor party leftist who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government it would sound the death knell of israel,positive
the emphasis of the film is on how the ultraorthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of gods law from only the males view,positive
that if they ever got control of the country their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are,positive
the story takes place in jerusalems jewish quarters called mea shearim where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life which is much different than the way most jews live in israel,positive
this is a controversial film in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones that the film is bound to anger most viewers no matter their belief,positive
it is a slowmoving meticulous film that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go,positive
the force of what is seen though filmed in an objective manner never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance,positive
the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they cant at present live in harmony with their own people and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace,positive
the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual where every prayer is made to the virtues of god,positive
he even thanks god that he didnt make him a woman,positive
his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom,positive
she looks at him with glistening eyes not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life and from seeing movies and tv,positive
meir is a talmudic scholar,positive
his father abu warda is a rabbi at the yeshiva,positive
he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child,positive
since the hasidim look upon a womans role in life being only to conceive children and cook and clean house for the man while the mans role is to spend his time in prayer therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage,positive
she receives an anonymous letter that states a woman without a child is no better than dead,positive
meirs response is that it is written like that in the talmud,positive
meirs father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah,positive
all the blame is placed on rivka who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren,positive
she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself as her rigid mother koenig dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel,positive
their religion doesnt permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor,positive
rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile but she cannot tell him that because of their religion,positive
so when meirs father chooses a younger woman for his son she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters,positive
rivkas spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life,positive
she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov,positive
but because of the way they were both raised she is still a virgin,positive
when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon something his sect is not allowed to do he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer,positive
he now works as a singer in a nightclub,positive
malkas mother is worried that her daughter wont get married so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef someone whom she doesnt love,positive
yossef is a very stern follower of the order he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a soundtruck with a bullhorn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies,positive
the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage it will make her happy but while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage,positive
the harshest scene in the film is on malkas wedding night,positive
yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs and without the least bit of affection only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies as he goes inside her and rams her hard thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love,positive
the sisters have choices like everyone else in life does,positive
but the choices are obliterated by ones beliefs circumstances and inward nature and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up,positive
for the sisters the choices are life or death ones,positive
gitai by closing in on the daily rituals tight living quarters and closeknit community has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life,positive
the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would and everything seems strange to her all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories as she has made her choice and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed,positive
almost a full decade before steven spielbergs saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both anti war and prosoldier john irvins hamburger hill proved it could,positive
lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stones platoon this excellent film was dismissed as too militaristic,positive
its hard to understand exactly whyunless irvin in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable and often naive reasons chose to show up for the vietnam debacle has refused to present us with the stone killer drugstoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what the polack the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn became to wwii movies,positive
hamburger hill based on a true story is not an easy film to watch,positive
there is a scene that will have graying antiwar activists squirming in their seats or moved to genuine tears,positive
and the climactic final assault on the hill in question is visually confusing,positive
gristly realities are presented in brief flashes as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered,positive
and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee veteran and newbie black soldier and white become almost indistinguishable from each other as they do in the chaos of actual combat,positive
the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b vance as docin a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as seaman jones in mctiernans red october,positive
if youve seen private ryan you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hillif only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielbergs vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach,positive
bill condons gods and monsters is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classics frankenstein and bride of frankenstein,positive
since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but i suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations,positive
whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him,positive
as the film tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in l a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home,positive
james whale we learn quickly was what many people refer to him as in the film a dirty old man,positive
in one of the opening scenes a young film enthusiast visits whales home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing,positive
because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off,positive
clayon agrees and doesnt really think much of this much to the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past,positive
certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis,positive
gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to as a motion picture director rather than a horror director,positive
and in one heartbreaking scene he attends a party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore,positive
it is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life,positive
as played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale comes off as a sad but dignified man and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true to himself,positive
he never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person,positive
through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it means so much more to whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life,positive
although boone is only in a deadend job as a gardener of peoples homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is goodlooking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen to him,positive
since whale lives with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor,positive
although an extremely fine and mature picture a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness,positive
it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is a little thin and the structuring of the onagainoffagain friendship at the films center is fairly predictable,positive
we know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds,positive
in lesser hands this setup might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this,positive
also a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again,positive
if the film was not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether,positive
gods and monsters is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who i sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone,positive
the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end,positive
walking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably,positive
it is a sad testament when a persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one elses business in the first place,positive
dimension films scream 2 s distributor has asked press to say extremely little if anything about the films twisty plot,positive
thats no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here but i will do my best to be vague now theres a first,positive
the first one was good but all the rest sucked said a cinematicallysavvy teen in last winters wes craven thriller scream her statement referring to the films of the nightmare on elm street series but really putting down franchise overkill in general,positive
the comment certainly carries clout for every truly great sequel there appears to be a couple of duds making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas,positive
but like it or not along comes scream 2 and believe it or not its a doozy a slick sinister madly subversive good time at the movies as intent on sending up hollywoods sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions,positive
scream 2 is definitely that rare movie thing a followup that can stand along side its original with pride,positive
its been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munchesque getups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro california,positive
those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives,positive
plucky heroine sidney prescott neve campbell is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college her pop culturewhiz pal randy meeks jamie kennedy has tagged along,positive
trash tabloid reporter gale weathers courteney cox has written a bestseller based on their ordeal the basis of which has been turned into a very bad movie called stab,positive
and dewey riley david arquette still suffering from wounds inflicted during scream has left his job as a police officer for a while,positive
life is tranquil,positive
at least for a while,positive
several sudden murders bring sidney randy gale and dewey together again but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings if these four people learned anything from the past its to trust no one,positive
thus the possible killer list includes said quartet as well as derek jerry oconnell sidneys new beau cici sara michelle gellar a chatty sorority gal joel duane martin gales cameraman whos not too thrilled with her bloodsoaked past hallie elise neal sidneys sassy roommate debbie laurie metcalf a local reporter who gives gale some nottoofriendly competition and mickey timothy olyphant randys good friend and fellow film student,positive
cotton weary liev schreiber the man sidney wrongly accused of her mothers murder in scream also shows up on campus but why,positive
like the first scream craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang,positive
this time its an extended sequence that finds an africanamerican couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending a sneak preview of stab making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat nonroles of blacks in slasher cinema,positive
before tragedy ensues at the screening the moviewithinamovie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments including a scene from stab which turns screams nowfamous drew barrymore prologue on its ear,positive
b hang up the phone and star69 his a,positive
pinkett yells at the screen,positive
its funny creepy stuff i dont think ill ever feel safe in a movie theater again that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road,positive
another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phoneassault of the killer on randy dewey and gale in broad daylight it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters,positive
there are other superb set pieces but explaining them risks ruining their effect,positive
there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count,positive
its something of a tradein the new characters are too large in number to be as fullydeveloped as the original scream gang but this movie packs in knowing performances especially by kennedy and cox and more death for your dollar,positive
it can be argued that while the original might outclass it by a tad scream 2 is both scarier and funnier,positive
it certainly doesnt skimp with shocks a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart i actually questioned craven and williamsons judgment here considering how much this person has added to these films,positive
sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab the two scenes were shown are deadon but for film fans there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like the usual suspects aliens and the empire strikes back,positive
still scream 2 does so many things right its petty to quibble,positive
its penchant for parody is irresistible discussions of the merits of film sequels and all,positive
the attractive solid cast is a definite bonus,positive
and the denouement while not as shocking as scream s is priceless the films final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in scream with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper,positive
all this and a scream 3 is in the works,positive
knowing the series tendency for selfreference perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice,positive
mentioning scream 2 ll help them in their argument,positive

barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks,positive
on the surface hes coming home for a high school reunion but since this is a movie you know that hes really looking for some major life decisions,positive
a fairly small film this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman rosie odonnell and a bunch of actors that youve seen before but cant quite place,positive
commendable jobs all around they seem like real people,positive
hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spiritdead father terminally goony brother and old high school chums,positive
all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis,positive
the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst,positive
he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him,positive
the problem is that she is only 13,positive
unconsummated no its not that type of movie their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it,positive
starcrossed lovers with no where to go,positive
so hutton is gaga over a barelyteen one of his buddies is twotiming his girlfriend with a married old flame anothers girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter and shes a vegetarian,positive
things are a mess,positive
enter uma thurman,positive
the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls,positive
her character is fun to watch,positive
even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her,positive
like the lone ranger before she leaves she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives,positive
the ending is a bit too pat,positive
everything is tied up with a neat little bow,positive
rosie odonnell is a standout in her limited screen time with her brash personality and tell it like it is pronouncements,positive
structured somewhat like a diner a few years later this feelgood story is a good time but ends a little too nice,positive
well ill admit when i first heard about this film which was before dantes peak i could just smell what twister had started,positive
so now it seems that were in a full fledged return to the 70s disaster film era,positive
with twister dantes peak volcano and soon flood and james camerons extremly expensive titanic,positive
ill say first off i enjoyed volcano much more than i did dantes peak,positive
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in,positive
ive been reading a lot about the movie being cheezy or hokey and really didnt see or think that once during the entire film,positive
i get bored easily and this film didnt bore me for a minute,positive
another thing and boy am i bitching today that bothers me is when critics and such go on about well thats not really possible,positive
you know what,positive
i couldnt give a bloody damn if its possible or not really i couldnt,positive
its a freaking movie and i dont want reality thrown in my face,positive
i want to be able to see the impossible the all might what if to many reviewers have seen one to many movies,positive
the special effects are the second star to this feature,positive
they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground,positive
they did an incredible job and come oscar time if they remember some notice better be thrown there way,positive
when i left the theater after seeing david lynchs lost highway i remarked to a fellow moviegoer i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears,positive
in his first feature film in five years lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture eraserhead on the weirdness scale,positive
you wont know what happened when its over though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses,positive
it is difficult to describe the plot of this film because it depends partly on how you interpret it,positive
i can however describe what we see on the screen l a jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman and his wife renee patricia arquette whom he clearly suspects of infidelity receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep,positive
they are naturally enough more than a little frightened and confused and it doesnt help matters any when mystery man robert blake approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving,positive
the next morning fred finds another videotape which to his and our surprise shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom,positive
he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty,positive
the perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways most notably his affair with alice wakefield arquette again a blonde who is otherwise renees spitting image and another encounter with the mystery man,positive
i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more but suffice it to say that lynch doesnt offer any neat wrap ups nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion the cinematic demons of lost highway are out in full force from beginning to end,positive
this description might make lost highway sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism but in fact while there are traces of lynchs weird sense of humor this film is anything but giddy most of the time,positive
on the contrary lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynchs previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther,positive
the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery rather the character is the mystery,positive
there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion distrust and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goingson here,positive
we the audience are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this probably freds in my opinion and what in that case the other characters and events are meant to represent,positive
all of this proceeds appropriately in lynchs typically slowpaced idiosyncratic style,positive
as is often the case lynch relies on sound imagery and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story and in lost highway it works perfectly,positive
there are scenes when the camera lingers on freds blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coils song to the siren can be heard faintly in the background nothing is technically happening in these scenes yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as if not more so than the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity,positive
lynchs direction and director of photography pete demings darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story,positive
well most of the time anyway i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewers attention because of its tieins to the original mystery,positive
the main characters in this reality dayton a wellmeaning but none too intelligent 24yearold a sleazy gangster who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character and his pornstar girlfriend the blond arquette are nothing you couldnt find in any of the two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements such as the strained awkward conversations between pete and his parents help to preserve the films spooky unnerving tone during this stretch,positive
lynchs typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery are also somewhat overdone here,positive
its not exactly exploitative like almost everything else in this film the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off,positive
that said these minor flaws dont prevent lost highway from attaining its place as one of the darkest most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years,positive
it is a oneway ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind and as such it is gripping intense and brilliantly effective,positive
upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be hellraiser meets the crow,positive
but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue describing the strangers and their reasons for contacting human beings i was hooked,positive
there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice,positive
i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character,positive
sutherland played the role as a true veteran,positive
upon the completion of his monologue the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography,positive
i would imagine for a film of this caliber that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most,positive
the film flowed beautifully,positive
as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the dark city a clever plot began to unravel to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in the usual suspects,positive
not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy,positive
but if youre not exactly the biggest scifi fan caveat emptor,positive
get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of 12 monkeys or the crow without the boredom or depression,positive
the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as 12 monkeys was however so be prepared and be sophisticated,positive
and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comicbookgonefeaturefilm fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of,positive
dark city simply puts spawn to shame,positive
in fact during the climax of the film i couldnt help but feel the strong presence of an akira esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie,positive
so my initial predictions were wrong,positive
this film is anything but the meloncholy of hellraiser parts one through five,positive
im never one to base a film entirly on special effects so know that when i give dark city,positive
its actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even tsk tsk special effects,positive
not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away,positive
the best film ive seen all year and easily one of the best ive ever seen,positive
how many of us would become strippers,positive
for those of us who wouldnt is it a moral reason or purely a lack of confidence,positive
thats probably not a fair question and for a lot of us it could very well be for neither of those reasons,positive
as you watch the full monty however you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions,positive
would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough,positive
in case you havent guessed the full monty is about stripping but striptease it aint,positive
its actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication,positive
it is the story of six outofwork outofshape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless but not without need,positive
what to do,positive
it hits our main character gaz robert carlyle as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis,positive
it seems that simple take it off and bring in the cash,positive
eventually gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance,positive
these include the overweight confidencelacking dave mark addy the uptight overlyofficious gerald tom wilkinson the once suicidal lomper steve huison and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition horse paul barber an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy and guy hugo speer a young wellendowed looker who compares himself to cary grant,positive
when the sextet is complete were given a hefty dose of physical comedy,positive
we watch the bumbling middleaged men choreograph pseudosexy dance numbers all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place,positive
as if there antiappeal wasnt enough they decide to boost interest in the group by promising the full monty on opening night which for us americans means baring it all,positive
and i mean all,positive
the movie actually ends on opening night a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add,positive
its sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater,positive
with the subject matter you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feelgood almost inspiring film but it surprisingly turns out that way,positive
the amount of light touching drama also comes as a nice surprise never feeling offbalance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film,positive
theres a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words and the ensemble cast couldnt be better,positive
each character is completely individual interesting funny and most importantly real,positive
the full monty is never offensive a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone couldve easily fallen prey to tastelessness,positive
its one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment perfect for a great night on the town or as a saturday night movie rental,positive
either way you see it it shouldnt let you down in the slightest,positive
and pun heavily intended when its all said and done youll be smiling from cheek to cheek,positive
its certainly more than just a monster story,positive
kenneth branagh cowriter of mary shelleys frankenstein,positive
kenneth branaghs new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankensteinfilms made throughout the years in almost every part of the world including the most controversial version of them all directed by james whale,positive
the dark and stormy nights the lightning bolts the charnel houses of spare body parts the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful,positive
but the center of the film quieter and more thoughtful contains the real story,positive
horrorfans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror,positive
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues morality philosophy and human elements of the story and not on old fashioned horror cliches,positive
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel,positive
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean,positive
the year is 1794,positive
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters,positive
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs,positive
as the ice closes around his ship a figure appears on the horizon,positive
its a man,positive
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew,positive
his name is victor frankenstein kenneth branagh and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown,positive
the myserious stranger begins his tale or more precisely his confession in geneva 1773,positive
he is remembering his childhood and youth,positive
laughter banquets and parties a happy life without troubles or concerns,positive
here victor lived with his father ian holm mother cherie lunghi his surrogate sister helena boham carter and his servants in happiness and harmony,positive
this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed,positive
like thunder from a quite sky his mother dies giving birth to his youngest brother,positive
shocked baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair victor already interested in science becomes obsessed with death,positive
standing on his mothers grave he says oh mother you,positive
did not have to die no one should ever die i,positive
will stop this i,positive
promiss,positive
after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished victor travels to ingolstadt in presuite of a medical career,positive
after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night creating life from death,positive
composing dead bodies frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man both physically and mentally,positive
with strong electrical impulses he managed to breeth life into his creation,positive
the result was ugliness,positive
realizing what he has done frankenstein tried to undo his work but it was to late,positive
the creature has escaped,positive
because of the epidemic frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home making plans for the wedding,positive
for a while everything is as it was before his mothers death,positive
but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously,positive
whales picture although powerful never managed to capture the total depth of the novel,positive
brannagh has more or less done that,positive
another thing is characters and actors,positive
branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast,positive
the greatest performances comes from de niro the monster that has been played by among others charles ogle karloff lon chaney bela lugosi glenn strange christopher lee fred gwynne as herman munster and now robert de niro,positive
alone hated and feared he is completely aware of his ugliness,positive
at first he is like a helpless abandoned child desperately reaching out for love,positive
later when he reads frankensteins journal and learns that he is composed of dead bodies his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge,positive
he is capable of killing without regret,positive
i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground and,positive
then i slowly crushed his neck and,positive
as i killed him i saw your face,positive
that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator,positive
and yet he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all,positive
rarely has a cinematic interpretation of the daemon approached the level of threedimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel,positive
another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein,positive
in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster god knows why with the power of an electrical storm,positive
almost no time was granted on his charecter who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel,positive
here branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene,positive
branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character,positive
on the outside he is strong ambitious and talented scientist but deep down he is unsecure fragile and vaulerble constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past,positive
helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankensteins surrogate sister who at the end becomes his wife for a little while before death drives them apart,positive
the rest of the cast playing secondary characters is solid and nothing less than convincing,positive
visually the film is stunning especially the makeup,positive
the spinning camera the constantly buildingup musical acore the art direction the production design the costumes are all magnificent from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests to the plagueriddled streets of ingolstadt mary shelleys frankenstein is a wonder to behold,positive
kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare all,positive
i once loved lies in a shallow grave by,positive
my hand,positive
and the film ends exacly as hamlet when the creature sets both his and his creators body on fire,positive
the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness,positive
and a terrifying last closeup on the creatures smiling face,positive
can a man create life then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him,positive
to whom are its actions then attributable the creature or the being who brought about its existence,positive
shelley did not answer these questions but she certainly posed them,positive
following her example branagh does the same,positive
his film is a tragic saga about playing god,positive
victor frankenstein is not an evil man,positive
he wanted to change the world to the better,positive
in this he represents everything science stands for acting without doubts never considering the consequences of his actions,positive
produced by francis ford coppola frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film dracula,positive
in comparison i can say that dracula has visuals that even frankenstein can not live up to,positive
but when it comes to story characters and casting frankenstein is stronger,positive
but stronger than both of them on every aspect is neil jordans interview with the vampire,positive
although the film is not perfect the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective these minor faults are easily forgivable as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating,positive
branagh has probably created one of the best if not the best adaptions of shellys classic novel,positive
no matter what you suspect this isnt your usual action thriller,positive
the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer,positive
its one of those movies that after everything is revealed rapidfire at the end you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light,positive
plot twists agogo are what you get here i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me,positive
keyser soze is a name youll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason,positive
its not only the name of the mysterious and possibly even mythical crime boss in the movie it also sums up the movie keyser soze in latin means an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer,positive
or maybe i shouldnt have bought a foreignlanguage dictionary from the same company that makes those 99cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets,positive
at the movies opening a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup including mcmanus stephen baldwin keaton gabriel byrne fenster benicio del toro buckney kevin pollack and verbal kevin spacey winner of the best supporting actor academy awardsymbol 153 f times new roman s 10 h for his performance in the movie,positive
verbal is sonamed because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing,positive
he also earns his name as the movies narrator spouting memorable lines like the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt exist although obviously he does exist what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri any actor with multiple zs in their name is okay in my book,positive
we see the story unfold as spacey retells it,positive
the five felons upon being released from the lineup get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars and stealing all the money and drugs in the car,positive
its a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze who sends a minion to them with an offer they cant refuse,positive
namely they have to destroy sozes main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship shooting a bunch of people burning all the drugs and stealing 91 million cash,positive
spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent cripple character to life and baldwin byrne palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast,positive
the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense keeping the viewer guessing until the very end and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion,positive
i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv,positive
a different mystery i guess which may turn into a murder mystery if that video ever comes on again,positive
james l brooks one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news returns to the big screen with this entertaining if slightly flawed comedy,positive
nicholson plays melvin udall probably the most horrible person ever on the screen,positive
hes racist homophobic and never has a good word to say to anyone,positive
so nobody talks to him except waitress carol conelly t v,positive
sitcom star hunt who was last seen in twister 1996,positive
naturally udall conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop kinnear who nicholson hates all hit it off in the end,positive
like good will hunting 1997 and titanic 1997 even though the outcome is completely obvious as good as it gets is an enjoyable funny and warm comedy,positive
nicholson is hilarious as melvin churning out insults with superb relish,positive
only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers,positive
hunt is also good as waitress carol and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson,positive
theres also thankfully a bit of chemistry between them,positive
kinnear as the gay neighbor seems to have a slightly underwritten role hes more of a plot convience than a character,positive
although his performance is good his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together,positive
in fact the scene stealer is simons dog who is funnier than nicholson,positive
but then again pets are always cute on screen,positive
providing solid support is cuba gooding jnr jerry maguire 1996 and yeardly smith who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons although gooding isnt as good as is character in maguire he is still fun,positive
he overacts a little but not so much as to be annoying,positive
smith is also good although she has a fairly small role,positive
even director lawrence kasdan body heat 1981 makes an appearance as a doctor,positive
but this is primarily nicholsons film and every scene hes in hes steals it,positive
hes character is so hateful though its amazing that anyone talks to him at all especially carol,positive
and this is the films main problem,positive
its totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin,positive
she doesnt fall in love with him naturally the film forces her to fall in love with him,positive
also melvins character seems to go too nice too quickly,positive
i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice loving person,positive
it would take a helluva long time much longer than this film would like to make out,positive
brooks direction is good though if a bit average but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience,positive
he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones he tends to pile on to much schmaltz but generally hes good,positive
theres also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer,positive
but generally as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie,positive
the movie is a bit overlong but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly,positive
overall as good as it gets is a fun movie even though it may be unbelivable and certainly worth seeing if just for jack nicholsons performance,positive
not quite as good as it gets pardon the bad joke but still good fun,positive
krippendorfs tribe is a formula comedy,positive
done poorly formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema,positive
however every now and then one emerges like krippendorfs tribe that actually works,positive
professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss the renowned anthropologist is in trouble,positive
his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea,positive
however he found nothing,positive
his wife has recently died and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael lidner,positive
tonight he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe,positive
rather than break the news and face the consequences of misusing his funds he invents a tribe the shelmikedmu named after his kids,positive
however one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu but his research becomes a popular phenomenon,positive
soon professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members,positive
his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an overeager colleague veronica micelli jenna elfman and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist ruth allen lily tomlin,positive
krippendorfs tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief,positive
no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes,positive
luckily as the film builds momentum that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by,positive
though theres some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies,positive
the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable and the comic timing required for some of the films latter scenes is superb,positive
richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe,positive
jenna elfmans position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times but she plays the part with extreme affability,positive
even the kids who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side are endearing and humorous,positive
yes the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor but it has the best excuse of all its funny,positive
it may not go down as an alltime classic but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy plenty of laughs,positive
losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing,positive
reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare,positive
while we all might feel the desire to blow someones head off with a shotgun when they dont seem to grasp our point of view actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid,positive
this isnt the case with sam baily john travoltas slightly askew averagejoe persona in mad city,positive
i dont think people listen to guys like me sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum,positive
just a few days ago sam was a guard at this same museum but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position sams apprehension resulted in a brash decision,positive
in an effort to get his exboss museum director mrs banks blythe danner to just listen he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage,positive
sams overall concern is valid enough if he loses his job his paycheck his benefits etc his wife and two children wont be provided for,positive
hes not a lunatic or a hottempered madman hes somewhat like a child panicky compulsive and running on emotion and his naive intentions arent helped any by the fact that banks wasnt overly compassionate with the let go,positive
overall hes just like you and me except that he has the capacity to view the line wed deem far enough as the starting mark of some crazy race,positive
meanwhile television reporter max brackett dustin hoffman is also on the scene,positive
covering a fluff story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggestbreaking news story he ever couldve hoped for,positive
having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting max is anxious to turn this into his and only his story,positive
max immediately bonds with sam,positive
max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone,positive
at first maxs intentions dont stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor but as he gets to know sam more personally he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him,positive
the media however is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill,positive
the accidental shooting of exco worker cliff bill nunn a black security guard becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sams honest ambitions,positive
also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts head of the news department of the station max falls directly under and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander who uses his network power to try and outshine max,positive
alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities,positive
then there is mia kirshner who plays the young tv station intern laurie,positive
she falls under maxs wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting,positive
kirshners credits are relatively small for now including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow,positive
still kirshners character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kindabitchyinareservedway roles,positive
i wouldnt mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen,positive
while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy selfrighteous monster has indeed been tackled before mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability,positive
hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors and seeing them together is a real treat,positive
they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both,positive
there is quite a bit of humor in this film and without it it couldve fallen into a drab cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause,positive
this isnt a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart but it will lightly touch both making for a recommendable movie,positive
if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time i urge you to check this one out,positive
jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled kevin smiths greatest hits for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smiths earlier works including clerks mall rats,positive
chasing amy and dogma,positive
so be advised bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smiths latest outing,positive
kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature most notably miramax the studio whose subsidiary dimension films is jay and silent bobs distributor,positive
others deserving accolades include ben affleck matt damon directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas,positive
this is a laughfilled foulmouthed road film with jay jason mewes and silent bob smith hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramaxs production of bluntman and chronic comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers,positive
jays convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing but rather their comic book counterparts,positive
no matter the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country,positive
but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker played by george carlin who tells them to follow the book the rules of the road,positive
of course jays interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun carrie fisher who offers them a ride,positive
jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movies weaker aspects which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell can be easily tolerated,positive
really how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van and jay has a potinduced hallucination concerning velma and daphne,positive
the movies highlight though is near the finale,positive
in hollywood jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleckdamon picture good will hunting 2 hunting season,positive
here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each others careers and film choices,positive
and the laughs continue to grow,positive
next up is jason american pie biggs and james dawsons creek van der beek the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic,positive
the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles,positive
finally comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature,positive
this bit will leave you howling,positive
smiths obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers,positive
he allows them to play it all tongueincheek,positive
their fun comes through the screen to the audience,positive
it is too bad that this is jay and silent bobs swan song,positive
the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks,positive
but smith realizes that times have changed and he doesnt want his creations to overstay their welcome,positive
so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit saving the best for last,positive
goodbye jay and silent bob,positive
at least youre going out with a blast,positive
felix sami bouajila the siege lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel pierreloup rajot in the little town of dieppe in northern france,positive
when he is laid off from his job after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born he decides to journey to marseilles in the south to find the man he never met in the adventures of felix,positive
olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy jeanne and the perfect guy embracing that typically american genre,positive
their second effort the adventures of felix once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself,positive
felix is happy with his life in dieppe but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel he is out of a job and at loose ends,positive
when he goes through his late mothers papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles hundreds of miles away,positive
felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south puts together a supply of cocktails for his hiv virus kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot,positive
he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny,positive
along the way a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations,positive
on the road he witnesses a racerelated mugging that turns into murder and frightened for his own safety runs away without telling the police,positive
following this harrowing experience he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family,positive
his journey brings him to rouen and the films first title section my little brother where he meets jules a young art student who becomes smitten with felix,positive
they steal a car and develop a chaste brotherly affection before felix must move on,positive
he next meets elderly mathilde patachou in the chapter titled my grandmother and soon learns that she too has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to,positive
she wants him to stay with her but he must continue on his way to find his father,positive
in the weakest chapter of felixs road trip titled my cousin he meets a railroad worker philippe garziano and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off once again toward marseilles,positive
he next helps a stranded lady motorist isabelle ariane ascaride and shags a ride with her and her three kids each with a different daddy in the sequence titled my sister,positive
he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would,positive
on the final leg of the journey titled my father he meets an older man a fisherman maurice benichou who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felixs kite just like a father and son,positive
the adventures of felix has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery,positive
first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix,positive
he is a likable guy fighting his hiv with his doses of cocktails and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk often with dance and song to find his father and himself,positive
as he encounters each member of his new family promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally,positive
bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen,positive
the cast of characters making up felixs newfound family are nearly as charming as the star each in their own way,positive
patachou especially is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix,positive
ariane ascaride along with her kids gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had,positive
only the cousin chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felixs family,positive
the adventures of felix does not reinvent the road movie but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young mans journey to find himself and to his surprise his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning,positive
it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirotdelpechs crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside,positive
i give it a b,positive
every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio with every indication that it will be a stinker and to everybodys surprise perhaps even the studio the film becomes a critical darling,positive
mtv films election a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is a current example,positive
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened,positive
the plot is deceptively simple,positive
george washington carver high school is having student elections,positive
tracy flick reese witherspoon is an overachiever with her hand raised at nearly every question way way high,positive
mr m matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul a popularbutslow jock to run,positive
and pauls nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well for personal reasons,positive
the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectations were so low going in the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be,positive
you cant help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have,positive
election a good film does not live up to its hype,positive
what makes election so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from rushmore released a few months earlier,positive
the similarities are staggering,positive
tracy flick election is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play,positive
max fischer rushmore is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play,positive
the most significant tension of election is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student,positive
the most significant tension of rushmore is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student,positive
tracy flick is from a single parent home which has contributed to her drive,positive
max fischer is from a single parent home which has contributed to his drive,positive
the male bumbling adult in election matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined,positive
he even gets a bee sting,positive
the male bumbling adult in rushmore bill murray pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined,positive
he gets several bee stings,positive
and so on,positive
what happened,positive
how is it that an individual screenplay rushmore and a novel election contain so many significant plot points and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studios from a genre the high school geeks revenge movie that hadnt been fully formed yet,positive
even so the strengths of election rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell as pauls antisocial sister tammy,positive
broderick here is playing the mr rooney role from ferris bueller and he seems to be having the most fun hes had since then,positive
witherspoon is a revelation,positive
its early in the year its a comedy and teenagers have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination,positive
and once campbells character gets going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then youre won over,positive
one thing thats been bothering me since ive seen it,positive
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film,positive
i suppose that coming from mtv films i should expect no less,positive
but the film starts off light and airy like a sitcom,positive
as the screws tighten and the tensions mount alexander payne decides to add elements that frankly distract from the story,positive
it is bad enough that mr m doesnt like tracys determination to win at all costs but did they have to throw in the relationship,positive
even so theres no logical reason why mr m has an affair when he does,positive
theres a lot to like in election but the plot similarities to rushmore and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sexdriven mark this as a disappointment,positive
youve got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal computerdriven decade,positive
two people whove never met confide in each other via email without revealing their true identities,positive
nora ephrons contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence,positive
ephron who cowrote the film with her sister delia as well as directed it knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the atodds couple,positive
ryan is kathleen kelly owner of a small childrens bookstore while hanks is joe fox who heads up a chain of mega bookstores think barnes noble,positive
their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film even through some of the scripts rough spots,positive
for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast including parker posey greg kinnear jean stapleton and steve zahn,positive
yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan,positive
and the two are kept busy,positive
one the other or both are in nearly every scene,positive
hanks has his decent guy routine down pat yet each time he does it it seems effortless spontaneous and fresh,positive
ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew,positive
their scenes together sparkle even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle,positive
and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over youve got mail like driedup mistletoe,positive
the sparks created by the earlier movie are by necessity not evident here,positive
true these are two people seeking true love but youve got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor,positive
the ephrons script is witty and sharp,positive
however as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven,positive
some scenes drag while others especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via email are crisp and tidy,positive
also the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story,positive
a nice romantic soundtrack adds to this datenight special,positive
overall youve got mail is a lush and cute outing taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads,positive
its a nice holiday movie one for holding hands and snuggling,positive
committed to lifelong learning through effective communication,positive
no it is not a bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly,positive
event horizon is not your runofthemill scifi film im sure many who have watched this will agree with me,positive
it is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner,positive
the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical buildup that makes it wonderfully horrifying,positive
the story brings us to the year 2050 where space travel have since enormously progressed,positive
the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a mans lifetime,positive
the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune,positive
a search and rescue team led by miller fishburne is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon,positive
the designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship,positive
event horizon is a scifi horror film much truer to the word than say alien would ever be,positive
while in alien the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying,positive
the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud enough,positive
i cant stand this anymore,positive
there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime,positive
the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average by most commercial standards,positive
even so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film thanks to its wellpaced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences which incidentally has been quite generously removed by our censorship board,positive
director paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term horror,positive
this picture did not do very well in the us boxoffice most probably for the dreadfactor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this,positive
although on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for massentertainment many thrills spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus,positive
however the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing,positive
my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the experience of event horizon,positive
i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us,positive
be forewarned this film is not for the fainthearted nor for pure entertainment,positive
be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film,positive
event horizon is highly recommended but at your own risk,positive
it has been a long time since goodhorror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one,positive
we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist,positive
years later we see his subsequent resurfacing in the mid 80s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world,positive
the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown,positive
based on the life story of david helfgott this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a childgenius compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father,positive
in the 1950s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy,positive
the film traces his relationship with his father whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys,positive
david is offered places in the usa but his father refuses to let him leave australia,positive
the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teachers house,positive
he is well lit via the external house lights,positive
his teacher isnt home,positive
we pull back and see that the dark front rooms window has its curtains open,positive
there in a pool of blackness is a grand piano,positive
davids fall over the dark cliff has begun,positive
instead of being told in a linear mode shine jumps around in time ala pulp fiction,positive
this narrative device works well we see david as a boy teenager in london and mentalpatient in various snippets,positive
the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion,positive
adulthelfgotts return to the light is told in linear fashion,positive
the lead role is played by 3 different actors with the teenagedavid taylor and adultdavid rush standing out,positive
whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia i think this is his first major cinema work,positive
his david whilst clearly damaged he keeps quoting his daddy in a babbling word torrent cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts is both touching and funny,positive
taylors teenagedavid is the more sympathy producing role,positive
we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building,positive
his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninovs 3rd whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart,positive
technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production,positive
i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects,positive
one scene has adulthelfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain,positive
the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice,positive
with a clever subtlety the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping but of the same beat,positive
the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd,positive
but its us being clapped,positive
we are youngdavid walking up to the stage for our first public show,positive
the music as you would expect from a film of this subject matter is critical,positive
and it works very well,positive
the miming of the actors piano playing is faultless apparently rush didnt mime he really did play,positive
helfgotts life is certainly not without its sympathetic people,positive
indeed his return to the normal world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women,positive
his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft,positive
it shows that with the help of god we can all find our way back home,positive
whew this film oozes energy the kind of breakneck no holdsbarred inyourface risktaking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days,positive
like the marginal motley bunch of postapocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control,positive
the result a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message,positive
the message a bunch of losers with loser names mark renton ewan mcgregor spud ewan bremner sick boy jonny lee miller tommy kevin mckidd and begbie robert carlyle,positive
bored aimless and restless their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub grooving to techno or glamrock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods some ingenious others plainly dumb and desperate,positive
not part of the daily dose if obtained sex is a bonus,positive
you can find these characters as they are foulmouthed dirty pathetic ugly perhaps but definitely interesting in irvin welshs cult novel of the same name,positive
what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message,positive
one of the first things youll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly,positive
itll truck into a characters pimple just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot,positive
distracted and curious itll maintain a characters eyelevel or drop right to the ground to show the dopedouteyeview,positive
youll even find characters peering into the camera their faces smeared across the wideangle lens,positive
this film camera is just another one of the guys,positive
tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across,positive
bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares,positive
i dont want to give too much away but if you cross chuckie from childs play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures you might have an idea just how fun or pantswetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be,positive
that said this film has a good share of drugs consumed vomitted defecated pissed off exchanged bought sold injected smuggled enjoyed and regretted,positive
if that isnt your cup of tea nobody forced you to see the film,positive
stay at home and rent up close and personal,positive
and whats a buzz without tunes,positive
from pulp to iggy pop yes hes still alive the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film,positive
good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message,positive
every once in a while a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict,positive
trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations,positive
dom is a parttime filmmaker who graduated from northwestern universitys film programme not too long ago,positive
he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago,positive
nowhere town a 26min short film that he shot codirected and coproduced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production,positive
he is currently finishing a couple of small projects,positive
with his minute amounts of leisure time dom does nell impersonations,positive
its not good to know too much about someone charlie charles warns his niece charlie margaret welsh with a devilish grin,positive
charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle her soul mate as she calls him since her mother gave her his name,positive
theres a lot to know about charles not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east,positive
mark harmon who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them plays charles the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film shadow of a doubt,positive
and to avoid any questions about his guilt we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim,positive
the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma california where charles heads to avoid the police,positive
john gays script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson alma reville and thornton wilder,positive
karen arthurs direction is certainly no match for the great master but on an absolute scale the movie maintains a high level of suspense,positive
when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma they dont know about his nefarious activities,positive
he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway,positive
two mysterious and exceedingly cleancut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the average american family but their interest is focused on uncle charles especially on taking his picture and learning about his background,positive
charlie who first welcomed her uncles visit begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters,positive
the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers,positive
the beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other,positive
she wants him to leave and he doesnt want to go what with a local rich widow as a prospective victim,positive
will charles kill charlie first or will she get him out of town,positive
harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug and welsh is tough but trapped,positive
with a deft touch the director sets up each scene several with thunderstorms and tom neuwirths sepiatoned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s,positive
my only quibble is the directors awkward staging of the final scene on the train,positive
is hitchcocks version better,positive
of course,positive
is this one worth watching as well,positive
actually yes,positive
shadow of a doubt runs 1 40,positive
it is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up,positive
theres good news and bad news about mulan,positive
the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavyhandedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules,positive
on the other hand the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast,positive
but mulan is a step in the right direction and disneys best animated feature since the lion king,positive
after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians,positive
mulan is set in feudal china and features the everpopular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married,positive
thats what we find out when young mulan voice of ming na wen screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her,positive
cartoons,positive
meanwhile word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns,positive
since mulans a girl that means her decrepit old father must go,positive
she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family,positive
thats chinese culture for you,positive
so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her fathers uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place,positive
the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army,positive
it should have been called g i,positive
chang,positive
mulan calls on her ancestors for help,positive
they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up,positive
voiced by eddie murphy mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges,positive
murphys performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin lots of wisecracks and adlibs and even an introductory song about how much fun theyre going to have,positive
you aint never had a friend like mushu,positive
speaking of songs mulan doesnt have too many of them which is a plus with a story like this,positive
disney songs about war probably wouldnt go over too well heigh ho heigh ho its off to war i go and the ones they do have arent memorable,positive
the best of the bunch sad to say is be a man the requisite basic training montage song,positive
yes even in medieval china they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle,positive
sung by donnie osmond a bad sign if ever there was one be a man accompanies footage of mulans platoon going from screwups to heroes,positive
it makes me wonder has there ever been a musical montage in a movie thats ended badly,positive
i only wish reallife problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage,positive
for the curious mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl,positive
all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulderlength talk macho and slap guys on the butt as was male custom a thousand years ago in china,positive
the deception fools everyone but the audience who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12yearold boy at best,positive
but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army led by a big evileyed attillalooking monster,positive
as a villain the head of the huns is menacing evil and entirely forgettable,positive
i saw the movie yesterday and i dont remember the mans name,positive
otherwise mulan is a good movie,positive
the animation of the characters themselves isnt as rich as it could and should be but there are some amazing battlefield shots,positive
eddie murphy pulls off some good oneliners as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita the quintessential asian movie star,positive
hell george mr sulu takei does a voice in mulan,positive
you get the sense disney said to themselves alright lets get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood,positive
who can you think of,positive
well theres mr myagi,positive
good,positive
and mr sulu,positive
perfect,positive
weve got ourselves a movie now,positive
soon disney really will be able to paint with all the colors of the wind,positive
although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama the sopranos analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in its own right,positive
billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol who new patient happens to be gangster boss paul vitti de niro,positive
ben wants nothing to do with vitti as hes about to get married to laura macnamara kudrow and having a gangster as a patient wouldnt really help,positive
but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out,positive
all done in a comic fashion of course,positive
although never brilliant analyze this is also never rubbish which makes for a fun ride,positive
billy crystal who hasnt had a good role since city slickers way back in the early 90s is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act,positive
hes pretty funny while he does it and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers hes pretty funny,positive
robert de niro is hilarious as vitti playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny,positive
hes a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine,positive
lisa kudrow barely seen as crystals estranged wife to be basically reprises her phoebe role from t v series friends which is getting rather tiresome and doesnt come off well on the screen,positive
the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas and are all funny caricatures especially vittis bodyguard jelly joe viterelli,positive
the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie but with laughs instead of hard ass talking,positive
it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film but it strangely fits in,positive
spoofs are made of famous gangster movies including a nice parody of the godfather,positive
the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun,positive
theres also some odd plot points fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason,positive
it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script,positive
unfortunately this is hollywood so we will never know,positive
harold ramis best known as egon from ghostbusters has a deft touch with directing comedy as shown in the immortal groundhog day and the less immortal caddyshack,positive
all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience,positive
the script written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan starts off funny remains funny for the most of the film but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory,positive
the film is short however and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll,positive
analyze this is a good comedy and is certainly worth watching,positive
robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it even though it does seem forced or like a parody although i think this was intentional,positive
crystal is his most likeable in years kudrow is given as little screen time as possible which is a good thing and de niro is just awesome,positive
its no goodfellas and it probably wont be remembered as much as groundhog day but analyze this is a well done comedy that wont leave you feel cheated,positive
directed by pixote hunt hendel butoy eric goldberg james algar francis glebas gaetan paul brizzi conducted by james levine composed by ludwig van beethoven ottorino respighi george gershwin dmitri shostakovich camille saintsaens paul dukas sir edward elgar igor stravinsky rated g scripture references 1 samuel 16 23 ephesians 5 19 1 chronicles 15 1516,positive
in 1940 walt disney released a filmed experiment,positive
fantasia was a blend of two art forms classical music and animation,positive
while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day it has since become recognized as something of a classic,positive
according to the program notes it was mr disneys intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress,positive
sixty years later thanks to the ongoing efforts of walts nephew a new fantasia is being released,positive
it was not only worth the waiting it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past halfdecade,positive
with seven new sequences and one old favorite fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films,positive
like the original fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studios primary audience,positive
ranging from the silly to the sublime each segment is preceded by a short humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host steve martin bowfinger being the first and most effective,positive
these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators is thoughtfully and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis,positive
fantasia 2000 is being released exclusively in the giantscreened imax theaters making for a unique viewing experience,positive
there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone and surely people will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites,positive
for me that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected and discontented people living in nyc who unknowingly help each other realize their dreams,positive
drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld and inspired by george gershwins rhapsody in blue the music and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts,positive
children will like the short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saintsaens,positive
here a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yoyo playing antics,positive
they will also giggle as donald duck playing noahs assistant tries to load the animals into the ark to the familiar strains of pomp and circumstance by sir edward elgar,positive
while the depiction is not biblically accurate it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7,positive
a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended,positive
there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighis pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of natures cycle of life death and rebirth in igor stravinskys firebird suite,positive
but the stories they tell are uplifting containing nothing too frightening for our younger children,positive
the darkest segment spiritually speaking actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia mickey mouse in the sorcerers apprentice by paul dukas,positive
but overall the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones being full of hope and promise,positive
music has an impact which can be undeniably felt capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums,positive
it is no wonder that the levites as the priestly tribe of the old testament were also the appointed musicians,positive
if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts it will have done an incredible service,positive
while watching boiler room i was constantly reminded of last years masterpiece fight club,positive
both films consist of a predominately male cast,positive
both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires,positive
and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped,positive
while boiler room ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation,positive
a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire,positive
paying homage to oliver stones 1987 classic wall street younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older more experienced types,positive
as is true in real life younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology,positive
boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages,positive
another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks,positive
some people are convinced that an allmale cast automatically means there must be gory violence here is proof that this is not true,positive
if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck go see reindeer games this weekend,positive
if you want to see a smart insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script see boiler room,positive
giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the films narrator seth,positive
after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man nicky katt,positive
he agrees to take the job in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years of selling stock to welloff americans from the midwest over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his coworkers,positive
learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production seth figures this is too good to be true,positive
after stumbling into a room at the wrong time he knows there is something no good about this company,positive
at this point seth is left with the ultimate choice continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on,positive
ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin playing seths dad,positive
the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves,positive
the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film,positive
the supporting cast of greedy coworkers is also flawless,positive
ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt,positive
the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring,positive
the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens,positive
there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable,positive
due to the lack of a major event boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into,positive
the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller the romantic segments involving seth and abby nia long are not properly finalized and the dialogue isnt funny enough to make it a comedy,positive
in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole boiler room is slightly confused at times,positive
it doesnt seem to know which category to fit itself into,positive
one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better,positive
otherwise the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors,positive
some critics including siskel ebert are on the record stating that martin scorseses raging bull the story of boxer jake la motta is the best film of the 80s,positive
since there are still a number of 80s films that i havent seen i dont feel qualified to make such a judgment but ill say this without hesitation raging bull is a great motion picture and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 1980 and december 31 1989 come close to its level,positive
biopics often fall into one of two categories overblown hero worship or a dry dull textbook account,positive
its rare that a movie with the moniker based on the life of comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining,positive
raging bull is the perfect counterexample and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre,positive
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta a middleweight icon from the 40s and 50s and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen,positive
for all 129 minutes director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro in the title role have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic sad and horrifying,positive
historically raging bull is said to be mostly accurately with the lions share of the details culled from la mottas own autobiography which was cowritten with joseph carter and peter savage,positive
however although la motta is credited as the movies consultant he was reportedly unhappy with the final result because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth insensitive lout,positive
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base bestial impulses paranoia jealousy and blind rage,positive
sex and violence are inextricably linked,positive
the title is apt la motta is a raging bull,positive
in the ring he is a terror not just beating his opponents but destroying them,positive
outside of it he is no less vicious or more easily controlled,positive
the two people who spar with him on lifes canvas are his wife vicki cathy moriarty and his joey joe pesci,positive
these are the two who mean the most to jake and who as a result of his inability to trust himself or others he loses,positive
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity and when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him his lets loose with an explosion of violence,positive
raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta an upandcoming fighter is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class,positive
over the years he wins several key bouts including one against his archrival sugar ray robinson johnny barnes but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match,positive
meanwhile away from the ring la motta falls in love with 15year old vicki who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife,positive
vicki becomes jakes greatest prize a wife in his view is not a companion but a possession and the source of his most extreme pain,positive
his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him,positive
hence he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else perhaps even his brother,positive
this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere are you f king my wife,positive
in the late 40s la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight but with one huge condition he must take a fall,positive
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing,positive
two years later he wins the championship only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray,positive
by the late 50s and early 60s when the film ends jake has become a pathetic figure a broke overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor has lost his wife and children and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine,positive
raging bull is the other side of rocky,positive
sylvester stallones tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976,positive
it won the 1977 best picture oscar and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production,positive
but where rocky romanticizes boxing raging bull takes a cold unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring,positive
while scorseses primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man he never backs away from showing the seedy ugly underside of a sport where gambling greed and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working,positive
rocky shows boxing at its noblest raging bull shows it at its most diseased,positive
theres little i can say here that hasnt already said about de niros performance,positive
in a career that has included many fine roles this is his most outstanding,positive
the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering,positive
and although theres a lot of travis bickle de niros character in taxi driver in la motta scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that if we never fully sympathize with him at least we understand the forces that drive him,positive
this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting,positive
as the younger jake de niro is trim and fit,positive
as the fat older man de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form,positive
how many actors would go that far,positive
the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance,positive
cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work although neither won,positive
their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niros,positive
pesci who has basically recreated the same personality in two other scorsese films goodfellas and casino presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother,positive
the misogyny and violence are still there only better concealed,positive
but when joey snaps as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster frank vincent its startling to behold,positive
moriarty on the other hand must play the temptress with virginal qualities the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake,positive
later shes called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear,positive
scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in blackandwhite a few home movie segments are in color,positive
the choice is perfect for the movie giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a blackandwhite approach is almost unheard of,positive
one important recent exception schindlers list eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did,positive
in blackandwhite especially considering scorseses choice of shots and use of slow motion the violence is stark and disturbing,positive
theres no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas,positive
during fight sequences the director also uses a number of pointofview shots designed to show the world however briefly from la mottas perspective,positive
scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la mottas loss to sugar ray where he surrendered his middleweight crown,positive
after that his career was all downhill,positive
yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment stretching more than a decade into la mottas future,positive
the reason is obvious scorsese isnt as interested in boxing as he is in the character,positive
following his retirement la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies,positive
we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self,positive
who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brandos speech from on the waterfront,positive
i coulda been a contenda,positive
perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the 80s,positive
and if not its certainly perilously close to the zenith,positive
it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy made their feature film debut with blood simple a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge murder and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas,positive
it bears some resemblance storywise to the coens recent fargo but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here blood simple is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end,positive
the premise of blood simple is really just a slight variation on the standard love scheme sleazy bar owner julian marty dan hedaya hires a shifty private detective m,positive
emmet walsh to kill his wife abby frances mcdormand and her illicit lover ray john getz,positive
things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but upon collecting the money becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme,positive
to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much but what ensues is a series of bloody and i do mean bloody confrontations each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening,positive
every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrators eyes but we the audience are made privy to the big picture and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person,positive
this aspect of the story along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality one gets the sense that if guns and in one case shovels were not available some of these characters would claw each other to death are the most effective components of the film,positive
the coens might have done well to title the film fear and loathing in texas,positive
some have labeled blood simple as a modernday noir but while i am not an expert on either genre it seems more like a horror movie than anything else,positive
the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one relatively innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive,positive
that said blood simple is a very good horror movie the fear and suspense here are genuine,positive
the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun discharging it as it skitters across the floor or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film,positive
that said blood simple is not exactly flawless,positive
for one thing the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover or at least thought they did but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder,positive
and although they at least didn t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife the coens also arent quite immune to horror cliches they indulge in a prolonged deadguyseemstohavecomebacktolifebutthenwefindoutitsonlyadream scene that had me rolling my eyes,positive
the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film,positive
blood simple is not quite the masterpiece of neonoir that many seem to think it is but its a decent movie and it showcases the coens ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but nonexploitative manner,positive
i would firmly recommend it to all coenheads as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller,positive
when will the devil take me he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over,positive
the spoiled title character of onegin pronounced ohneggin is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour,positive
martha fiennes debut feature is quite literally filmed poetry its based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin a profound study of regret of how we confuse shame with guilt,positive
when we first meet eugene onegin ralph acting for his sister another brother magnus composed the score a philandering aristocrat from st petersburg he has just inherited his uncles estate,positive
with plans to sell it onegin pays a summer visit to the manor which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods,positive
smitten with olga larina headey he befriends olgas fianc vladimir lensky stephens while olgas sister tatyana tyler romanticizing his flippant attitude hes a nineteenth bad boy falls for onegin,positive
in one sweaty inky torrent of passion tatyana writes him a love letter,positive
he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections it is implied because he can,positive
soon after tragedy strikes and onegin makes himself scarce,positive
when we catch up with him six years later he has just returned to st petersburg where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend donovan has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana,positive
this time onegin finds her irresistable,positive
what is most amazing about ralph fiennes performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch,positive
overwhelmed by a top hat the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past,positive
the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long nowtheres room to breathe in a role thats made up of shades of gray like onegin,positive
petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in parking lot you dont know what youve got til its gone,positive
onegins aboutface on tatyana speaks for those of us read most of us who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well,positive
what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse embarrassment even at having let her go,positive
out of identification we feel empathy for onegin a callous bastard,positive
tatyanas emotions echo a thousand ditties but that makes them no less vital,positive
she changes too from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties,positive
tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk costars filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares,positive
they both have faces mr fiennes and ms tyler capable of conveying archetypal russian misery,positive
onegin could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of masterpiece theater even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact were martha fiennes not at the helm,positive
an mtv background she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others has positively influenced her sense of pace though thankfully not her shot lengthsno spasmodic cutting here at just over 100 minutes onegin clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair,positive
the film has an atypical period look as well,positive
absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions,positive
the sets are almost expressionistically bare echoing the loneliness of the protagonists,positive
cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them im reminded the climax which unfolds in a sea of white,positive
martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema and her spare often painfully human visual presentation of yevgeny onegin is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkins difficult text yet,positive
ms fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion,positive
with storytelling this compelling who needs books,positive
based on the book by author james ellroy l a confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years,positive
together with director curtis hanson the hand that rocks the cradle the river wild whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight an atom would have to squeeze itself through,positive
set in the 50s the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities,positive
jack vincennes spacey is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention,positive
there is also the young hotshot rookie ed exley pearce fresh out of the academy and allout to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father,positive
the tough and unnerving bud white crowe a cop who believes in justice the swift and violent way,positive
3 policemen distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil,positive
when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder,positive
even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case happenings began to link itself to the murder,positive
the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organisedcrime in hollywood,positive
the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects,positive
in l a confidential you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of story going for it,positive
there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all,positive
surprisingly though spacey did a very convincing job as the streetwise vincennes the movie was carried mostly by the two rather unknowns pearce and crowe,positive
pearces exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance,positive
crowes bud white is the most impressive of all headstrong and temperamental he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here,positive
superb acting wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever,positive
easily the best hollywood piece for 1997,positive
your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people who hop in and out of bed with each other,positive
written and directed by neil labute whos first film in the company of men was simply marvelous disappoints a bit here with this one,positive
the story involves two couples ben stiller catherine keener and aaron eckhart amy brenneman an artist assistant nastassja kinski and an egotistical women abuser jason patric,positive
the characters names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie,positive
each of the characters has their own sexual style and they dont seem to merge together well,positive
so the group experiments behind their respective partners back,positive
there are some hysterical scenes one involves jason patric aaron eckhart and ben stillers characters,positive
they are all in a sauna talking about their best lay when jason patrics character makes a surprising confession,positive
the whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted,positive
the enjoyed this movie although it seemed a tad lengthy even though it only runs 99 min,positive
the films cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener aaron eckhart and jason patric,positive
i would not recommend this film to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit,positive
it did seem to offend people more than half of the people in the theater left during the film,positive
although your friends and neighbors doesnt have the power of labutes earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relationships,positive
it must be tough to be a mob boss,positive
just ask paul vitti robert deniro a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing,positive
i can believe it too one cant even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when hes forced to choose between an ice pick baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with,positive
suffering from reoccurring panic attacks paul decides he needs to consult some professional help,positive
and who better than billy crystal,positive
after appearing in bottomofthebarrel flops fathers day and my giant crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here,positive
playing vittis private shrink the two very different stars strike an unorthodox but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish,positive
casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an injoke i think,positive
placed in this mobsters shoes deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather part ii and casino,positive
its obvious hes having a lot of fun doing so,positive
the man behind the camera is harold ramis whose credits include ghostbusters as writer and star and his best directing effort the bill murray vehicle groundhog day,positive
ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows whats funny and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors,positive
the only character who weakens the payoff is crystals bridetobe lisa kudrow,positive
playing the same dumbeddown role as she does in friends kudrow is amusing but doesnt fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped,positive
the supporting cast sparkles,positive
joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly vittis pea brained righthand man and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster whos in desperate need of the definition of closure,positive
the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides,positive
the situation is just too cute to resist,positive
its unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand,positive
but hey if youre in the mafia using obscenities probably comes naturally,positive
and near the end seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat,positive
scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well,positive
during a filmclass discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up to the originals,positive
a few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one,positive
scream 2,positive
1996s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america,positive
a sequel was unavoidable but luckily the reteaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment,positive
in fact at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film,positive
sidney prescott neve campbell the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro ca in the original scream is now two years older and off to college majoring in theater,positive
meanwhile tv journalist gale weathers courtney cox who covered the murders in the first film has since written a book about the dreadful events a book titled stab which has been developed into a major motion picture,positive
as scream 2 opens a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of stab and before long a young couple are butchered to death unnoticed in the midst of hysteria,positive
this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown copycat sets out to repeat whats been done,positive
and finish what hasnt,positive
of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film and yes movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds but this is a sequel and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies,positive
this is in large part due to williamsons deliciously written script which will easily leave you satisfied,positive
as much as the film condemns the use of cliches it is riddled with them but it is done so effectively and with skillful direction by craven that youre not bound to complain,positive
i will note however that the whodunit,positive
did wind up being the first person i suspected but believe me i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie,positive
all the actors outdo themselves here,positive
were not talking oscar performances but cambell cox david arquette as dewey riley and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing,positive
the characters remain true to their roots and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years,positive
we can see how the events in the first film has affected them but we dont lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place,positive
the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesnt seem offkilter from its predecessor,positive
its a natural smooth and believable as far as horror films go transition from film to film,positive
we skip two years but there doesnt seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks,positive
it flows so well that you feel more like youre reading chapter two of a book long chapters eh,positive
than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces,positive
while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels scream 2s entire plot structure correlates completely with the first making for immediate fondness and absorption,positive
as i said before scream 2 easily lives up to if not surpassing its precursor,positive
the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first,positive
this doesnt mean that it overcasts the unique whimsical humor or overall caliber of its sequel it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked its own while maintaining its soughtafter qualities,positive
if ever a film followed its original so well it would be scream 2 and it makes this a definite mustsee for all those unbridled scream fans out there,positive
scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream and will hopefully receive as many high remarks,positive
it would top off the series quite well if it werent for the fact that two movies dont really make a series,positive
its unlikely to assume that a scream 3 wont appear in the next few years but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horrortrilogy lets hope they can keep up the fantastic work,positive
like they say dont mess with perfection,positive
but when a moneymaking smashhit is almost guaranteed whos gonna listen,positive
for more than a decade anjelica huston has been one of americas finest actresses,positive
in her directorial debut bastard out of carolina based upon dorothy allisons largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well,positive
the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth in postworld war ii south carolina,positive
through voiceover narration done by laura dern we find that she nearly didnt survive birth as her single mother anney played by jennifer jason leigh was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident,positive
thats just the beginning of her troubles,positive
bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come,positive
anney meets and weds lyle a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident,positive
anneys brother earle played by michael rooker introduces her to glen played by ron eldard a coworker at the mill,positive
glen the black sheep of a wealthy family when are you gonna make your daddy proud,positive
ill tell you when never,positive
hes told and filled with bitterness courts anney and eventually wins her despite warnings of a violent temper,positive
when anney miscarries with his muchprized baby boy glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone beating and abusing her while the lovedependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour,positive
things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment,positive
while set several decades ago this story remains completely relevant in todays society where abused wives return to their husbands and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other,positive
the real star of this domestic drama is not topbilled jennifer jason leigh but child actress jena malone who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance,positive
her work is of awardcalibre and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged kirsten dunst tina majorino anna paquin natalie portman christina ricci elijah wood malones performance stands up well,positive
leighs performance in bastard out of carolina is fine although shes not really given much to do and ron eldard work is very solid skillfully manouvering his characters moods in and out of explosive rage,positive
one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressurecooker ticking away,positive
of the supporting cast special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rookers performance,positive
theres a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms to the familiar sight of a driedup uptight wise old granny played by grace zabriskie sitting on the porch rocking chair to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance,positive
still it cannot be denied that anne merediths screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power,positive
hustons direction of the film is surehanded and impressive giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast particularly the young malone,positive
her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hardhitting emotional rather than graphic manner and are very effective,positive
hustons talent with camera positioning is wonderful from a visually striking shot done through a fan to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile,positive
the film has the toneddown feel of a television production bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience,positive
perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing,positive
contact pg theres a moment late in robert zemeckiss contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place,positive
we see a scientist dressed in a silvery space suit walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact spherical space pod unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops,positive
anticipation excitement anxiety fearthe audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character nervously breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead,positive
it is this sense of discovery the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical captivating entertainment,positive
jodie foster stars as dr ellie arroway a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals,positive
and i mean lifeafter losing her entire family when she was young the only thing occupying ellies world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth,positive
after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport,positive
from this synopsis contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the scifi hook,positive
the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe but perhaps more than anything else contact is a character study of ellie whose obsession with empirical scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power,positive
the irony is that while admitting to having no religious faith she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes in a sense a religion in its own right,positive
it would be easy for scripters james v hart and michael goldenberg in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones but they wisely eschew easy answers giving equal time to both sides and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane,positive
in the end there is no right or wrong nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other even slightly sothere are just two very viable points of view each with their own merits each with their own faults,positive
the complex role of ellie is an actresss dream and foster a virtual shooin for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year more than rises to the challenge,positive
she conveys intelligence determination warmth and in a gutsy move always on edge,positive
we root for ellie and feel for her but we also feel at times that she goes too far,positive
contact is clearly fosters vehicle but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles,positive
matthew mcconaughey who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss however his main storyline the tentative palmerellie romance is the films weakest subplot,positive
john hurt is effectively creepy as s r,positive
hadden the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding,positive
angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine,positive
most memorable of all though are tom skerritt and james woods who play rival scientist dr david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz respectively both especially skerritt embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances,positive
zemeckis comes off of his threeyear break in top shape,positive
always known as a director of effectsladen extravaganzas it comes as no surprise that contacts visual effects are quite stunning,positive
the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 a space odyssey but with more advanced technology at his disposal zemeckiss voyage is even trippier than stanley kubricks yet more wondrously pure,positive
and zemeckis doesnt resist the urge to use the alwaysinteresting incorporateactorsintoexistingfilmfootage effect which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump,positive
effects however are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama emotion and pure wonder which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump,positive
it says a lot that in a summer science fiction film such as this its not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised,positive
the thoughtprovoking twohourplus contact is a muchwelcome change of pace from summer nobrainers but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isnt entertaining,positive
for all the interesting questions it asks the film is still what its being sold as a journey to the heart of the universe,positive
and what a fascinating unforgettable journey it is,positive
its rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year but that is what disney and pixar animation s latest film represents,positive
while a bugs life isnt nearly as deep as its predecessor dreamworks antz it is just as funny,positive
a bugs life centers appropriately around the life of an ant named flik,positive
flik cutely voiced by newsradios david foley hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task,positive
when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way,positive
the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them,positive
the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey,positive
when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food,positive
when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission they never dream he will be successful they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food,positive
fliks mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return,positive
instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs who he mistakenly assumes are warriors,positive
when he returns with the warriors the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes,positive
a bugs life has animation that is simply stunning,positive
the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative,positive
together with the great voice acting this film is the perfect holiday family film,positive
its main weakness is that it couldnt beat antz to the theaters making it seem like stale material,positive
in one scene from the people vs,positive
larry flynt the hustler magazine publisher appears at a selfstaged free speech rally,positive
as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him flynt strides confidently across the stage delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity,positive
the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in patton where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag,positive
both scenes were stirring larger than life richly entertaining and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies,positive
overall that sums up the people vs,positive
larry flynt,positive
the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which despite being based on fact feels like a big phony hollywood movie,positive
the son of a kentucky moonshiner flynt woody harrelson ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati,positive
there he met althea leasure courtney love a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life,positive
to bolster interest in his clubs he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine,positive
flynt along with the magazines ragtag management team headed by his brother jimmy played nicely by woodys reallife brother steak shake commercial veteran brett harrelson viewed playboy magazine with contempt,positive
they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos striving to keep hustler focused on what guys really want explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm and extremely crude humor,positive
the films prime example of hustlers attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynts naughtiness,positive
director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazines frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation racism and endless scatological cartoons,positive
flynts rag labored in welldeserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis which brought the magazine international attention big money and the attention of conservatives,positive
an obscenity bust followed the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law,positive
lawyer alan isaacman edward norton enters the scene hired by flynts wife,positive
norton an exceptional actor is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynts increasingly childish and bizarre behavior,positive
in court we meet the sputtering conservatives headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating james cromwell,positive
as keating blathers about flynts immorality the camera slowly moves in for a closeup of his name tag inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating who was later convicted in a 2 billion sl fraud,positive
flynts other prime foe is rev jerry falwell who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse,positive
tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a wouldbe assassin leaving him paralyzed from the waist down,positive
a dark period follows as flynt and leasure hole up in an l a suite strung out on pain killers,positive
flynt eventually kicks drugs but leasure succumbs to addiction and later aids,positive
after watch falwell on tv describing aids as a punishment from god flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court leading to the films climactic courtroom scene,positive
the people vs larry flynt is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt,positive
if theyll protect a scumbag like me then theyll protect all of you declared flynt,positive
hes right of course but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons,positive
he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt,positive
harrelson is an attractive charismatic man and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero,positive
even a cursory look at the real flynt who is making the talk show circuit and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene shows a bloated morose and bitter man,positive
an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch but a richer one,positive
despite its flaws flynt is a fast moving rousing movie with some terrific acting especially by courtney love whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod,positive
the story may be candycoated but its still delicious candy,positive
titanic is so close to being the perfect movie its upsetting that it isnt,positive
the film which cost 200 million to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it sunk pun intended is a labour of love for cameron who wrote and directed the film,positive
we all know that big budget dosent mean great film see waterworld 1995 but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic,positive
but sadly titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece although it is one of camerons best films,positive
the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic,positive
they find a safe and inside a picture of a woman,positive
the woman in the picture an old winslet tells the explorers that the picture is of her,positive
the explorers invite her over and she then tells her story of titanic,positive
in the flashback dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson who after winning a poker game wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic leaving liverpool to go to america,positive
also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater winslet who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosent love at all cal hockley zane so her family can remain rich,positive
she nearly commits suicide on the ship but jack comes to the rescue saves rose they fall in love and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them,positive
oh yeah and the ship sinks,positive
and that is the main problem with the film and which stops it from being a work of genius,positive
the story and script both by cameron are both weak,positive
the story is full of cliched characters the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry the poor boy with heart the stuckup mother and poor dialogue the script consists of lots of injokes of how the boat wont sink and most of the dialogue is pretty basic its a shame really as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film,positive
without good dialogue a film could become a very long very boring film like camerons own terminator 2 1992 but luckily there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear,positive
firstly theres camerons direction,positive
there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic,positive
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end,positive
there is a lot of mayhem and panic all done very well by cameron,positive
its a scary sight watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below,positive
thanks to camerons direction then the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes,positive
to support the directing are the excellent cast working very well with their underwritten characters,positive
dicaprio is good although he only looks 1617 years old,positive
his performance of a over excitiable yet also well mannered boy is excellent and he also has some funny lines,positive
winslet is great also and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth,positive
zane is deliciously evil as cal saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash,positive
the audience really does come to hate him,positive
he may be playing the same character he plays in every film hes in like dead calm 1988 but he does it really really well,positive
also worthy of note is kathy bates edward scissorhands 1990 as a loud mouthed american,positive
finally the icing on the great things cake are the special effects,positive
cameron is a whiz with effects just watch aliens 1988 terminator 2 and true lies 1994 and they are used very well throughout,positive
the sweeps of the ships are awesome although digital domain who did the effects cannot animate human movement too well,positive
the humans seem to move to smoothly theres just something odd about them,positive
you can tell that they have been animated on a computer,positive
of course the ship sinking scenes are awesome with bodies flying all over the place and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed,positive
titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film,positive
titanic then is a wonder of directing acting and cgi but not writing and story,positive
again like most of camerons films the editing is loose cameron edits himself and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts,positive
titanic then although not the godfather of movies it could of been is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius,positive
enjoyable scary and even sad titanic is a film cinema was invented for filling the screen with incredible images and assaulting the ears with awesome sound,positive
a superb film but sadly not perfect,positive
overall rating,positive
rated r for strong language sexual dialogue drug use crude humor violence and brief nudity,positive
starring ben affleck matt damon linda fiorentino salma hayek alan rickman chris rock kevin smith jason mewes jason lee george carlin alanis morissette,positive
running time 130 minutes,positive
being a huge fan of kevin smith i was expecting a lot out of his newest project dogma,positive
it might just be kevins best work to date,positive
its very funny with smart and foulmouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isnt,positive
in 1994 a little 27 000 movie premiered at sundance,positive
this little film was called clerks and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation,positive
you really cant meet a person on this green earth who has not seen clerks,positive
it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming,positive
in 1995 kevin made another movie mallrats that flopped horribly thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick,positive
it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 chasing amy came out and was kevins biggest success to date,positive
now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of dogma,positive
wow what a cast,positive
ok here is the plot in this movie linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic,positive
one day at her house metatron the voice of god appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels matt damon and ben affleck from getting back into heaven by ways of a church,positive
ok now get this she is told to find two prophets one who talks a lot and one who doesnt however she gets jay and silent bob instead who give us great performances,positive
now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky chris rock and helps guide her to find these angels,positive
salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way,positive
azrael jason lee who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win,positive
bethany linda fiorentino has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith,positive
what a movie it is everything rolled into one an offensive offbeat smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end and ends up being a feelgood movie,positive
who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself,positive
now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart,positive
yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god,positive
this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie,positive
kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie,positive
of course the best and funniest of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob,positive
probably the best characters in movies that i like,positive
the starstudded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while,positive
the script was written by kevin smith with many fwords in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isnt and makes us laugh at the same time as we think,positive
chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well with some classic lines,positive
linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is,positive
of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay as well as silent bob,positive
alan rickman jason lee salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles,positive
being oscar winners for the classic good will hunting they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could,positive
ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story,positive
the movies only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it,positive
however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members dogma stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to clerks,positive
while being funny at times in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but cant deny it,positive
dogma will offend people especially deeply religious people but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you,positive
all kevin smith fans must see,positive
the laserman somehow the title of writerdirectorproducer peter wangs film conjures up images of superheroes like ultraman and spiderman,positive
you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips,positive
as it turns out the laserman is about crime and about laser beams but there arent any superheroes,positive
instead wangs film is populated by a group of refreshingly offbeat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot new york city,positive
the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity eccentricity and electricity,positive
the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss marc hayashi a chineseamerican laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment,positive
he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds,positive
arthurs professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas,positive
his personal life on the other hand is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives,positive
in fact arthur is by far the blandest character in the film despite a charismatic performance by hayashi the san franciscobased actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii,positive
its the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark,positive
arthurs notsotypical jewish mother ruth for example is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body,positive
she has dyed her red hair black she takes herbal medicine daily and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies such as matzo balls in soy saucethe ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine,positive
veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it almost stealing the movie in the process,positive
she plays ruth as a driven woman determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture,positive
arthurs girlfriend janet maryann urbano is a kooky freespirit who would rather meditate than copulate her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation,positive
arthurs best friend joey tony leung is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns,positive
joey is married to arthurs jewish sister but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house,positive
arthurs 11yearold son jimmy played by the amazingly adorable david chan ishorror of horrorsbad at math,positive
he finds it impossible to meet his fathers lofty expectations,positive
the various people in arthurs life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity,positive
like wangs earlier film a great wall about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china the laserman revolves around cultural differences,positive
every character in the film is in some way or another trying to find his identitystruggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way,positive
the movie also offers a provocative look at technology,positive
wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu a detective who is fed up with machines even though he relies on them to do his job,positive
the film views technology with a wary eye acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers,positive
wang raises the timehonored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions,positive
was einstein responsible for the abomb,positive
is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers,positive
the movie pits spirituality against technology man against machine and the result is a draw,positive
according to the film technology has its place but we must employ it with great forethought and caution,positive
ironically by its very nature the laserman is a triumph of technologythe technology of filmmaking,positive
wangs direction is exquisite especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically crosscuts between the various subplots perhaps in homage to d w,positive
griffith,positive
cinematographer ernest dickerson who has worked on all of spike lees films gives the laserman a distinctive artistic look,positive
mason darings score which includes a sendup of bach is right on target,positive
the laserman is an ambitious endeavor which is to be applauded but its sometimes ambitious to a fault,positive
wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that its hard to digest them all,positive
for instance one character arthurs sister has negligible screen time and consequently we just dont care about her marital problems,positive
in weaving his web wang has included a few too many strands,positive
overall however the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction,positive
on the surface the film is a light and bouncy comedythriller overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style,positive
the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film,positive
you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town,positive
you may not have heard of lucas or if you have you might not think much of it,positive
probably because it stars corey haim or maybe because its about a little geek who collects insects or maybe because it doesnt feature slick oneliners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80s,positive
however you have been missing out on a true masterpeice the best film of 1986 and the best film about adolescent life ever made,positive
corey haim stars as lucas bligh a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair thick glasses and an interest in insects and other outdoor life,positive
one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him,positive
her name is maggie a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty with lovely red hair and a sweet innocent complexion,positive
maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her but somehow he interests her and soon they are talking and getting to know one another,positive
they gradually become good friends and spend the summer together doing various things such as studying insects namely locusts who come out of hiding once every 17 years playing tennis and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover,positive
lucas is obviously in love with maggie and while she is charmed by him its clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend,positive
this is not clear to lucas however,positive
he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows whats about to happen,positive
we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally,positive
they throw him on stage right in front of his beloved maggie,positive
surprisingly he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around but he takes it too far and is embarassed in front of the entire school,positive
the next scene is brilliant,positive
maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally,positive
she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened,positive
he rails back against her in a cruel unfair fashion,positive
in lesser movies this wouldve turned into a confrontation between the two characters,positive
but maggie is written smarter than that,positive
she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him,positive
next we are introduced to another great character named cappie charlie sheen,positive
he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend,positive
whats interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks,positive
of course anyone with a brain can tell whats gonna happen next,positive
cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas relationship,positive
this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone,positive
shes been assigned to show him how to operate the so he can clean his shirt,positive
maggie is charmed by cappies tender undertsanding demeanor not to mention his shirtless body,positive
this scene is so delicate and sweet but cappie still has a girlfriend preventing either one from acting on their desires,positive
desperately trying to puncture the tension cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room,positive
its not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend in the films only subpar scene,positive
lucas finally figures out whats going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance,positive
this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself such as try out for the football team,positive
the last third of the film revolves around this attempt,positive
while the idea seems cliched the way it is executed is not,positive
there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up,positive
dave grusins memorable score played at the perfect moments certainly helps,positive
lucas is filled with great performances,positive
forget everything you know about corey haim,positive
back in 1986 he had talent and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3dimensional performance filled with anger humor and pain,positive
kerri green is very appealing as maggie showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her,positive
sheens cappie is almost too good to be true but sheen makes him beleivable especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas,positive
there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popittis ben a friend of lucas whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks,positive
also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina the girl who admires lucas from afar,positive
when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s you hear john hughes this and john hughes that,positive
lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his socalled classics,positive
but hopefully like with heathers and say anything lucas can begin to find its own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald,positive
it deserves more than that but i dont want to be greedy,positive
carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven robocop came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall,positive
the film is a masterpiece of sets action and special effects,positive
action and science fiction just dont get any better than this,positive
the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid arnold schwarzenegger who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori sharon stone,positive
quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice a brain implant fake memory of a two week vacation on mars,positive
while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaids memory has previously been erased,positive
now the people who did it are after him,positive
quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead,positive
the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action special effects and twist after mindboggling twist,positive
it grabs you and never lets go,positive
this film is a winner from beginning to end,positive
the plot is superb combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a riproaring saga,positive
schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever and the supporting cast is good too,positive
the action and stunts are terrific,positive
the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail,positive
the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action,positive
the makeup effects by rob bottin the howling the thing and robocop are top notch not to mention extremely outlandish,positive
the visual effects by dream quest the abyss and industrial light and magic star wars trilogy jurassic park and terminator 2 are phenomenal,positive
the visuals had such a state of the art slickness that they won an oscar,positive
of course the film isnt always realistic its more fiction than science,positive
for example it is true that a body wont explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do,positive
who cares,positive
its a movie,positive
movies are supposed to entertain,positive
and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific it may be impossible to beat,positive
a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings,positive
a prime example of this is 1999s 10 things i hate about you which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school,positive
less successful was last years adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp here the setting was the corporate world of new york,positive
now comes o a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeares tragedies,positive
like 10 things i hate about you the stage is a high school a private prep school where odin james mekhi phifer is the oncourt general the basketball teams standout player,positive
julia stiles featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawkes hamlet plays desi brable odins girlfriend whose father also happens to be dean of the institution,positive
josh hartnett pearl harbor is on hand for the villainy playing the scheming hugo who sets the tragic wheels in motion,positive
o was actually filmed a couple of years ago but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy,positive
the movie directed by tim blake nelson best known for his costarring role in o brother where art thou,positive
and written by brad kaaya is very grim,positive
an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits,positive
and that is how it should be,positive
of all of shakespeares tragedies othello is the most harrowing not because of any body count but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery,positive
kaayas profanefilled script after all these are high school kids does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts,positive
the young man considers himself the basketball teams prime utility man who does a little bit of everything pass shoot rebound but is constantly in the shadow of odin,positive
plus his father the teams coach played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood,positive
the script follows the familiar lines of the classic,positive
hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desis fidelity eroding the stars confidence in those he considers closest to him affecting both his relationships and his game,positive
it all ends in blood of course which is why the movie was originally shelved,positive
the performances in o vary,positive
phifer is at first cocky and selfassured emotions he handles with ease,positive
he also does quite well displaying odins darker side his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution his growing distrust of those he loved his rage and the erosion of his belief system,positive
hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit turning friend against friend and lover against lover,positive
stiles seems a bit stilted but occasionally also rises to the occasion moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight,positive
the film does contain a few missteps a subplot involving hugos theft of the school mascot is left hanging,positive
also desis actions concerning michael andrew keegan odins former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugos machinations is puzzling,positive
why she would continually be seen with michael however innocent the circumstances when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back,positive
it is irrational,positive
but these are minor carpings,positive
overall o is a stylish and faithful adaptation,positive
if nothing else it may encourage some people to read the original text and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature,positive
the central focus of michael winterbottoms welcome to sarajevo is sarajevo itself the city under siege and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there,positive
it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents platoon racial tumultuosness the risible the walking dead or a tinge of schmaltziness schindlers list,positive
the two leads stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with are extremely believable not one moment with them involved rings false,positive
the question is not what went right,positive
the question is what went wrong,positive
for one the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs and thats about it,positive
the assortment of highprofile supporting actors ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter into liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable childrens aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters albeit they strive,positive
the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison,positive
still winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy frantic editing and imaginative use of music,positive
and its a plus because he doesnt toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness,positive
he wants us to know that in war no one is victorious,positive
the sweet hereafter,positive
starring ian holm sarah polley bruce greenwood tom mccamus gabrielle rose arsinee khanjian alberta watson maury chaykin caerthan banks,positive
produced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg,positive
script by atom egoyan based on the novel by russell banks,positive
directed by atom egoyan,positive
running time 110 mins,positive
rated r,positive
atom egoyans powerfully meditative the sweet hereafter is as anything as haunting and transcendental as ive seen this year,positive
it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety with cold and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected,positive
ian holm as the somber lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers hes a lion for the wrong reasons the pain for having lost his daughter shes a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money is reflected on the town,positive
and in some mesmerizing flashbacks we witness how she lost her purity,positive
its one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence ive ever seen,positive
but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly the peaceful benevolent girl who in contrast to the other characters remains the most mentally stable during past present or future,positive
her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite yet nearrevolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for breaking the waves,positive
both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see truly feel their wordless omnipotent love,positive
the sweet hereafter though is atom egoyans movie and as of now he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema,positive
after surging to worldwide recognition with 1994s exotica the sweet hereafter makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves an artist,positive
he interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common,positive
warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest craziest and hard hitting movie in his career,positive
based on a story concocted by himself and also written by beatty bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system,positive
beatty stars as senator jay bulworth whos going through a nervous breakdown,positive
after hiring someone to kill him he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about whats really happening in american politics much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy platt,positive
instead of everyone hating him the american public love him,positive
however inside his party more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin,positive
and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina berry,positive
its remarkable that this film was released at all,positive
much more open than the rather subdued primary colours bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name,positive
the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny and also somewhat true,positive
its great that beatty isnt afraid to let loose on a subject,positive
talking of beatty hes excellent in the role of the demented senator clearing having fun,positive
and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed,positive
even in dick tracy he was the most straighten face actor,positive
then again he was the only characters face we could completely see,positive
the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping which he does with gusto and also quite well,positive
and seeing beatty as a homeboy has to be seen to be believed,positive
its nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself,positive
second best is oliver platt as the flustered coke snorting assistant who goes over the top when he finally snaps,positive
halle berry is fine and sexy as the intellectual nina who comes to like the senator,positive
also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent laurie metcalf as the exact same characters shes also played and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife who all contribute to the fun,positive
and this being a political film the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance as shock himself,positive
the writing and directing both by beatty are above par,positive
the direction is very nearly sitcom like but suits the film perfectly and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well,positive
the script is funny and the raps are actually well produced and humorous and quite clever,positive
theyre not cringe inducing at least,positive
the script makes many points about society in america today and isnt afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system,positive
best of all the film is thought provoking but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather and is very entertaining,positive
theres also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes,positive
bulworth is a film with many advantages and few flaws,positive
perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping but beatty does it so well its irrelevant,positive
in fact theres very little against bulworth except for the language which is very heavy but then again it should be expected,positive
bulworth then is well worth watching,positive
a david wilcock review 1999,positive
you know for kids norville barnes,positive
every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre with dramas it was citizen kane with arthouse it was pulp fiction and with comedy it was well that jim carrey guy okay so hes not a movie but he did have a huge influence on the genre,positive
not to mention an expensive one,positive
sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big sprawling motion picture event as did forrest gump four years ago,positive
with action films it was aliens whic was released to much hype seven years after its equallyinnovative parent alien 1979,positive
directed and written by james cameron t2 judgement day the abyss true lies the authority on action films it was a masterful encore to his scifi thriller the terminator 1984,positive
while the original alien film was a dark enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew james cameron took the bigbudget action film with aliens which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing although on a muchlarger scale,positive
and boy did he take that route,positive
id say at about 165 mph or so,positive
the film opens 57 years after the original with lt ripley weaver being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel,positive
if youll recall at the end of alien ripley the only surviving member cryogenically hibernated herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship,positive
unfortunately she thought shed only be out for a couple of weeks,positive
once shes returned to earth ripley is quickly interrogated by the company who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy,positive
in truth they believe her as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an alien advisor,positive
it seems that the colony planet was a oncebreeding ground for the nasty aliens and now all communication with the planet has been lost,positive
it doesnt exactly take a genius to guess what happens next ripley agrees and before you can say big mistake she and the half dozen marines plus the slimy corporate guy reiser who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve are off to the colony,positive
when they arrive they find the planet in ruins,positive
only one survivor is found a little girl newt who confirms that yes the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system,positive
and soon enough the marines come under attack from the aliens,positive
what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien scifi movie the action scenes,positive
cameron directs them so skillfully and so suspensefully that youre literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around,positive
which features in my opinion the best fight scene ever recorded on film as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death,positive
many people will tell you that this film while being a great action film has no real drama and is all cliches,positive
well they would be wrong my friends,positive
if this film had no drama then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards,positive
thats right best actress,positive
you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and has got to be good,positive
in short aliens combines all the right elements great action and drama a good plot good dialogue and great villains into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time,positive
then again maybe not,positive
movies rise and fall from glory and sad to say aliens was wrestled from its throne of best action movie by another cameron film t2 judgement day in 1991,positive
so who will be the next king,positive
well lets wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron filmthe highest budgeted film of all timetitanic to make that decision,positive
i cant wait,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
among my fanatical ticker tapeworshipping friends theres one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofskys darkly original pi the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which through analysis will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour,positive
an example of the mentality involved if the stock price goes up like this and then down like that and then sharply up this way it then will go this way,positive
while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market knowledge check prices up good prices down bad most of the time at least and hence really couldnt comment with any authority its always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system and besides if it were that simple no doubt somebody wouldve already figured it all out,positive
the difference in this case is that while my colleague an otherwise assuredly realistic individual truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its characters psychosis,positive
its also vastly more convincing with its argument,positive
mathematics is the language of the universe insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen sean gullette in a cool mantralike voiceover which repeats throughout the picture,positive
since nature can be expressed in numbers and there are patterns everywhere in nature he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything the ups and downs of the stock market how many games the yankees will win this year the flavour of jam im going to put on my toast tomorrow morning,positive
obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe max lives in paranoid selfimposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment singlemindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system,positive
sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness,positive
the story then is basically an eccentricity but its a clever astute eccentricity perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism in an age where a dominant societal phobia is ones individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers maxs allconsuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering unsettling mood,positive
it helps matters that hes not a particularly likable protagonist,positive
all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max a spindly neuroticlooking individual who hasnt the time to indulge in pleasantries,positive
for a film which puts its lead character front and center mr gullette appears in virtually every scene pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics because of our ambivalence with max were not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as were following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination its more disturbing journey than quest,positive
still we do care about maxs fate,positive
teetering on the edge of dementia he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain both fronted by deliciously perky resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions,positive
as we know in films where paranoia is a dominant element see the truman shows laura linney character or for that matter in real life its always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary,positive
pi a film that addresses patterns itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle headache scene important revelation or bit of plot development pillpopping montage hallucinatory nightmare with decidedly cronenbergesque undertones few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and bodythemed horror nosebleeding reality,positive
the repetitiveness far from being tedious is effectively maddening more than anything the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from maxs claustrophobic perspective,positive
in this regard it wildly succeeds due to mr aronofskys striking direction,positive
its a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonists warped perspective of his surrounding and high contrast blackandwhite cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme closeups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings,positive
in some scenes the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr gullette make his character curiously resemble a latterday max schreck from nosferatu,positive
using savage jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation the picture is often dizzying to behold and maxs effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the socalled snorri cam which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts,positive
pis raw aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynchs early work in particular eraserhead,positive
the films sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell and gradually increases in intensity,positive
still amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood pi does occasionally display a sense of humour,positive
at one point marcy dawson pamela hart great fun entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure a oneofakind,positive
computer chip,positive
isnt it beautiful she coos,positive
a showcase for mr aronofskys technical virtuosity made for 60 000 its since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which ironically is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year,positive
the fighting sullivans contains a major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away,positive
there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film as i knew exactly what was going to happen,positive
and thats the worst thing that can happen before viewing a movie,positive
because of this i will tread lightly so i dont ruin it for anyone reading this review and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it,positive
the fighting sullivans revolves around a family that consists of a mother father sister and five brothers,positive
the brothers are very close despite the occasional disagreement,positive
they are inseperable and never stray from one another,positive
their friendship and loyalty is the foundation of this picture,positive
the first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children and their various adventures,positive
when four of them get into a fight with some local boys the youngest sullivan who is inside a church at the time comes running out to assist but not before properly exiting the chapel,positive
if im being awfully vague about details its because what i have told you is essentially the first hour and a half,positive
all i can say is go watch this film because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together through the good and the bad,positive
and after you see the movie you will understand why this review has been written the way it has,positive
lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie ok so maybe it is but this one is enjoyable and clever,positive
actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film,positive
well the ending is kinda scary but in most they are,positive
i will admit that lake placid isnt an oscar worthy film but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny,positive
bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth after a man is bit in half,positive
she gets there but really doesnt understand why she is there,positive
bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man they go out and find what is going on,positive
what they find though isnt great,positive
a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid over 150 years old he has migrated here for who knows why,positive
they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from,positive
betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid and well youll have to see the movie to find out,positive
her character is very funny and foulmouthed which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad but funny,positive
to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws,positive
with the opening sequence and some others it is not original and is,positive
when you watch this movie you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it,positive
david e kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job,positive
the characters have smartmouths two foul and some great oneliners,positive
but believe me dont take lake placid too seriously or you wont like it,positive
but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun popcorn type movie,positive
but i guess it rates above the popcorn rating,positive
sit back watch the movie laugh scream and whatever you want,positive
even though the movie is r and i put violence and gore,positive
theres really not that much gore but what there is might seem kinda gross to some,positive
lake placid is a smart clever funny and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too,positive
the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchables is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry,positive
based on the 1959 television show of the same title the untouchables may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences some excellent acting a memorable score and a clever script,positive
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public,positive
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order,positive
however as ness soon learns in order to stabilize peace you have to bend a few laws,positive
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes,positive
the film begins with capone played perfectly by deniro declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws,positive
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capones men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl,positive
from this point we know capone is evil not only because he kills without hesitation but also because he is a lying bastard,positive
right from the first five minutes of the film de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs,positive
this developed hatred is before the films hero ness is even introduced,positive
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone,positive
the film only gets better from this point,positive
with the formation of the untouchables there is a group of men wearing long dark overcoats and hats,positive
they walk in unison and they only look forward,positive
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens,positive
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films,positive
one that comes to mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world,positive
wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930s style the similarities between these two are countless,positive
the untouchables has some of the hippest bravest heroes in any action film,positive
the four members were the only ones willing to go against capones army,positive
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others,positive
elliot ness played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner is a character that surely grows during the course of the film,positive
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be,positive
however as the film develops so does ness,positive
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side,positive
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends,positive
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in,positive
sean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role plays malone an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables,positive
malone acts as a mentor to ness,positive
he teaches him the chicago way to do things when they attack with a knife you attack with a gun,positive
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed,positive
andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone a young man who is just becoming a police officer,positive
as ness grows he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him,positive
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone,positive
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film,positive
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen,positive
also very similar to the matrix they are exciting and intense,positive
from a westernlike battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps the scenes are well thought out and well executed,positive
the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement,positive
its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors,positive
the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective,positive
although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting great directing and great action,positive
some scenes capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid,positive
an unhappy italian housewife a lonely waiter a goofy masseuse lots of love and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips which proves charming despite its covering of predictable wellworn material,positive
the story concerns the aforementioned housewife rosalba barletta licia maglietta who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation,positive
instead of waiting for a ride home rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town but to instead hitchhike to venice,positive
upon arriving she tells her selfcentered husband mimmo an excellent antonio catania that shell be home in a few days,positive
of course that doesnt happen as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries,positive
in what seems like days she moves in with lonely suicidal waiter fernando bruno ganz gets a job as a florist learns the accordion and befriends her neighbor a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia marina massironi,positive
rosalba who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando,positive
i can think of at least five other american movies including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman that are more than similar to bread and tulips,positive
but maglietta and ganz who act with restraint and care help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread,positive
ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world,positive
throughout the movie maglietta has an easygoing confident demeanor which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganzs character,positive
the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up,positive
director and cowriter silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor,positive
the cheap mimmo desperate to find his wife after all he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wont do it hires a job applicant giuseppe battiston at his bathroom supply firm to do the job,positive
the reason,positive
mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories,positive
the novice detectives various misfortunes including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother are very funny,positive
unfortunately there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips cheery tone,positive
rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice which bring the movie to a halt,positive
its like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie,positive
several details in fernandos life also never get proper closure including his suicidal tendencies,positive
early in the movie he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door,positive
after that fernandos step towards death is never made reference to probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm underdeveloped subplot about fernandos stormy past,positive
it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesnt need any,positive
but there arent a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips,positive
the movie is fun and romantic with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives wed like to live if we had the nerve,positive
or if our passports werent missing,positive
logical time travel movies are a nearimpossibility,positive
considering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task,positive
occasionally we get a film that does manage it,positive
terry gilliams 12 monkeys was one such film,positive
but more frequently we get films that dont much deal with it at all,positive
there is one question to ask in this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies,positive
the terminator films made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own,positive
is frequency filled with plot holes,positive
yes,positive
does it matter,positive
not really,positive
the film opens in october of 1969,positive
firefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson,positive
the doublepronged story flashes forward to 1999 where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as a police detective,positive
a strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in 69 and that john has found in the present day,positive
though both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom,positive
now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women,positive
frank and john now must work together to set things right with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past,positive
the premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions,positive
this isnt explained you just have to go with it,positive
when frank doesnt die in a fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way,positive
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities 1969 and 1999 are to each other,positive
sometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time,positive
now the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if i thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations arent really the point,positive
when frequency gets cooking its a riveting little thriller even if it is confusing,positive
what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving,positive
the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion,positive
director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved,positive
i liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward,positive
it actually uses the 1969 metsorioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him,positive
admittedly this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself,positive
i even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods,positive
some may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script a lot of leeway and lets face it its a darn cool way to end the film,positive
there are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency to keep you on your toes and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant,positive
the other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the fatherson relationship,positive
quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily its a rocksolid job from both actors,positive
the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative or with a future descendant,positive
watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question,positive
the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we dont believe in the characters we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot,positive
here we do care because we like the lead actors,positive
i also liked some of the supporting cast members,positive
elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably,positive
andre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives a nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john,positive
he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes,positive
braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused,positive
perhaps the only thing i didnt like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard,positive
but thats only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics,positive
i freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as a guy movie since it focuses on the very maleoriented idea of fatherson relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable,positive
who wouldnt want to speak with a longdead parent,positive
or see how their children turn out,positive
tell me about your life son excuse me while i mist up,positive
and dont call me a sissy,positive
synopsis shrek myers is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad john lithgow,positive
farquaad agrees to relocate the pests on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona diaz whom farquaad desires to wed from a faroff castle,positive
grudgingly shrek sets out joined in his quest by an unwanted companion donkey murphy,positive
review one memorable aspect of disneys aladdin was that it finally gave robin williams a character the genie to best take advantage of his comic talents,positive
shrek does the same for eddie murphy ironically though murphys ideal vessel turns out to be an ass,positive
all the same shrek does represent murphys best comic outing in years and as donkey he steals all the best lines,positive
for instance after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature donkey soars into the air and scoffs now im a flying talking donkey,positive
and despite its many contributors the script for shrek is full of such comic gems,positive
myers is delightful in more of a straight man role and lithgow also gets some great moments watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man,positive
shrek takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain,positive
things do go somewhat astray during the films middle segment which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movies greatest strength,positive
but even then one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology,positive
its not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts,positive
but thats just what happened to me at uhf weird al yankovics big screen debut,positive
uhf is a television parody a la airplane and like airplane the movie is extraordinarily stupid,positive
but its dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb its so silly and outrageous its hilarious,positive
the movie stars weird al as george newman a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination the type who fantasizes hes indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns,positive
george is basically a loser his daydreams and smartalec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks,positive
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station,positive
george revives channel 62 with innovative programming shows like wheel of fish and movies like conan the librarian,positive
as the stations ratings rise it comes into competition with channel 8 the leading vhf networkaffiliate,positive
as r j,positive
fletcherchannel 8s illnatured hardnosed ownerveteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy he really hams it up with his snorts grimaces and scowls,positive
uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television including game shows tabloid talk shows childrens shows dizzy news women and movieseverything from rambo to close encounters,positive
the funniest scene the one that made my head spin is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed,positive
like most movies in its genre uhf is hit or miss,positive
for every gag that works at least one fizzles,positive
for instance weird als mock video of money for nothing by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt although it does have some nifty computer animation,positive
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail we know another gut wrencher is on the way,positive
in fact uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplanetype movie since,positive
well since airplane,positive
much of the credit goes to weird als exceptionally inventive script and to the movies winsome cast,positive
weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning but because hes not afraid to look silly he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character,positive
the real standout is michael richards as stanley the dimwitted janitor who becomes the host of his own childrens show stanley spadowskis playhouse,positive
stanleys offbeat mixedup personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an overnight star,positive
he is an endearing mixture of goodnatured innocence highenergy enthusiasm and puppydog cuteness,positive
and above all hes a good janitor who adores his work,positive
another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips,positive
the cast also features gedde watanabe the chinese foreignexchange student in sixteen candles as the karate master who hosts the hit series wheel of fish,positive
also aboard for the ride is fran drescher who plays pamela finklestein channel 62s roving reporter,positive
unfortunately as weird als girlfriend victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering whining and sulking,positive
her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether,positive
while uhf is not an absolute mustsee its definitely the ticket if youre looking for a wild and zany whackedout comedy,positive
the movie is good enough to see in the theaters but it may work even better on television the very medium at which it pokes fun,positive
what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection,positive
sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have i will prefer it to a bettermade film that is not as thoughtprovoking,positive
the thin red line is flawed but it provokes,positive
terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war,positive
unlike this years saving private ryan which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof the thin red line simply says war is waste,positive
while that might seem obvious to some only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is,positive
saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs,positive
one message is not necessarily more correct than the other,positive
it just depends on ones point of view,positive
in malicks film war is set in a tropical paradise and john tolls cinematography is beyond lush,positive
the setting poses the question why are we fighting in the face of such beauty,positive
in saving private ryan the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go,positive
in the thin red line the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place,positive
they are just like the americans frightened and angry grieving and praying,positive
all that separates them is war,positive
the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voiceovers,positive
unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious sometimes corny the voiceovers tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary,positive
dispensing with them malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur,positive
instead he gets distracting selfconsciousness,positive
aside from that malicks direction is stunning,positive
the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary,positive
sean penn elias koteas and nick nolte give the best performances,positive
penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle,positive
john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles,positive
ultimately however the thin red lines interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama,positive
it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure but malick clearly has different things on his mind,positive
has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative,positive
what malick is working with is theme and in that the thin red line is most provoking,positive
bruce willis is a typecasted actor,positive
in die hard he played john mcclaine a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time,positive
again in pulp fiction as butch coolidge an overthehill boxer he steps on the wrong guys toes,positive
in luc bessons the fifth element willis plays korben dallas a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time,positive
a stylish science fiction epic the fifth elements complex plot begins right away in the deserts of egypt think stargate in 1914,positive
an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the 5 elements are stored and takes them away vowing to return them when the evil comes back,positive
cut to present day which is our future,positive
the year is 2023 and new york is the city,positive
the only basic differences between bessons futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker the buildings are higher and the traffic floats,positive
anyway the evil comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth so back come the tortoiselike aliens to return the 5 elements to earth in order to defend themselves against the evil,positive
in the process however the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing,positive
when officials arrive at the site all that remains is a hand,positive
what can you do with a hand,positive
hey its the 21st century heredna reconstruction,positive
this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful but mysterious woman named leeloo milla jovovich dazed and confused,positive
she escapes and attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korbens floating cab,positive
its love at first site as korben and leeloo elude the lazyasalways cops,positive
when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ian holm night falls on manhattan korben searches the yellow pages and delivers her to the door of the good reverend the only man who knows of her background and duties,positive
now korben leeloo and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship special effects were spectacular here to find the remaining four elements,positive
it is here where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jeanbaptiste emmanuel zorg gary oldman murder in the first,positive
he too wants possession of the elements as do a group of piglike warriors think the gamorreans in return of the jedi,positive
in a spectacular ending with time running out leeloo is faced with a problemwhy should she save a people who live to destroy each other,positive
the question is a good one and one that could be pondered,positive
but enough of that,positive
when korben points out his love for her leeloo is inclined to become the 5th element and save the world from total destruction,positive
the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain who reminded me a lot of jack nicholsons the joker in batman by one of the masters of villainy oldman and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich,positive
the supporting cast which includes brion james tango cash tim tiny lester no holds barred luke perry buffy the vampire slayer and chris tucker friday added a comedic effect to the film,positive
although bessons the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches it is a solid motion picture with a definite point,positive
some other directors like anacondas luis llosa should take a lesson from this guyusing ideas from epic motion pictures the right way,positive
ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film,positive
scifi fan or not any movielover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture,positive
synopsis in this movie steven spielberg one of todays finest directors attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque djimon hounsou a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery and his fellow prisoners,positive
cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders but since the americans dont speak cinques language the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves,positive
technically since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time people like cinque couldnt be kidnapped into slavery one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave,positive
lawyers baldwin and adams matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery rather than born slaves in order to get them out of prison as free men,positive
three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielbergs trademark panache flashy beginning lots of facial closeups big music and dramatic imagery,positive
a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters,positive
opinion making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life,positive
in fiction one invents purposeful clearcut good guys and bad guys puts the fictional characters in conflict and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion,positive
real life however consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around think thoughts and do nothing or come and go before events are resolved,positive
spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story,positive
djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances,positive
matthew broderick and high school comedy,positive
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986,positive
now it is 13 years later and broderick has another high school comedy election to show the world,positive
ferris buehlers day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows,positive
it was light fluffy tasty and sparkling clean,positive
but election is far different,positive
this production is a dark and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies it shocks as well,positive
jim mcallister matthew broderick is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud,positive
he is a kind caring younger man who has built his life around carver high school,positive
in turn carver high school has provided a home for him,positive
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body,positive
tracy flick reese witherspoon is an intelligent outgoing and to quote the film super nice young girl,positive
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities always has her hand up first in class and is extremely popular among most of the student body,positive
so it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president,positive
the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one,positive
the father dick holmes osborne owns a cement company,positive
the mother jo jeanine jackson is an ideal housewife,positive
and the two children paul chris klein and tammy jessica campbell are both students at carver high school,positive
paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school,positive
tammy is a lesbian who to say the least is going through a period of self discovery,positive
for reasons of revenge hatred and sexual envy jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president,positive
he claims that in a democracy you need choices and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts,positive
so paul agrees and the race is on,positive
but then in an effort to spite the two candidates tammy announces that she is running as well,positive
her campaign is straightforward people only run to put it on their college applications then they do nothing,positive
well i dont even want to go to college she says,positive
in election there are no good guys,positive
almost everyone has their own agenda,positive
no matter how deeply hidden the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience,positive
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school,positive
she is the girl that would be labeled most likely to achieve anything she wants in the yearbook and everyone secretly envied her because of that,positive
jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege and uses it to his own amoral advantage,positive
everyone including the principal a former teacher all the candidates and even pauls girlfriend are two sided characters,positive
that is much of this films beauty it doesnt have the typical good guys that hollywood likes instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves,positive
matthew broderick couldnt have been any more perfect for this role,positive
his character is often similar bill murrays award winning role in the 1998 film rushmore,positive
of the two acting jobs brodericks is far superior,positive
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon,positive
the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her is simply indescribable,positive
broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes,positive
one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day,positive
you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures making her an eligible candidate,positive
and his subtle disgust with her is apparent although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face,positive
the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience,positive
but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part,positive
however the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl,positive
this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her socalled platform for presidency,positive
she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed,positive
if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools and gave you an innocent laugh or two then the movie achieved its goal,positive
but dont you dare think that elections goals are similar,positive
it is just as real in its portrayal of high school as its characters are in the real world,positive
there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here,positive
waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury joe says after all were human,positive
in the context of events to transpire joes line is prophetic foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film,positive
does being human necessarily imply humane behavior,positive
through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility,positive
expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria,positive
in the scene prefacing the lynching the mob achieves critical mass at the bar,positive
deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant but when he is unable to augment the mobs myth of joe he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip,positive
we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar,positive
what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse,positive
what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless,positive
to the audience the deputys quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mobs delirium crescendos,positive
lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera but rather its stillness,positive
the shots composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions,positive
as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers it does so around the viewer as well,positive
the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality,positive
because the camera does not track the deputys movement we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability,positive
as the bar scene progresses the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob,positive
this shot is unique because it is a pointofview shot where the audience not a character in the film is the subject,positive
while a long or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob panning from the mobs belly distorts the audiences spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large,positive
we see close shots of peoples faces contorted by their rage,positive
with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching,positive
in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob langs camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail,positive
in some greater sense it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind,positive
langs observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior,positive
as joe faces his peril trapped in his burning cell his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side,positive
lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts,positive
using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality lang depicts mans volatility and impulse towards inconceivable cruelty,positive
reprising joe s line at the train station we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity,positive
plot this movie takes place over one day,positive
its a rookie cops narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran,positive
the rookie doesnt know much about street justice so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the real world,positive
how even cops like themselves have to bend the rules and break the law every now and then in order to catch the really bad guys,positive
critique a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board some ups some downs and a thrilling ending despite a couple of small flaws,positive
i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place,positive
the film gets right into the dirty side of well the,positive
dirt on the streets and proceeds to teach the rookie cop and us the audience how things really work down there,positive
of course were receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time but the things he seems to be doing arent exactly on the upandup either,positive
and therein lies the fun of the film,positive
do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones,positive
well as the film moves along were given two points of view in respect to this predicament and to me both sides made sense at some point or another,positive
and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that the director who builds the film up wonderfully with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades,positive
hawke first off because he rarely plays these commercial roles but does so perfectly here with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top,positive
and denzel well what can you say about mr washington that hasnt already been said before,positive
he comes through as per his usual highlevel style here and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent of which i personally would like to see more,positive
hes nice hes not so nice hes smart hes not so smart hes caring and hes a dog all the way,positive
the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point okay we get it you,positive
have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people move on and this one really major coincidence which involved a bathtub that saved the day for one character but seemed a little too convenient for my taste,positive
i also never really understood how washingtons character got out of a certain dire predicament only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene,positive
but obviously these small flaws didnt taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama a film that gets you right into the streets into the nooks and the crannies and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the daytoday drug busts,positive
see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry onscreen and see it if you like holding on to your seathandles real tight during a movie,positive
in fact see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gangbangers alone dang now thats intense,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
the corruptor 710 crimson tide 910 l a confidential 10 lethal weapon 810 requiem for a dream 810 seven 1010 shaft 710 traffic 810,positive
the disney studios has its formula for annual fulllength animated features down so pat that its hard to remember which one youre watching at any given moment,positive
mulan their 36th animated adventure is the latest case in point,positive
once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character female as usual disney is one of the few studios whose heroinesariel belle pocahontas and now mulanget equal screen time with their heroes in recent years,positive
add the requisite love interest and a wisecracking sidekick or two pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror a rousing anthem a cutesy montagebacked crowd pleaser pose a few threats to our engaging lead and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits,positive
bobs your uncle,positive
better make that walts your uncle,positive
kids will no doubt go gaga over mulan or at least the fast food tieins but familiarity can after a while leave grownupsthis reviewer includedwishing for a little more,positive
maybe an animated feature withoutshock,positive
horror the,positive
songs for example,positive
or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad,positive
how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether,positive
it isnt gonna happen,positive
like disneys previous entries mulan is slow to make its mark,positive
the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element a madcap dragon wannabe in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth courtesy eddie murphys animated vocal talents plays like an inappropriate if necessary formulawise afterthought,positive
however after about an hour everything comes together and the formula like it or not clicks,positive
highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snowcovered pass which due to the sophistication of todays computergenerated imagery is hard to tell from the real thing a memorable showstopping musical interlude ill make a man out of you penned by matthew wilder and david zippel and last but not least mulan herself,positive
voiced by mingna wen mulan is disneys strongest female character to date,positive
when hordes of huns pour over chinas great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army,positive
since mulans father is infirm but proud the highspirited mulan steals her fathers armor and incognito signs up to face the mongolian menace,positive
attracted to but not distracted by her commanding officer shang b d,positive
wong mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts wit and physical ability,positive
shes a woman of the 90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time,positive
as i walked out of crouching tiger hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film,positive
with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a great piece of work and viceversa,positive
attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs,positive
i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology,positive
as the word implies a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master,positive
as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality,positive
crouching tiger hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category,positive
crouching tiger hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore with the requisite blend of legend fantasy magic and mythology,positive
it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be halfgods greater than life purer than life stronger than life physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable,positive
all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement,positive
the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil which must choose between the two,positive
it is the gifted pupil who under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend,positive
the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters are poignantly represented,positive
the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively,positive
the fight scenes are stunning balletic toursdeforce not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art as are the prodigious leaps and flights to from and between rooftops the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake,positive
there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry,positive
as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line which takes place at an ordinary human level yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy,positive
do not assume however that the art is limpwristed,positive
for those who are put off by the art label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure action and romance,positive
there are no weak performances in this movie,positive
michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth humanity and wisdom,positive
chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart,positive
zhang ziyi is a budding superstar,positive
she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role,positive
cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably,positive
kudos to screenwriters james schamus wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing choreographer yuen woping photography director peter pau and music director tan dun each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film,positive
ang lee as the director coproducer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit,positive
this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes including those who hate martial arts movies,positive
dont miss it,positive
trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors steve buscemi,positive
he gave memorable performences in in the soup fargo and reservoir dogs,positive
now he tries his hand at writing directing and acting all in the same flick,positive
the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy buscemi hanging around a local bar the trees lounge and him pestering his brother,positive
its obvious he a loser,positive
but as he says its better im a loser and know i am then being a loser and not thinking i am,positive
well put,positive
the story starts to take off when his uncle dies and tommy not having a job decides to drive an ice cream truck,positive
well the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie chloe sevigny and,positive
i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation,positive
after youve seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs you know he is capable of a better performence,positive
i think his brother michael did an excellent job for his debut performence,positive
mr buscemi is off to a good career as a director,positive
the thoughtprovoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of leila a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirtyyear career to gain u s distribution thanks to first run features,positive
although unfamiliar with mehrjuis previous directing efforts perhaps the reason for this is that while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers,positive
set in modernday iran leila begins on the birthday of the title character leila hatami after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband reza ali mosaffa,positive
as leila and reza set off to visit his parents and then hers where a birthday celebration has been planned things seem rosy for the couple on the outside but for leila life isnt quite as sweet,positive
earlier on that very same day leila had gone to see her physician and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child,positive
when all of the conditions are ruled out and leila passes up the possibility of adoption reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her and doesnt care at all about having children,positive
nonetheless leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby which is the societal norm and her selfesteem is not helped at all by her domineering motherinlaw jamileh sheikhi whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news reza is her only son,positive
bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with,positive
leila hesitantly agrees and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesnt give her full blessing,positive
there are no easy answers to be found within leila a film that thoughtfully examines the central characters unfortunate plight as well as the inner workings of leila herself told through matteroffact narration,positive
almost completely taken over by her own shame she has no option but to agree to her forceful motherinlaws requests even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman,positive
maybe because leila is from iran the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence,positive
leila however is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy no matter what the circumstances,positive
one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza who married only three months after their first meeting but obviously love each other very deeply,positive
it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible,positive
although seemingly unimportant at first glance an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing nearly uncontrollably actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another,positive
ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her,positive
these small moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn outraging sequences in the latter half in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman,positive
left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage foolishly unbeknownst to reza leila prays each time that the date will not go well so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer,positive
refusing to stay over at her parents house the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below,positive
despite her initial agreement to such a thing leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him,positive
sure the whole second marriage was his mothers idea but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children then he could have still easily backed out couldnt he,positive
in the pivotal role of leila who appears in every scene leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength unavoidable vulnerability and utter despair,positive
unlike most american films in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words,positive
every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa as reza a man who i believe does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else,positive
for all of its strong aspects leila isnt a perfect film,positive
on a technical level i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed,positive
and concerning the plot developments the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before,positive
mehrjuis decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful motherinlaw played memorably by jamileh sheikhi,positive
despite these minor missteps leila is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new yorks cinema village and then on may 21 in la,positive
the thoughtprovoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales and when the climax arrives leilas selfworth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation to which there is no return,positive
its difficult to not consider how leilas culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme was going through,positive
i know it already opened in december but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price,positive
as the final scene closed out in happy slowmo fashion i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking,positive
jason schwartzman his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses steals the show as max fischer the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades but compensates for it by organizing most of the schools clubs and organizations i e,positive
the fencing team and writing and producing school plays and often pulling outrageous stunts one that eventually earns him an expulsion,positive
this stunt building an aquarium on the schools baseball diamond is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross olivia williams,positive
he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume a very oscarworthy bill murray who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross,positive
rosemary and herman begin datingand the fun begins herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross,positive
herman manages to destroy maxs bike while max cuts hermans brakes and it goes on like this,positive
but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross and he cant stand in the way of two people in love,positive
the academy of arts sciences really messed up this year they completely overlooked rushmore and if you ask me it wasnt an accident,positive
it maybe wasnt best picture material but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod instead of elizabeth and bill murrays absense from the ballot is a complete snub,positive
the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good at one point its fun and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic,positive
the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling as well,positive
i hope rushmore can overcome its oscar snubs and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers,positive
another independent film this comedy which was brought by miramax for 5 million is good fun,positive
favreau and vaughn the lost world jurassic park 1997 play mike and trent two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women,positive
the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve and along the way we get to meet some of their friends see their attempts at chatting up girls and just basically get a insight into their lives,positive
and all of this is great fun,positive
swingers doesnt rely on huge special effects or big name stars to provide entertainment,positive
no it just has a great script and superb little known actors,positive
the script by favreau is great,positive
mike is always missing is girlfriend who hasnt called him for six months and every time he meets a girl he always end up telling her about the ex,positive
the audience feels for this pathetic little man thanks to the great script,positive
vaughn is the money swingers speak for the best as the womanizing trent always on the lookout for a new girl,positive
some of his chatup lines are awful but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his hard man nature,positive
vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film towards the end in a diner,positive
the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great but it never quite reaches tarantino standards which i suspect the film was trying to reach,positive
there are some excellent laugh out loud jokes in the film and some superbly funny set pieces such as favreau cringeworhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence,positive
embarrassing to him hilarious to the audience,positive
mike trents friends are also good although there characters seem a bit underwritten and we never really learn as much as we would like about them,positive
although this is primarily mike and trents film it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends,positive
they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background,positive
but again the lines they say are usually pretty good and they do have some funny parts,positive
its just a shame that they didnt have more meatier roles,positive
the acting is superb,positive
as said above vaughn is superb as trent hes definitely the best thing in the film,positive
favreau is also good acting as the little man very well and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny,positive
graham boogie nights 1997 has a small but good role as lorraine a girl mike finally falls in love with,positive
she hardly features in the film at all but she still manages to make an impact on the audience,positive
swingers then is funny but it does have some flaws,positive
firstly the running time is a bit too short,positive
the film comes to an abrupt halt and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer,positive
it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion which is a shame as most films are too long,positive
also this type of film has been done too many times such as sleep with me 1994,positive
but these small flaws dont really spoil what is a funny entertaining comedy,positive
since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what theyre portraying its fitting to say that beloved come as a real shock as a film,positive
its confusing bizarre and as tough a film to watch as any film ive seen all year and thats not necessarily because of the threehour running time,positive
beloved is challenging to watch filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard and instead of a straightforward hollywoodized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed beloved comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened or rather toni morrison who wrote the novel upon which this is based,positive
beloved tells the story of an exslave named sethe played by oprah winfrey who lives on a large farm in the north with her children,positive
when the film opens her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist which shakes things up wounds the dog and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family,positive
sethe is proud though and will not move,positive
her sons run away leaving only her and her daughter denver kimberly elise alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation,positive
a couple years pass and the ghost remains and one day a man named paul d danny glover another exslave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together arrives asking for lodging,positive
he has been wandering around since he left the plantation and when he enters the house it turns red and becomes incredibly hot,positive
when he remarks about what he thinks is evil sethe replies it aint evil,positive
its just sad,positive
some more time passes and paul d has become a fervent member of the household and the ghost disappears,positive
but when they return one day from going out they discover a young woman sitting in the house,positive
her name is beloved and as played by thandie newton she has almost zero motor skills,positive
she stumbles around halfgrabbing onto things and knocking them over and when she speaks she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk,positive
they let her into her house and she begins to turn things upside down,positive
beloved acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story,positive
most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic lowlit room with the occasional flash to the past where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modernday psychoanalysts,positive
sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands with her nipples being licked prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it they took my milk,positive
worst of all was the month after her freedom when she was allowed to live like a free person working with other blacks on a farm and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back,positive
she runs to the barn near by carrying her four children and when her old owners burst in they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they dont leave them alone,positive
when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film she says she doesnt regret it,positive
she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did and she has convinced herself she did the right thing,positive
of course beloved is really her daugher materialized though we arent flat out told that until later on in the film,positive
beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long,positive
thus beloved becomes a sortaredux of the andrei tarkofsky scifi classic solaris where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife who commited suicide years before has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system,positive
that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us it would control us completely,positive
beloved moves along freely without a lot of explanation and for the most part this is extremely respectable,positive
the most interesting films are the ones that dont explain everything for us leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense,positive
sethe is never fully explained as a character but we understand all her actions since shes being played by oprah winfrey,positive
its been well over a decade since her last major performance in the color purple but judging from these two films ill bet shes one of the best actresses working today if,positive
she was strictly an actress,positive
her talk show which i suppose is a great entity has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress and thats a shame because she brings so much to this movie,positive
emotion,positive
sadness,positive
strength,positive
watching the strong sethe whos so afraid of the past that shes built a rather strong protective coating around herself break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great,positive
she makes it real,positive
thats not to say this is a perfect film,positive
in fact id wager to say that the fact that its confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is,positive
while oprahs performance is powerful and easily sympathetic and im dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february the structure of the film which doesnt show what happened to her children till halfway through the film prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film,positive
it doesnt necessarily move as though theyre memories of one particular character and by the end it has lost control over sethe and as she takes to bed we are unable to truly identify with her anymore,positive
but despite its tediousness perhaps thats the point,positive
the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable and it needs to get back with reality,positive
and for the most part this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be,positive
jonathan demmes direction is bizarre in nature with the story and he creates the right mood making it a tough film to sit through making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters,positive
theres more to admire here like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization just like they would be in real life and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering but laced with a touch of optimism,positive
the acting not only from winfrey is amazing and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination,positive
everyone has been raving about thandie newtons performance and how it should be rewarded,positive
however it must be noted that out of everyone she had the easiest part,positive
act like a baby,positive
throw things,positive
stumble around,positive
chew food with your mouth open,positive
i do think theres another performance worthy of oscar conisderation but its kimberly elise as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane and has to carry the burden of her mothers loss of reality towards the end,positive
its not that newton isnt great shes as annoying and wacky as the role demands,positive
its just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better,positive
despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it and not that of writer morrison or director demme beloved has still not done well,positive
costing i think around ninety million dollars it has since grossed about twentytwo,positive
unfortunately this film is a little too intense for viewers even for me and i can stand almost anything i recently viewed the 2 12 hour long epic caligula the worst film i have ever seen in my life and did it in a mere 2 sittings,positive
although i respect beloved i cant say that i really enjoyed it,positive
an astonishingly difficult movie to watch the last temptation of christ may be scorseses most important film and yet his most impossibly abstract as well,positive
scorsese presents the life of jesus christ through nikos kazantzakis novel which details the life of christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion,positive
jesus of nazareth dafoe is a carpenter who opens the film making crosses so that he can escape the fate he is subjected to his destiny on earth,positive
yet he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others and subjects himself to a desert in exile in hopes that he can reach god,positive
before leaving he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene barbara hershey a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus,positive
20,positive
after going to the desert christ learns his true purpose in life and what he must do,positive
aided by judas keitel he sets off on teaching the world his message,positive
along the way he meets john the baptist the rest of the prophets and tries to teach the world his message,positive
christ is also confronted by internal demons and selfdoubt as he tries to find his true purpose throughout the entire film,positive
during the story judas is the closese ally of jesus his betrayal argues the film was not out of hate but out of love in order to allow christ to die,positive
20,positive
he is eventually captured and crucified as per the bibile,positive
however as he is about to die on the cross he is saved by a girl who brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene,positive
the girl is a guardian angel who is from god and who has saved him from his death,positive
jesus goes on to live a life as a man as a carpenter and does not die on the cross,positive
on his deathbed in the final moments of his life he is visited by the prophets and by judas who denounces his master for not keeping his end of the bargain,positive
judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act,positive
jesus escapes from his deathbed and asks his father for forgiveness for succumbing to his last temptation,positive
visually and aurally the film is absolutely breathtaking,positive
no other director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of christs life to the screen,positive
peter gabriel contributes a score than is simply astonishing with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer,positive
the performances are simply exquisite with dafoe leading the way with a mesmerizing turn as jesus,positive
keitel although his accent is a problem is passionately brilliant fighting through language to bring the character to life,positive
the visuals are also amazing,positive
scorsese frames his movie in a harsh tone leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is having human frailties,positive
the film though has many trouble spots,positive
paul schraders script is one,positive
schrader uses modernday new york english to tell the story along with new york words new york mannerisms and new york slang speech,positive
the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ,positive
there is no underlying message behind the mans words,positive
the film fails to capture the glory and splendor of christ,positive
had it faithfully explored that aspect than the dichotomy of jesus soul his frailties and doubt mixed with his unmistakable glory would have been simply spectacular,positive
the message of christ is confused between love and violence and the film merely tells us jesus is great instead of showing us his greatness,positive
the film is also overlong,positive
it just drags in the middle with nothing truly happening,positive
christ is a confused figure in the sense that the audience doesnt know who he really is,positive
schrader forgets to give jesus a message to show that he truly is the messiah to give him the divinity,positive
without that he is a rambling prophet who the audience themselves do not believe,positive
there are several moments of accidental hilarity and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach,positive
there are moments of brief awe and power followed by moments of confused hilarity,positive
that said the controversial temptation sequence is something to behold,positive
it is a step in an unexpected direction one that leaves the audience puzzled until the arrival of the disciples,positive
it is a simply breathtaking scene with jesus about to die as a mortal,positive
it is truly one of scorseses finest moments,positive
it is unfortunate that scorsese couldnt make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene,positive
20,positive
the jekyll and hyde story told from his maids point of view is in a word dark,positive
you wouldnt expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevensons novel but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal,positive
john malkovich is terminally depressed and desperate,positive
mary reilly julia roberts is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the antiwoman sentiment of the times,positive
director stephen fears version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them,positive
the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie it almost appears to be filmed in black and white,positive
the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid,positive
scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry,positive
except theres no red of course,positive
the look is so moody and melodramatic that youll be shocked when you leave the theater,positive
i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward,positive
often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts,positive
here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good but certainly powerless,positive
his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience,positive
two parts that make up a whole,positive
neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated disaster is inevitable,positive
the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude,positive
when we finally see the transformation the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction not the psychological horror that the tale demands,positive
roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles,positive
both are suitably melancholy fitting in with the rest of the film,positive
the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close and her lips as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives and surprisingly jekyll apparently frequents,positive
life and color maybe but this is not closes best role,positive
she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character,positive
a beautiful film in its own dreary way,positive
youll appreciate the filmmaking craft but dont expect to leave in an upbeat mood,positive
warning contains what the matrix is,positive
rated r for scifi violence,positive
starring keanu reeves laurence fishburne joe panteliano,positive
some may be disappointed with the matrix,positive
ill tell you i was,positive
i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen,positive
now wait wait i know most of you loved it and im not saying i didnt like it,positive
what im saying is the first half was extremely slow,positive
now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show,positive
dont be fooled this movie has a big story,positive
and big chunks of talky moments,positive
but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par deserving the rating above,positive
ok now to the story,positive
well this may take a while,positive
ok first of all our world we live in now is not the real world actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix,positive
a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world,positive
he does so and finds out that he can do anything be anything he wants to be,positive
but he has to fight a matrix skipping bad guy who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him,positive
laurence fishburne his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves,positive
but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were,positive
yeah there were some in the first half but not enough,positive
the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie,positive
now for the second half it is explosive and saves the movie,positive
some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking,positive
the sound the music and all the effects were effective and the last hour kept us entertained,positive
but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes this movie is at least 40 minutes too long,positive
one would have wished for a better matrix but i do have to say i did like it and i was entertained,positive
along his carreer mel gibson has collected several successes not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view,positive
for all that i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart,positive
the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace a popular scotch hero of the 13th century where he would also perform the principal role,positive
accepting so huge challenge mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years with a suppoosed failure just to see recognized by everyone all his potentialities and that way to consolidate his position in hollywood,positive
it was definitely an enormous risk but im sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face,positive
braveheart is in fact a magnificent and magisterial film,positive
for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narratives rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest,positive
the william wallaces story is the story of so many others brave libertys defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value along the centuries,positive
seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i king of england in a war by the autonomy of scotland,positive
as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up,positive
his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone including the princess isabelle of wales wife of edwards son,positive
however william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought,positive
braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty nowadays,positive
mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast,positive
patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i the king longshank,positive
the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good,positive
sophie marceau as princess isabelle has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart,positive
i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen as robert the bruce and of course mel gibson as william wallace,positive
however i think this time the mel gibsons work as director was much better than his work as actor,positive
the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is,positive
when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes view by the camera of john toll then we realize all the beauty of this film,positive
braveheart is in my opinion one of the best movies of 1995,positive
ive heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean,positive
for now lets see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia,positive
it wont be easy,positive
its gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson,positive
roman emperor marcus aurelius richard harris chooses his trusted general maximus russell crowe as his successor,positive
however the emperors evil son commodus joaquin phoenix murders his father before the announcement can be made and maximus as well as his family is sentenced to be executed,positive
maximus is able to escape his executioners but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo oliver reed,positive
proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money he being a former gladiator himself and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator,positive
when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle,positive
maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus,positive
gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence style of moviemaking,positive
the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used,positive
its choppy slowmotion which is unsettling and distracting,positive
its similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan but nowhere near as effective,positive
the actual gladiator battles are thrilling but also a bit disjointed,positive
many times its unclear as to exactly whats going on,positive
all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled,positive
were not sure whos blood or by whos hand though,positive
theres an instance of this earlier in the film too thats disappointing,positive
its comes when maximus escapes his executioners,positive
some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free,positive
but i still dont know exactly how he did it,positive
russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995s virtuosity,positive
for whatever reason his stardom never arrived,positive
but he should have it now,positive
from here on moviegoers should now be able to say lets go see the new russell crowe movie,positive
he gets the best scene in the film and one of the best moments of all recent movies when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum,positive
its both rousing and chilling,positive
joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character which could have easily happened,positive
commodus is conniving sneaky and whiny but phoenix never lets the character get silly,positive
its a very good and very creepy performance,positive
oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator and its a huge loss to the acting world,positive
ive always been fascinated with reed,positive
hes one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years,positive
its ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again as he gives a fun and sincere performance,positive
the film is dedicated to him and he will surely be missed,positive
reeds death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem as he still had scenes to be completed,positive
rather than recast the role and end up reshooting a great deal of footage a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars,positive
ironically that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film,positive
anyway this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of for about twenty seconds and if you arent looking for it you wont even be able to tell,positive
some of the other digital effects are less convincing however,positive
and like i always say noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately,positive
its sad that such a good film has these distractions,positive
movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects,positive
keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events but is entirely a work of fiction,positive
however its a work of fiction thats great entertainment and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a d,positive
the latest epos from lars is a blast although a rather moody one,positive
this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something,positive
the church calvinistic is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower they are considered being too unrestrained,positive
in these surroundings we find the tobeweds jan and bess played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson,positive
jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess,positive
is just bess a bit naive and innocent in every aspect of the word at first,positive
at the wedding party we are told an anecdote illustrating her infinite kindness she once lend a bike to an stranger her best friends bike however,positive
but bess is suffering in this scary religious society,positive
we soon take part in a funeral where a man fallen off the orthodox path is laid to rest while doomed to hell,positive
women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church,positive
when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend almost manic that her friends try to calm her down a bit,positive
the time has come when jan is to return to the rig bess is falling into the darkness of depression her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves,positive
she cant stand the thought of life without her husband,positive
we witness her dialogues with god she speaks both parts paranoia,positive
convincing god to return jan from the oilrig and her prayers are heard,positive
an accident on the rig bring him back paralysed from the neck and down,positive
now he cant satisfy her need for physical love he try to persuade her into finding a lover with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail,positive
at first she resist but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply,positive
imagine what this is doing to the poor girl,positive
the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby accompanied by music from the era procol harum deep purple trex and others,positive
the use of handheld camera and lack of any makeup make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre,positive
the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant though a bit too gloomy for my taste,positive
i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue 37 2 le matin and bitter moon lunes de fiel,positive
emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances this must be the reason for giving it the grand prix du jury in cannes this year although we had hoped for the palme dor,positive
the screenplay is now available in print the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july just in time for the danish premiere,positive
the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wirefu copycats,positive
its not a pretty death and its leaving the likes of schwartznager stallone and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea,positive
sometimes the mix results in a mindblowing spectacle unlike any other,positive
quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work as in 1999s the matrix can be a real gem,positive
but too often hollywood gets it wrong even when they pay off chinese directors,positive
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists,positive
mostly its laughable,positive
in hollywoods rush to emulate the success of the matrix trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form,positive
but iron monkey the latest asian import shows us how to get it right,positive
iron monkey actually a reissue of a 1993 film is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante rongguang yu fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry,positive
but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong feihong most recently seen in one of the most overlooked and possibly best films of 2000 drunken master 2 released in the u s as the legend of drunken master,positive
unlike drunken master 2 which stars jackie chan as an adult feihong iron monkey finds a much younger feihong szeman tsang and his father wong keiying yen chi dan thrust into the middle of iron monkeys fight against oppression,positive
iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 at times fighting styles especially that of monkey himself do devolve into the ridiculous twinkletoed floating of films like crouching tiger hidden dragon director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth,positive
iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger,positive
however there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his goodhearted but misguided enemy chief fox,positive
in those moments and in others iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience,positive
while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune,positive
aka siunin wong feihung tsi titmalau,positive
denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances,positive
this perhaps may be washingtons very best to date,positive
he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent this season to become his character copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly,positive
his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting the hurricane a much better film than it actually is,positive
when his rubin hurricane carter feels pain and is tormented by racism he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy disgust and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices,positive
the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago,positive
the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone as his tortured carter sum up the troubles of racism in americas history,positive
he is that amazing,positive
the problem with the hurricane is that when compared to washington all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles,positive
mainly because the script focuses so much on carter that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors,positive
this is without a doubt washingtons movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars,positive
denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance,positive
as rubin carter we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system,positive
from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit,positive
then after a successful marriage and boxing career he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder,positive
carters second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous powerful white men who refused to let him succeed,positive
from these past experiences in jail carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america,positive
after several court appeals an autobiography and many public marches for his freedom carter remained locked in prison,positive
it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carters book in the 1980s that a serious battle for freedom took place,positive
the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released,positive
the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation,positive
washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career,positive
the devastation in washingtons eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it,positive
in the hole carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot,positive
his anger is heightened to a point of no control,positive
we see multiple carters a violent angry one a silent passive one and a mediator,positive
we see an emotional boxing match inside carters head,positive
from this point in the hole to the end of the film this fight continues,positive
it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite,positive
when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison the angry carter at first erupts,positive
white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life this reminder leads to anger in his head,positive
however as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him,positive
he realizes that society is changing,positive
that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world,positive
very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here,positive
if only the other actors had this same determination,positive
dan hedaya ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around,positive
it felt like his character was taken straight out of a scooby doo episode he would have gotten away with it if it wasnt for those annoying little kids,positive
the kids in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable,positive
the lawyers who help release carter also are underused as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard the complete opposite of his character in shawshank redemption,positive
there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears,positive
hedaya was superb in clueless same for david paymer in get shorty harris yulin in ghostbusters and liev schreiber in the daytrippers,positive
it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles,positive
on the other hand it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin hurricane carter,positive
this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get,positive
no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan,positive
im referring specifically to the narrative form,positive
in the sweet hereafter egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster,positive
said story of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent british columbia that shatters the morale of the locals is told in a most unstraightforward manner,positive
when the film opens the accident has already happened and stephens the wonderful holm a polite ambulancechaser has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning,positive
throughout we get to meet the parents of the dead broken souls who follow stephens like the pied piper passages of which are read during the film,positive
but there is one living passenger the paralyzed nicole polley whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify,positive
we finally do see the accident about three quarters into the film which is a stunning visual effect,positive
a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding then stopping then collapsing into a frozen lake is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and perhaps ever in a motion picture,positive
the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane traveling to meet his hivpositive runaway daughter as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led preaccident,positive
i have a problem not with the story or story structure but with egoyans heavy handedness behind the camera,positive
for the first hour or so i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears these are miserable miserable people,positive
but thats just the problem so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while when a lot of sadness becomes too much,positive
also a subplot involving incest rings untrue,positive
perhaps it wouldnt feel so contrived if it werent shot in such a tasteful manner,positive
there are two characters who are father and daughter when they first appeared i thought they were lovers,positive
i was halfright,positive
nevertheless its worthseeing,positive
the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that american films are about action canadian films are about consequences hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors including crash and kissed,positive
the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films simply because its not boring or in the case of kissed afraid of its own material necrophilia,positive
egoyan is a fine fine postmodern storyteller whose work is entertaining edgy and smart if a bit too intellectual at times,positive
though i harped on the weightiness of the material i was always absorbed engrossed and surprised by the sweet hereafter,positive
i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan,positive
ive seen some of his films silkwood backdraft unlawful entry and while he gave adequate performances i have never been impressed with his work,positive
breakdown then is something of a surprise,positive
russell gives a fine performance as do most of the cast one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film,positive
to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true but he does it no harm,positive
russell plays jeff one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy kathleen quinlan cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life,positive
while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and left helpless and stranded jeff waves down a passing truck driver j t,positive
walsh who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck,positive
because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help,positive
that it seems is the last time jeff or anyone else sees her,positive
breakdown has been compared to several movies george sluizers the vanishing the original hopefully not his appalling hollywood remake steven spielbergs duel and any number of hitchcock films,positive
as with these breakdown does not for the most part stray down the conventional path of the american actionthriller,positive
jeff does not become a guntoting vigilante on the hunt for his wife but instead becomes a scared confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on,positive
when we do find out what has happened to amy it does come as a slight disappointment if only because its too early in the film i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment but this affects the film little,positive
russell as mentioned earlier is very good in his role and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13,positive
j t,positive
walsh as the possibly evil truck driver is terrific he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesnt seem to know what to do with but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here,positive
the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person one anyone would be able to trust which makes the plot that much more believable,positive
breakdown is what hollywood doesnt make enough of a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do indeed have viewers on the edge of their seats,positive
one of the most genuinely exciting films ive seen in a long time,positive
while alex browning devon sawa waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris bad omens seem to surround him,positive
as soon as he buckles into the plane he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after takeoff,positive
when the vision begins to come true alex bolts for the door dragging several students and a teacher in his wake,positive
the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted,positive
he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die,positive
alex and another survivor clear rivers ali larter investigate the suspicious suicide of a friend and a mortician tony candyman todd clues them in to the truth alex interrupted deaths design by saving people who should have died in the explosion and death will want to claim its rightful victims,positive
in order to save himself and the others alex will have to figure out deaths new plan and thwart it,positive
of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the scream audience final destination is the best so far,positive
talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula,positive
weve seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered onebyone by a faceless slasher but reddick cuts out the hockeymasked middleman and makes the villain death itself,positive
firsttime feature director james wong made the most of that premise,positive
every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding reminding us that death is everywhere can come at anytime,positive
everyday objects and events vibrate with menace,positive
the most amusing harbinger of doom john denvers rocky mountain high which is played several times in the movie before someone dies,positive
the link is that denver died in a plane crash and the song includes a line about fire in the sky,positive
the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror,positive
devon sawa who previously starred in another horror flick idle hands gives a frantic and convincing lead performance,positive
kerr smith is carter hogan an antagonist of alexs whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane,positive
smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence,positive
seann william scott whos also in theaters right now in road trip plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter,positive
tony todds onescene cameo is delicious but all too brief,positive
bottom line watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between but this destination is worth visiting,positive
quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers,positive
after his pulp fiction many actors began receiving many offers for jobs,positive
john travolta made his comeback and is now one of todays most bankable stars,positive
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor,positive
jackie brown on the other hand boasts quite a well known cast except for the main lead pam grier,positive
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films but shes never really had a breakthrough performance her first film was in the roger ebertwritten beyond the valley of the dolls,positive
that is until now,positive
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction,positive
after mediocre acting jobs tarantino returns to what made his name a household one directing and writing,positive
jackie brown is the result and it is fantastic entertainment,positive
despite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steals the film giving one good performance after another,positive
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown and she is supported by an incredible mix of talentsamuel l jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert de niro and robert forster,positive
more than likely you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations,positive
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult as you really cant say much or you spoil it for everyone else,positive
i will tread lightly,positive
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown grier in a blue outfit walking through the airport,positive
the camera tracks along with her and ends up revealing her occupation,positive
we are also introduced to ordell robbie jackson who sells illegal guns to interested buyers,positive
for a hefty price,positive
ms brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away,positive
however an fbi agent keaton and a local l a cop michael bowen are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money,positive
they try to reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one of ordells buyers but he mysteriously ends up dead,positive
they try again through brown but she is hesitant to admit to any wrongdoing,positive
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordells friends fonda she is caught and sent to jail,positive
ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent max cherry forster and then wants to find out what she told the cops,positive
after she claims to have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison,positive
ordell doesnt like this but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track,positive
this scheme seems to be going as planned but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal,positive
revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown and thats the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film,positive
tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments and slang terms but they are always done very well and believably,positive
his hitmen are normally cruel but pleasant in that nasty sort of way,positive
they talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude to their girlfriends,positive
of course this is a tarantino film and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise,positive
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop,positive
of course tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film adding a lot of his reservoir dogsstyle storytelling to it,positive
things are told from one persons perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more,positive
this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion which decides who is on whose side,positive
on the technical side of jackie brown quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film,positive
however this time around it isnt as nearly as impressive or original,positive
the writing on the other hand is quite good although i do find tarantinos use of slang terms offensive,positive
the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction but its much more easy to understand,positive
his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation but jackie brown is very simply to follow especially considering that the time is given during the leaps in time,positive
perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch by elmore leonard,positive
the dialogue is pretty much intelligent and all the characters are fully realized,positive
the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro who has worked with tarantino on previous films and the editing is very good,positive
and as with pulp fiction the music is a highlight bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s,positive
the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable,positive
the performances are incredibly rich with hidden meaning behind every characters actions,positive
nothing is quite as it seems and you cant really tell which side one person is on,positive
the real treat of course is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown,positive
her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits which play an important role in the film,positive
watching grieg i could tell what was going through her mind even if i didnt know what she was thinking,positive
her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad happy or in deep thought,positive
bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato,positive
i didnt even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits her performance actually reminded me of heather grahams in boogie nights,positive
michael keaton comes across very well as does michael bowen,positive
chris tucker has a small but effective performance,positive
samuel l jackson is very good but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much less cynical,positive
but no matter,positive
jackson is very strong in his role,positive
robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times but overall he does a good job as one of ordells perspective clients and friends,positive
robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film as he has one of the most developed characters,positive
he is present throughout most of the film and he holds his own against jackson and grier,positive
jackie brown is rated r for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remarks,positive
as a film by itself jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment with a complex plot to draw viewers in,positive
however one can not help but compare it to tarantinos pulp fiction and expect great results,positive
when compared it comes up short but not that short,positive
its a worthy effort with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino,positive
perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress,positive
i cant remember seeing her in anything except for a small role in mars attacks but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one,positive
expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations and hopefully she will even be able to nab one,positive
dora fernanda montenegro sits behind a makeshift desk at rios major train station,positive
she in her colorful demeanor offers a service that is unheard of in the states,positive
she writes letters for the illiterate who pass through to try to find lost relatives find love or search after lost debts,positive
shes quirky shes elderly shes caring,positive
totally trustworthy right,positive
not a chance,positive
once home she never sends these letters saving money on postage and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene mar lia p ra,positive
one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nineyear old son looking for their father,positive
shortly thereafter she gets hit by a bus and the son is orphaned,positive
days go by and the boy named josu roams around the station hungry desperate and somewhat clueless to his predictament,positive
through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu s father,positive
this means leaving the security of rio traveling to the outskirts of brazil where unpaved roads religious devotees and the povertystricken become commonplace,positive
films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films,positive
it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world so distant from my own,positive
it does so entertainingly and so heartwrenchingly,positive
and yet its backdrop is merely that,positive
the focus is on the minute transformation of dora of how she learns to love this little kid without being cloying or sentimental,positive
the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film,positive
dora being an amoral scamartist could care less about the amount of bickering between the candlelighting of the catholics versus the bumpersticker mentality of the evangelicals,positive
but neither side is trivialized,positive
she even begins to develop an affection for a nondrinking evangelical who sees the problems with dora if not initially,positive
fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira who plays josu,positive
he like the discoveries of j r mie renier la promesse and giorgio cantarini life is beautiful prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states,positive
he is a natural and never once grating,positive
send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas,positive
the farrelly brothers third film after dumb and dumber 7 510 and kingpin 810 brings together the reallife couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon some nasty humour a cute dog and a mix of love fate and romance,positive
plot highschool nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom,positive
unfortunately for ted he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ouch,positive
caught in his zipper and misses the big night,positive
thirteen years later ted still cant get mary out of his mind and hires a private detective dillon to find her,positive
once found it turns out that mary has more than one suitor and thats when the real fun begins,positive
critique likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes some funny looking people and a plot that wont ever put you to sleep,positive
having said that i must admit that i did like the farrellys two previous films more than this one but that is saying a lot since i really did love those earlier pics,positive
this one is also quite funny but it didnt really blow me away like the others,positive
then again maybe my expectations were too high,positive
then again maybe i should shut up and write a little more about the film and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for the film,positive
continuing where their other pictures left off the farrellys create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities and a simple plot by which to tie them all together,positive
this one also includes plenty of toilet humour but also some borderline funmaking of the disabled and mentallychallenged,positive
i must admit that i really wasnt sure whether to laugh at some points or not,positive
not a good place to be,positive
having said that the scenes that did tear through the audience and yours truly were extremely hilarious and went on for several minutes after the punchline,positive
the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie something to do with hair gel,positive
on the negative end i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture,positive
i found them quite useless unfunny and distracting,positive
also i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the films trailer,positive
and of course i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful intelligent single women still cant seem to find the right guy see kiss the girls 710,positive
i did really like all of the actors in the film especially ben stiller who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 flirting with disaster 810,positive
i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth and lee evans with his superb fauxsympathy british accent,positive
funny stuff,positive
also make sure that you stay for the credits because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lipsynched version of build me up buttercup which is really cool,positive
overall a cute comedy with a decent premise and a few particularly hilarious scenes,positive
little known facts the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script dust to dust into the hands of eddie murphy via murphys neighbour,positive
they only found out about murphys interest when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night,positive
matt dillon is a high school dropout,positive
in between acting gigs dillon has branched out into the restaurant business,positive
close to home in his native new york he coowns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls,positive
cameron diaz stands 5 9 started working as a model at the early age of 16 and loves cats,positive
ben stillers father is jerry stiller,positive
he played george costanzas jason alexander father on tvs seinfeld,positive
peter farrelly has written a novel entitled outside providence which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin,positive
rob moran who plays the cop in this film also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin and the bartender in dumb and dumber,positive
he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college and is currently married to entertainment tonight julie moran,positive
harland williams who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film also played a state trooper in the farrellys earlier dumb and dumber and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man,positive
earlier this year the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics,positive
a real charmer of a movie its possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience,positive
now at the end of 1998 comes waking ned devine a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter,positive
theres no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere they strike all the same chords but still ned devine is a movie worth seeing,positive
the plot is interesting and robust the latest lottery winner is ned devine jimmy keogh of tullymore ireland,positive
neds prize is over six million pounds but the shock of winning killed the poor old man and the check remains unclaimed,positive
enter jackie oshea ian bannen and michael osullivan david kelly the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village,positive
the two men eventually find the ticket and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that hes actually ned the entire town can reap the benefits their only adversary is an ancient old woman eileen dromey who sees more profit in reporting the fraud,positive
ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael,positive
jackie stocky and large is the brains behind the operation michael scrawny and short is the method man,positive
the two contrast each other delightfully and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience,positive
every viewer is sure to like both of them,positive
there are other minor subplots included as well such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer,positive
this appears quite inconsequential until the end and even with a startling revelation its a tad bit unnecessary,positive
overall waking ned devine has a predictable outcome and plot twists are never really taken seriously,positive
the ending a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout,positive
the kirk jones script is indeed offthecuff,positive
in a way waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents warm friendly outgoing and jovial,positive
its the perfect kind of comedy a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes,positive
theres nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one,positive
indeed its one of the years best feelgood movies 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss,positive
it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festivals palme dor a 100 millionplus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction,positive
since then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as a codirector of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampirefest from dusk till dawn,positive
in between he has moonlighted as an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performances,positive
now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown,positive
and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonards novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed,positive
for the most part jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie,positive
the story which starts out slowly develops into a twisty affair with doublecrosses and triplecrosses,positive
and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire 70s pop tunes and closeups of womens bare feet,positive
yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown,positive
the sheer inyourface exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent,positive
the mostlystraightforward chronology of jackie brown doesnt match up favorably to the nonlinear style of tarantinos previous efforts an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives,positive
and there arent nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around,positive
theres a samuel l jackson monologue about guns a tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk and a de niro exchange that recalls some of the material from pulp fiction but thats about it,positive
jackie browns lone innovation is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives,positive
this isnt exactly an original technique it has been done numerous times before most famously in akira kurosawas rashomon and most recently in edward zwicks courage under fire,positive
however while in those two movies and others there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple pointsof view tarantinos sole purpose for using it appears to be because its unconventional,positive
had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost,positive
as a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity,positive
for the second picture in a row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a 70s icon,positive
this time around instead of john travolta its blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown,positive
in one of many nods to the most famous segment of griers career tarantino uses a 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits,positive
there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any buttkicking,positive
grier is jackie brown a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states,positive
shes working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel l jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton a federal official,positive
no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for a bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tvs banyon to post the necessary 10 000 then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal,positive
jackie passes ordells test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle 500 000 of ordells money into the united states without tipping off the feds,positive
soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordells perpetually oversexed and druggedout girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his righthand man louis robert de niro,positive
unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l jackson but ordell isnt nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction,positive
in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get a nomination,positive
robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their toughguyswhorarely smile roles,positive
bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantinos foot fetish,positive
robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middleaged actor,positive
the film which clocks in at several minutes over the twoanda half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout although the payoff is a letdown,positive
tarantino keeps things moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself,positive
when it comes to recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown is a secondtier effort,positive
its an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender,positive
with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up loading their guns kissing each other and uttering what sounds like rock and roll,positive
actually its lock and load you cant help thinking tarantino,positive
and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie clyde to natural born killers,positive
but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon,positive
inspired by true events weve heard that one before and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated,positive
or so strangely poignant,positive
for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged,positive
beginning with their final arrest the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris luke perry a policeman and pam ashley judd a factory worker,positive
they fall in love and marry but pams increasingly erratic behaviour going on spending sprees slashing herself with a knife after an argument begin to trouble the solid and stable chris,positive
when chris gets sacked they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up,positive
then chris begins to rob banks,positive
luke perry accomplishes the notinconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer,positive
moustached with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation he is perfectly cast as the longsuffering husband,positive
its another of john mcnaughtons coups of castingagainsttype after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory,positive
but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person,positive
if the performance falls short of greatness however it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema whether its in betty blue tom viv or georgia,positive
as in those movies theres the danger that the performance seems mannered a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece,positive
judd doesnt entirely avoid this pitfall but pams craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more normal chris,positive
when pam reacts to her fatherinlaws death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones chris face is the picture of pained restraint,positive
of course its the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life,positive
mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity,positive
it is the rational chris that loves guns shooting is about precision control and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog who is then called chaos chaos and you and me,positive
were a real family she notes wryly,positive
it is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber his wellplanned disguise as a bearded roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness,positive
in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background buymore the perfectly respectable consumptioncrazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases and both of them into desperate situations,positive
its not a perfect film,positive
some of the dialogue is a touch too banal perhaps intentionally,positive
the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pams crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film,positive
indeed as in mcnaughtons seminal film henry portrait of a serial killer it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre that gives this determinedly unflashy moving film its great strengths,positive
mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer,positive
the suburbs with their miles of whitefenced houses and identikit malls take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness,positive
in its very different way this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malicks badlands,positive
while pam shares the yearnings of malicks heroes to escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies,positive
but these are dreams defined by constrained by and even doomed by the limitations of the normal conventional world,positive
pams final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer limits of her society but also quite literally the end of the road where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement,positive
the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video,positive
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,positive
pretty good bring a friend,positive
amazing potent stuff,positive
perfection,positive
see it twice,positive
whenever robert altman works in a specific genre he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms,positive
he made the west dirty in mccabe and mrs miller 1971 he parodied hardboiled detective stories in the long goodbye 1973 and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with popeye 1980,positive
the same holds true for his most recent film the gingerbread man which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years the john grisham movie,positive
by the time the gingerbread man was completed there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham,positive
theres no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise matthew mcconaughey chris odonnell or matt damon and it doesnt feature a great showdown in a courtroom,positive
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession the gingerbread man is a rainsoaked southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters a twisting plot line black humor a somewhat bleak ending and even altmans trademark fullfrontal female nudity,positive
the central character of the film is rick magruder who is unlike any of grishams other lawyer heroes,positive
he is older experienced and rich he drives a cherryred 80 000 mercedes that never gets dirty even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah georgia where the story unfolds,positive
rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife leeanne famke janssen and he rarely gets to see his two children jeff jesse james and libby mae whitman,positive
a reason is never given for the divorce but it isnt hard to surmise that ricks womanizing had a large part in it,positive
whenever hes late to pick up the kids on his visitation days leeanne always assumes its because hes been screwing around,positive
after an office party celebrating another of his court victories he hasnt lost in eight years rick becomes involved with mallory doss embeth davidtz one of the catering waitresses,positive
he drives her home because her car has been stolen and they end up in bed together,positive
rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father dixon doss robert duvall a grungy stringy barefooted old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers,positive
it was actually dixon who stole her car that night and when rick asks why mallory replies that he always does weird stuff like that,positive
as another character puts it dixon is a few beers short of sixpack,positive
rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency,positive
he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell a private investigator friend robert downey jr and testimony from mallorys begrudging exhusband pete randle tom berenger,positive
dixon is put in a mental hospital but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out,positive
from there the story delves into kidnapping murder doublecrossing and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action,positive
altmans cinematographer changwei gu gives the film a dark soaked look,positive
if it isnt nighttime at least its raining,positive
gu shoots the interiors which are almost all dark wood paneling with a minimum of light,positive
a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability,positive
in the city there is danger enough but when rick has to venture into the woods you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world,positive
altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre from westerns to epic dramas to comedies,positive
but no matter what the genre he is always sure to give it the altman stamp which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings,positive
the gingerbread man is no different although his style is much more restrained here,positive
however without those little touches the film could have easily slumped into a routine,positive
a great deal of the credit for the films success can be given to the actors especially branagh who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction,positive
here the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic,positive
rick is an extremely flawed man but branaugh brings real humanity to his character,positive
without it the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling ricks pain and frustration,positive
the supporting actors also put in fine performances including embeth davidtz who is probably best known for her heartbreaking role as the jewish maid in schindlers list 1993,positive
tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief and robert duvall spends most of his onscreen time just looking weird,positive
it doesnt seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue but watch him closely during the films one courtroom scene his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing,positive
while the gingerbread man isnt in league with altmans greatest works like nashville 1975 or the player 1992 it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career,positive
some critics love to stamp films like this as commercial as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and dont make money,positive
altman has done something much better he took what could have been a generic movie and by investing artistry and effort he made it into something more,positive
it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste,positive
indeed,positive
while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungeejumping they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration,positive
i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool this movie creeps up on youat a slow 139 minutes i mean creepsand despite the final shots ambiguity i left completely satisfied,positive
henry fool used to have an e arrives at garbageman simon grims house claims the vacant basement apartment and almost instantly inspires simon urbaniak to take up writinghenry martin donovan lookalike ryan is an exconvict a oncegreat author who has been exiled and marginalized by the publishing community because of his criminal activity,positive
simons poetry turns him into a local sensation as it causes mute women to sing highschool girls to swoon and councilmen to rile against its pornographic content,positive
meanwhile henry seduces both simons dependent mother porter and immature sister sundance queen posey with philosophical babble which is by turns brilliant and inane and breathy animal lust,positive
these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable the teacherstudent relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself,positive
henry fool is sprinkled with hartleyian flourishes simon drinks milk from udderleys the big teen hangout is called world of donuts simon wears his garbagemans uniform throughout the editing style is decidedly elliptical,positive
which is key to the conclusions said ambiguity,positive
the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first selfconsciously quirky the introductory scenes are a chore,positive
these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion a belief in themselves and because they have longterm goals henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner but they arent pop slackers,positive
the story is rather classical the tutor is a better talker than a doer raised on books the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of,positive
shades of film school,positive
the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small and the final third does test ones patience yet henry fool is tight hardly excessive in its length,positive
how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character,positive
and unless i nodded off not a single building exploded,positive
this hartleys seventh feature is contemplative about the artist fortunately we never get a sampling of simons work and its a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers pens,positive
jamaica is a hot vacation spot,positive
the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american the sea is a brilliant blue the air is warm but lacks humidity,positive
and as tourism is unfortunately jamaicas biggest trade foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation,positive
life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country,positive
while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface,positive
the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid,positive
it guides the audience along a tourists journey and the story of the native inhabitants,positive
instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen it quips you dont see what happens after you flush the toilet,positive
this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there,positive
this strong sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film,positive
stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals,positive
this isnt just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life,positive
people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation from field to factory as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country,positive
the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not,positive
of course as can be expected the united states is slammed owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank,positive
officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaicas economy will help the country back on its feet but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word,positive
the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u s is forcing on the citizens,positive
admittedly some of the back and forth between the businessminded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument,positive
but jamaica isnt against the united states and this documentary does not accuse the u s of being the sole perpetrator of its grief,positive
if anything it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations,positive
ill be the first to admit i didnt expect much from the emperors new groove more celine dionesque songanddance numbers cuddly characters that become crosspromotion devices in mcdonalds happy meals and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voiceover job to their resume,positive
i was dead wrong about all of those things,positive
the emperors new groove is funny,positive
damn funny,positive
and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones,positive
the script is fast and furious with no singing and dancing,positive
the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over,positive
the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us,positive
the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking crossdressing llamas and schizophrenia,positive
heres the plot try to follow along,positive
set in a mythical kingdom the film follows the adventures of kuzco david spade an arrogant and egocentric emperor,positive
when kuzco fires his powerhungry advisor yzma eartha kitt she and her assistant kronk seinfelds patrick warburton change him into a llama,positive
kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha john goodman a llamaherder whose home was to be replaced by kuzcos water world theme park to save him,positive
then the fun starts,positive
for the next sixty minutes the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days imagination,positive
yzma voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt looks like a cross between norma desmond joan crawford and a really old vegas showgirl,positive
the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick sharp and feels like an episode of seinfeld which would make sense,positive
david spade and john goodmans character interactions make you feel like youre watching an old film,positive
spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions and i laughed out loud several times,positive
needless to say that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days,positive
the best part about the emperors new groove is how audacious the film is,positive
the sheer weirdness factor is very high,positive
crossdressing schizophrenia duality of soul people being turned into every animal on noahs boat llama cpr homoerotic tendencies an emperor with his own theme song and singer michael jackson dance moves and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal,positive
simply put the emperors new groove is one of the best childrens films out for this holiday season,positive
kids will enjoy the adventures and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue,positive
thats a tough thing to pull off in a single package but this emperor manages to do it,positive
some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen,positive
i finished mike figgis leaving las vegas hours ago and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr,positive
alot of people refer to this film as that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude,positive
leaving las vegas is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are a drunk and a whore,positive
ben nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years is the drunk,positive
his family and friends have long since abandon him and all he has left is his liquor,positive
in a scene early in the film we see ben staggering into a resteraunt looking for a friend of his to mooch some money off of,positive
he finds the guy richard lewis having dinner with a buddy and two chicks trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid,positive
when ben approaches the table you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable,positive
after lewis gives ben the money he coldly says i think it would be best if you didnt contact me again,positive
now even though through the course of the film some much more depressing things happen this is when i felt the most for ben,positive
there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face not to sound hokey or anything it almost brought a tear to my eye,positive
it turns out that ben was once a semisuccessful hollywood player and apparently a pretty popular guy,positive
now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women not so much for the sex but for the company for someone to talk to or spend time with,positive
once he is fired from his job ben decides to burn all his belongings collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death,positive
one night he runs into a prostitute a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue how far she has come since adventures in babysitting named sera,positive
she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp a scumbag who getsoff by cutting her,positive
they are both very lonely selfdestructive people,positive
they immediatly hit it off both of them realizing that they need one another,positive
and it isnt even a sexual relationship,positive
they dont even have sex until like the last ten minutes of the film,positive
leaving las vegas is not a film about plot,positive
with the exception of what i have already revealed which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so by the way there isnt too much of a story to it,positive
it is more a film about people and how they react to one another,positive
from what i can see this is basically a perfect film,positive
the direction is great with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody smokey atmosphere of a film noir and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s or any other decade for that matter,positive
but dont go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what youre getting yourself into,positive
first off if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge stay away from leaving las vegas,positive
it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon thats right,positive
secondly if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film dont see it,positive
however if you are cool with those two things you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have,positive
though it is a fine piece of filmmaking theres something about elizabeth that,positive
left me a bit cold and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films particularly these days i just didnt care about the characters,positive
to me the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters be they imagined or historical as the case may be that the audience gives a hoot about,positive
and though elizabeth works well on many levels it falls short of excellence because of that very reason,positive
elizabeth takes place in england in 1554 as queen mary half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying,positive
before she dies though she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs,positive
as a result amidst much anger within the council elizabeth becomes the queen of england,positive
the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life,positive
much of the film deals with elizabeths love for lord robert a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen,positive
there is much ado about her lack of a husband and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation,positive
the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece as love interests are such a character driven element,positive
i didnt much care about the characters perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett and so i didnt have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials,positive
the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queens most loyal advisor sir francis and attenborough as a wellmeaning but oldfashioned lead council,positive
why then you must be asking do i recommend elizabeth,positive
simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer,positive
kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin neither of whom i have heard create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side,positive
the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches cellars and castles in 16th century europe,positive
each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blownout white light from windows,positive
the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot,positive
indeed elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade ranking with kundun and braveheart,positive
watch also for the incredibly godfatheresque mass murder scene,positive
it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films,positive
on rewatching italian dario argentos much lauded murder mystery tenebrae i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with,positive
in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his giallo murder mysteries,positive
while its certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller,positive
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book tenebrae,positive
with the police on his back for leads he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems,positive
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa,positive
he brings grace charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding reallife horror around him,positive
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension,positive
argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business,positive
tenebrae is perhaps the most multilayered of argentos scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here,positive
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play,positive
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep rosso the fulllength italian language version and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes,positive
needless to say for argento fans there is no denying the directors brilliance as a stylist,positive
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork,positive
they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria,positive
instead tenebraes set design and lighting paints a sleek clinical chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world,positive
and the soundtracks mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment,positive
so tenebrae has much to recommend it no question,positive
still constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative,positive
some critics argue that logic doesnt matter in argento films but damnit it matters in all films to the point where viewers dont deserve to feel cheated,positive
by the way if you dont want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs,positive
about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which properly handled could have proved ingenious,positive
we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who we later discover is none other than the author peter neal,positive
he is insane apparently,positive
the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides its time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife,positive
he is finally revealed to us as this second killer in the films bloody climax,positive
but argento muffs the twist both technically and narratively,positive
you see we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killers house,positive
but thanks to poor editing its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway,positive
bad cutting puts the timing way out,positive
in other words hes almost in two places at once,positive
during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring,positive
by the films end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have selfinflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant,positive
the injury,positive
he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock,positive
thus the revelation of the hero as a killer and antihero in the final scenes may still prove shocking but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled,positive
helpfully in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along,positive
but there too is a problem as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least,positive
the story owes us a better understanding of franciosas mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage,positive
tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies,positive
for instance a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike,positive
we would assume the rider is the same boy but it turns out to be some male character we arent even introduced too,positive
thats careless filmmaking pure and simple,positive
why you may ask do i go on about the storys flaws,positive
because when it comes to visuals and set pieces argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world,positive
take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae,positive
an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where almost unbelievably it jumps a high fence and chases her across town,positive
finally as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumbles on the serial killers lair,positive
its an absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone,positive
and thats exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating,positive
too often it seems argentos films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts,positive
mind you if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look,positive
and if youre a fan of argentos unique style of giallo thriller then its essential,positive
see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli,positive
its a stylish greatlooking and quirky film despite the problem narrative,positive
a shame because it doesnt have to be that way,positive
take argentos more recent stendhal syndrome 1992 where with the aid of cowriter franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache,positive
proof that he can do it if he tries,positive
after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project making the third installment in the godfathertrilogy,positive
this new film has been underrated for no reason,positive
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copollas pervious films,positive
it is also more psychological pessimistic and more tragic than the first two,positive
the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some unfinished developments of some characters,positive
the film elegantly begins with nino rotas recognizable musical score the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michaels voice as he is writing a letter to his children the only wealth in this world is children,positive
more than all money and power on earth you are my treasure,positive
the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of part ii to make his fathers dream come true making the corleone family legitimate,positive
michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling,positive
constantly haunted by the past his only reason to live is his children,positive
the family has amassed unimaginable wealth and as the film opens michael corleone al pacino is being invested with a great honor by the church,positive
later that day at a reception his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily a check in the amount of 100 million,positive
but the corleones are about to find as others have throughout history that you cannot buy forgiveness,positive
sure you can do business with evil men inside the church for all men are fallible and capable of sin,positive
but god does not take payoffs,positive
the plot of the movie concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican,positive
there is a moment in godfather iii where michael says all my life i have been trying to go up in society where everything was legal,positive
but the higher i go the crookier it becomes,positive
visually this film is as spectacular as the first two,positive
gordon willis rich cinematography carmine copollas beautiful composition and alex tavoularis wonderful art direction could not be better,positive
but copollas first two godfatherfilms were more famous for their deep intellectual plots tree dimensional characters and incredible acting than for their visual perfection,positive
the third installment has only the plot and visuals,positive
some characters could be much more developed and the acting although good never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films,positive
the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie that could have been grander and more emotional,positive
the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars,positive
andy garcia is powerful as sonnys son strong focused and loyal,positive
violence is natural to him,positive
he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his familys behalf and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was,positive
however both kay diane keaton and connie talia shire are useless,positive
and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed,positive
the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends that you remember from the first and second films,positive
in the third film michael has become almost like his father vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger,positive
this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzos character was more developed,positive
many have pointed out that making the third film was unnecessary,positive
i disagree,positive
it is a beautiful film of great importance completing the tragic saga of the corleone family,positive
the first film showed some horrible results of corleones life,positive
it showed michael making a choice the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times,positive
a man desperately trying to keep his balance focus family and sanity while everything is crashing all around him,positive
the third film is a terrifying conclusion a result of michaels life,positive
the life he chose for himself is like quicksand one wrong step and you are doomed,positive
there is no turning back,positive
and no matter how hard you try to get out of it to free yourself no matter how powerful and wealthy you are you are helpless sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely,positive
the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film when michael is sitting alone in his chair left by everyone surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead,positive
here he dies alone miserable and unforgiven,positive
since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller blood simple joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic original and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood,positive
their films are highly stylized deeply embedded in a particular time and place and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances,positive
in the big lebowski their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy awardwinning fargo the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski aka the dude,positive
the dude is played by jeff bridges one of hollywoods most underrated actors in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high,positive
the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties,positive
he has shaggy shoulderlength hair a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim and he wears mostly stained teeshirts long shorts and gellies without socks,positive
he smokes a lot of pot drinks a lot of white russians and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak john goodman and donny steve buscemi one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation but never quite makes it in,positive
one day the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski david huddleston this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife bunny tara reid owes a lot of people a lot of money,positive
the main plot and all its accompanying sideplots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here,positive
suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money,positive
by the time all is said and done walter has become deeply involved as has the big lebowskis daughter maude julianne moore a feminist performance artist a pornographer named jackie treehorn ben gazzara and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in fargo,positive
the big lebowski plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers earlier efforts,positive
it shares their previous films strong sense of time and place as well as their sendups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies,positive
lebowski has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made raising arizona such a hoot it has surrealistic dream sequences one of which involves a busby berkleylike dance number that characterized the ending of barton fink and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded the hudsucker proxy,positive
the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins who has worked with the coens on three other films barton fink the hudsucker proxy and fargo,positive
deakins always gives the coens films a distinctive visual style and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dudes main competitor jesus quintana john turturro or the strikingly manic dream sequences one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling balls point of view,positive
if fargo was the coen brothers most restrained effort in years the big lebowski marks their return to overtheedge filmmaking,positive
it is overflowing with style and attitude which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end,positive
the coens fill the screen with lighting set design music and hilarious performances from all the leads especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman who shows real comic timing in his untimely naminspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism,positive
with joel directing ethan producing and both writing the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out,positive
their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light,positive
the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world and they put them centerstage to show that its not just guys like the dude who are nuts but the entire planet,positive
jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation,positive
even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation,positive
this is after all the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction,positive
to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio desperado four rooms and from dusk til dawn,positive
he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide,positive
im willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him,positive
tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films but never took the directors helm,positive
nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more tarantino returns with a film he can call his own,positive
the film opens up with an homage to the graduate with jackie brown pam grier on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her,positive
jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas,positive
this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel l jackson who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico,positive
however while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u s for ordell jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only with the money but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs,positive
jackie didnt know they were in the package with the cash but thats of no consequence to the authorities who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted,positive
of course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish ordell,positive
ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster to get jackie out of jail but while max is immediately attracted to her jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police,positive
sure enough ordell shows up at jackies apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good but she borrows maxs pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell,positive
instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistols chamber to ordells head jackie proposes a deal,positive
since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more but this time for a more substantial fee fifteen percent of ordells half million dollars,positive
with a gun in his face how can ordell not agree,positive
by itself this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film,positive
however we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think,positive
jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell but shes also making a deal with the feds as well as with max,positive
the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around,positive
instead its actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of todays movies,positive
at least this film has a little imagination,positive
most of the performances in jackie brown are above par,positive
pam grier of whom i had never taken notice before plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable,positive
samuel l jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control,positive
robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy trying to do his best,positive
never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guys apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course,positive
hes just so downtoearth the nature of his job really doesnt occur to us even when were shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison or when we see the tools of his trade,positive
in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara a recently paroled friend of ordells and bridget fonda as melanie one of the girls ordell keeps around town,positive
unfortunately de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentences,positive
in this film hes not really de niro but stereotypical de niro uttering things like little bit and pretty much,positive
fonda on the other hand plays the slightly spacedout melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she is annoying louis we are taking her side,positive
as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand the dialog is quick and snappy,positive
it grabs our attention and is actually interesting and in many respects this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves,positive
dont count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera however,positive
theres a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange and hes not really sure whats happening but by composing the scene just so his realization of whats going on is felt simultaneously by the audience,positive
we look at the screen and think gee thats clever and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on,positive
although tarantino isnt afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film,positive
there are shots where a character is simply driving and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head,positive
this is a tribute to both direction and acting,positive
however there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall and she is looking for something desperately looking for something,positive
we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what shes looking for but instead hoping shell just stop,positive
overall viewing jackie brown is time spent well,positive
some flap has already been made about the language used in the film but its really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today,positive
in fact one might even be able to say that the way in which these offensive words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness,positive
go see the film and see what i mean,positive
robert redfords a river runs through it is not a film i watch often,positive
it is a masterpiece one of the better films of recent years,positive
until 1994 it was my second favorite film of all time,positive
the acting and direction is topnotch never sappy always touching,positive
a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because i was afraid it would just be really politically correct and tick me off,positive
all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased and enjoy,positive
it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears,positive
but certain memories should not often be rereleased in the last few shots you have to cry,positive
upon my first viewing i left bawling,positive
it is not flawless but it is so very good that you cant help but be effected,positive
the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental watching these shots of people who have been dead so long gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films,positive
martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state like taking dope and immersing yourself in an alternative world,positive
that is what a river runs through it does,positive
it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self,positive
both times ive seen it its been hard again to quote scorsese waking up,positive
but the dream is lovely,positive
kolya is one of the richest films ive seen in some time,positive
zdenek sverak plays a confirmed old bachelor whos likely to remain so who finds his life as a czech cellist increasingly impacted by the fiveyear old boy that hes taking care of,positive
though it ends rather abruptly and im whining cause i wanted to spend more time with these characters the acting writing and production values are as high as if not higher than comparable american dramas,positive
this fatherandson delight sverak also wrote the script while his son jan directed won a golden globe for best foreign language film and a couple days after i saw it walked away an oscar,positive
in czech and russian with english subtitles,positive
after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction jackie brown seems like something of a lighthearted departure for quentin tarantino,positive
its more of a hohum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language,positive
luckily his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer,positive
the story introduces us to a streetwise black woman named jackie brown pam grier a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another,positive
she works for a bottomofthebarrel airline and receives a minimal salary,positive
but one day she is picked up by a pair of federal officials including michael keaton as the toughnosed ray nicolet and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope,positive
jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell samuel l jackson who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation,positive
soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle 500 000 through to them under nicolets nose with the help of ordells oaf of a partner robert de niro and druggedout lady friend bridget fonda,positive
also entering the picture is a bailbondsman named max cherry robert forster who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated how i wont say,positive
the big dropoff is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown in which numerous doublecrosses take place and many clothing store bags filled with cash switch hands,positive
its unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there and doesnt offer anything extremely compelling while doing so,positive
there are as always amusing exchanges between characters,positive
the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq or lack thereof,positive
the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie,positive
a 56year old white bail bondsman and a 44year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry,positive
youve got to commend the acting,positive
jackie brown is a seriously draggedout exercise enlivened by such fine acting,positive
the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours 35 minutes,positive
tarantinos talky style manages to hold your attention heavily but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline,positive
also fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear,positive
jackie brown has four major shootings and two of those take place mostly offscreen so dont be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath,positive
you can expect frequent foul language mostly coming way of ordell who much to the dismay of spike lee uses the n word as part of his regular vocabulary,positive
the acting is the glue that holds everything together,positive
grier making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970s is more than adequate for the title character,positive
in fact shes flatout great,positive
another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster who does a grand job as max cherry and is perfectly cast in doing so,positive
michael keaton makes his presence felt albeit in small but dignified moments and de niro is ideal in playing the lughead who goes over the edge,positive
speaking of that bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordells bikiniclad beach babe and yet she manages to look fairly occupied,positive
theres not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie,positive
which is a lifesaver for mr tarantino,positive
the story barely holds together in the meantime and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake,positive
but oh well,positive
jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work,positive
lets just hope that the director hasnt gone soft on us,positive
contact is the 1997 movie ive seen the most five times to be exact,positive
four of those times were on the big screen but even on a tv its a very impressive film,positive
the same cant be said for films like independance day but thats because contact is a rare example in scifi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects and all of us know looking back that id4 didnt offer much outside of some onetime delightful eye candy,positive
contacts wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway jodie foster a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of merely listening to sounds out in space,positive
her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age encouraged by her loving father ted david morse who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola fl that was of course before the days of internet chat rooms,positive
while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence of which the program seti is an acronym for ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive,positive
ellies strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young,positive
in puerto rico she meets palmer joss matthew mcconaughey a writer examining the effects of technology on the worlds overall happiness a one time seminary student who describes himself as a man of the cloth without the cloth,positive
despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a supreme being ellie and palmer hit it off and even take the time to sleep together,positive
its a weak and hurried relationship but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on,positive
meanwhile dr david drumlin tom skerritt who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding,positive
this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation and only a one night stand to remember,positive
it is in this nm city where several months later ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science,positive
when the signal is closely examined many new developments spring up and before long drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at,positive
eventually it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega where the signal seems to have originated,positive
the media swarms fanatics go further off the deep end scientists clamor for new information politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality remember when zemeckis couldnt get enough of this in forrest gump,positive
as if that werent enough ellies discovery leads her to the nations capital where she again runs into palmer,positive
contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs religion,positive
the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented with no signs of bias,positive
arguments for both sides are intelligent solid and thoughtprovoking,positive
when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega of which ellie is a leading candidate personal convictions play a more important role than love interests,positive
the question is can a person who doesnt believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90 of the planet does believe in a higher power,positive
even when the film wraps up its uncertain whether its meant to play as an advocate for religion science both or even neither and in our modern day society where right and wrong is only opinion at least speaking politically correctly the ambiguity is an incentive,positive
dont get me wrong,positive
as much as it sounds like it contact isnt merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film,positive
its a highly enjoyable two and a half hours,positive
despite its seemingly heavy issues its not a tedious undertaking to watch this film,positive
the special effects are outstanding though warning,positive
highly depreciated on the small screen,positive
even so some of the subtle visual effects that will likely go unnoticed by many are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as scifi,positive
the storytelling is rich and complete and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious and at times even hokey its easily one of the best 1997 films and one of the best scifi films ive ever seen,positive
this is zemeckis best since back to the future and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated zemeckis now has real reason to boast,positive
ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan,positive
you remember he was the title character in that 70s sitcom welcome back kotter,positive
always trying to help out the sweathogs frequently trying to dodge mr woodman ever wary of his wifes tuna casserole,positive
so you ask where is he now,positive
mr kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional highstakes poker,positive
thats right,positive
im not sure if its his main source of income but from what ive heard the guy occasionally comes away with 20 000 at a time,positive
and there you were thinking i was going to tell you he was doing offbroadway theater,positive
you silly goose,positive
well gabe kaplan isnt in the movie rounders nor is the film about the actor come gamblers life,positive
but rounders is about poker and gabe plays poker and i thought that was kind of a neat connection,positive
sorry about the segue or lack thereof,positive
matt damon plays mike mcdermott a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker,positive
hes been playing for a while and more than being proficient he has caught the bug,positive
he goes to all the underground games in new york city knows the regulars and knows how to win,positive
in the beginning of the film hes built up a nice thirty grand nest egg which he takes to the speakeasytype gaming parlor where the big boys play,positive
mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb john malkovich an oreomunching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia,positive
mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker but instead he loses it all in a single hand,positive
months later hes paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck,positive
when mikes best friend and poker buddy worm edward norton finishes his jail term for hustling some students he wants to pick up right were they left off working as a team to part others with their betting cash,positive
although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student jo gretchen mol worm connives mike into playing once more and mike bitten again by the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life,positive
to make a film about gambling a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters,positive
this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth,positive
rounders however seems to go more for the latter than the former,positive
the card clubs mike and worm frequent arent very glamorous at all,positive
theres a basement a lodge with elk heads on the wall a goulash joint these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots,positive
except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table,positive
the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it,positive
were given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations and good actors to play them,positive
matt damon is very natural as mike who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker,positive
ed nortons worm is truly a worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what theyre worth,positive
john turturro who amazes me with his acting range tones it down in this film by playing joey knish a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments,positive
hes both a friend and mentor to mike and turturros lowkey performance is totally convincing just as john malkovichs heavilyaccented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself,positive
martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mikes law professors abe petrovsky,positive
while landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to ones self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending,positive
perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable lineup of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just didnt seem to have much presence on screen,positive
shes a genuine peach to look at kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and i wouldnt be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blondhaired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and i found myself looking for matt damons reactions instead,positive
a good thing about rounders is that it doesnt get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it cant find time for humor,positive
the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next in widely different locales,positive
one game in a cigar club had me in stitches,positive
i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper says one of the players clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other,positive
i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys,positive
with all the poker being played rounders had the potential to be very confusing,positive
you might think you know a lot about poker but think again,positive
luckily were given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain whats going on,positive
the narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do,positive
its nice that as the characters develop so does our comprehension of their world,positive
as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounders delivers in spades,positive
wait,positive
as a film about the culture of cards rounders is an ace,positive
hang on,positive
packed with great acting and great characters rounders is a full house,positive
okay i guess thats enough,positive
oh by the way if you ever want to get into a game with ol gabe kaplan be sure to bring a note from epsteins mother,positive
in many ways twotg does for toughguy movies what la confidential did for police stories,positive
theres savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold,positive
but i suppose we wouldnt expect less from christopher mcquarrie who was responsible for giving us the usual suspects,positive
his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry,positive
the two goons are parker and longbaugh ryan phillipe and benicio del toro,positive
these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough,positive
their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive,positive
given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime theyll always choose the latter,positive
yet they are incredibly foolish planners,positive
actually these two never really have a plan,positive
they just improvise along the way hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked,positive
their next scheme which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonalds burger is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin juliette lewis that was hired by some welltodo family,positive
if all goes well theyll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on,positive
what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family whose patriarch is a feared crime boss,positive
moreover two bodyguards nicky katt and taye diggs constantly escort her,positive
these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations,positive
they would rather die than fail thus their bravado level is equally high,positive
but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher and they employ some unusual but funtowatch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slowmotion car chase down a series of alleyways,positive
the next hour or so we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation,positive
during this time additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed,positive
because the chidducks can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome,positive
we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause,positive
as a result there are undercurrents of a conspiracy and elements of betrayal and subterfuge,positive
the sepiatoned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur,positive
the momentum and the coolness of the film however begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money,positive
you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement,positive
in fact you may admire this film more than you like it,positive
yet for the most part the way of the gun stays on target,positive
it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry,positive
many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come the new film by visionary director vincent ward,positive
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors,positive
but little do they know as i so plainly found out that this has quite a complex story to tell,positive
walking out of the theater i could see the audiences disgust,positive
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended,positive
dont believe the previews that you see,positive
this is definitely not a film for everyone,positive
this is quite possibly one of the most adultoriented films to come out in recent years,positive
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline,positive
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us,positive
it goes back and forth in time as if it has no boundaries,positive
think of the film city of angels,positive
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision,positive
both films deal with the afterlife but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office,positive
costing around 85 million to make the film would have to do extremely well in order to make its money back,positive
but due to its story i doubt it will,positive
for everyone who thought titanics story was too simple and cliche here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay it may not have done nearly as well,positive
but dont get me wrong,positive
i hope the film does do well,positive
its a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen,positive
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place even in our own mind,positive
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals,positive
the only film that surpasses it is dark city,positive
full of rich shocking colors we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to,positive
but dont do that because youll end up going to hell,positive
what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake,positive
chris christy nielsen robin williams is startled by the sudden jolt but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat,positive
annie annabella sciorra spies chris as well and both eventually bond and get married,positive
annie is an artist whose paintings are colorful lush and surrealistic,positive
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself,positive
they also have two children marie jessica brooks and ian josh paddock,positive
but one day the two children are killed in a car crash and it almost destroys annie,positive
she tries to commit suicide but fails and is then put in an institution,positive
chris copes with the problem by realizing they arent around anymore and nothing will change that,positive
just as annie gets her life back in order chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim,positive
chris goes to heaven or his version of heaven rather,positive
guided by albert cuba gooding jr chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy,positive
that is until he realizes how miserable he is without annie,positive
prior to heaven he would try to comfort annie but the more he was around the more pain she felt,positive
chris decides to leave her alone,positive
little does he realize what will happen next,positive
im not about to say because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story many critics however give it away,positive
certainly chris dying is crucial to the plot but they tell you that he dies in the previews,positive
story is not necessarily important for this movie to work because it deals with the afterlife,positive
however strangely virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil,positive
a couple of comments here and there but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life,positive
were soul mates,positive
chris exclaims,positive
heaven in movies is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white purity and love,positive
usually it also looks like it rests among the clouds,positive
but what dreams may come goes a different route,positive
it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before,positive
chris heaven is his memories brought to life,positive
his thoughts can make anything real and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven,positive
ive never seen anyone use real paint before albert says,positive
equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone,positive
instead its a state of being,positive
in one gloriously horrific scene chris and his tracker max von sydow arrive at a sea of faces,positive
thousands of heads are stuck above ground their bodies somewhere else,positive
mostly dead silent some quips are made almost as if to lighten the mood,positive
its truly a frightening sequence,positive
production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination,positive
using state of the art computer technology worlds are created for exploration,positive
sometimes some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact,positive
its not necessary to be there but we appreciate seeing it,positive
costume designer yvonne blake who also appears in the film has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes,positive
cinematographer eduardo serra whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove has a difficult job as most cinematographers do working with special effects,positive
but serras entire universe is a computer generated image and he does a masterful job,positive
writer ron bass adapting from the novel by richard matheson provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot,positive
the story is extremely vague in its details allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning,positive
and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision,positive
what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience,positive
your average movie goer more than likely isnt used to expressionistic techniques,positive
the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people but they shouldnt take it too far,positive
it is after all just a movie,positive
robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances while his comedic roles have been suffering,positive
his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff but when is confined by a screenplay he isnt quite as effective,positive
but drama is really his strong point and you can see that here,positive
its doubtful hell get another oscar nomination but i wouldnt really mind if he did,positive
the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land,positive
this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention,positive
its also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination,positive
however the academy doesnt like to award performances for these types of films,positive
cuba gooding jr has been better but hes certainly not distracting,positive
max von sydow is underused as are jessica brooks and josh paddock,positive
a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear if they even recognize him as chris father lost in the sea of faces,positive
its not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images,positive
overall its williams and sciorras film,positive
what dreams may come is rated pg13 for thematic elements involving death some disturbing images language and some partial nudity,positive
the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience,positive
some will find the plot distracting,positive
some will find the visuals absolutely glorious,positive
and some will find both,positive
the only real problem with the film that i could see was that it slows down considerably during the midsection just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins,positive
by the way some controversy even surrounded the title which was mistaken for a sexual term what becomes wet and you should understand,positive
in actuality the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet,positive
just thought i should let you know,positive
if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia,positive
although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories mostly in ironic way like grosse pointe blank and romy michelles high school reunion some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones,positive
until that happens 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters,positive
contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times,positive
one of such movies one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen is william friedkins to live and die in l a,positive
the money isnt just the symbolic motive in the film it is the major elements of the plot,positive
rick masters willem dafoe is an exconvict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l a being too intelligent to fall into police traps and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career masters managed to elude law for years and became well connected,positive
richard chance william l petersen is a secret service agent adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters,positive
however his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another,positive
finally he sets up a final sting but his superiors deny him the necessary money,positive
being frustrated and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich bill pankow he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier,positive
their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway,positive
like french connection one of his previous masterpieces this friedkins movie was inspired by real life,positive
gerrald petievich author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay spent many years working as a secret service agent,positive
that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency not much utilised by hollywood,positive
secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed the beginning scene where the movies hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagans speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times,positive
ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie,positive
willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesnt seem like affliction in the reagan years on the contrary those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable,positive
compared with him and all the other side characters that want their piece of the action two heroes on the side of law seem like losers,positive
instead of being a classical good guy secret service agent richard chance portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement his sidekick who should serve as those better judgement is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end,positive
in such surroundings of moral decay the not so happy yet surprising ending doesnt seem out of line although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered,positive
the dark atmosphere of l a city of glamour and moral decay is nicely captured by william friedkins directing skills,positive
the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro dean stockwell debra feuer darlanne fleugel and steve james gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece great car chase,positive
that scene alone with lot of realism thrills and surprise twists is worth seeing the rest of the film,positive
the soundtrack provided by now almost forgotten band wang chung is also one of the more memorable of that decade,positive
in every case to live and die in l a is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it,positive
well i know that stallone is 50 years old now but in daylight he doesnt look it,positive
daylight is a great disaster movie,positive
if youve seen cliffhanger youll know stallones character already,positive
a guy with a bad past but is in the right place at the wrong time,positive
a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying very flammable toxic waste,positive
a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball and what a fire ball it was,positive
stallone a former emergency medical service man is chauffeuring a rich couple around when they reach the outside of the tunnel before the explosion,positive
then 30 minutes into the movie boom,positive
from here on the plot takes a back seat and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged,positive
most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat,positive
there are a few melodramatic parts here but they tend to work out well,positive
there is no general antagonist in this film but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that,positive
daylight is a great film i saw a nonmatinee showing of it and i thought it was worth every penny,positive
the characterizations are mostly flat one dimesional but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters,positive
rob cohen dragonheart does a great job with this film,positive
expectation rating a bit worse than expected mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull,positive
roger ebert gave it a four star review and while he is a critic that uses the full scale and i often agree such as dark city being the best film of 1998 he must have seen a better film,positive
i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it,positive
the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter,positive
the landscape is snowy and cold and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner which also reminds me of fargo which i loathed,positive
one can almost sense the cold,positive
but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead instead raimi has made a more constrained film which probably is for the better,positive
this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots,positive
the movie also reminded me of affliction as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father and they see a chance for such a dream to come true,positive
this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field where an airplane has crash landed,positive
in the plane three men find the american dream,positive
in a gym bag,positive
affliction too was set in a snowy landscape,positive
it really seems very simple,positive
just hold on to the money until spring and if no one claims it theyll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true,positive
but the snow melts and so might several of the characters hopes,positive
as in return to paradise some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing,positive
but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish,positive
the movies biggest strength is that it fact makes sense,positive
i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story for example clear and present danger,positive
the biggest problem seems to overfamiliarization with the story,positive
the writer perhaps feels that he doesnt have to present scenes that are clear to him but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book,positive
this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan even though the screenplay is by the books author,positive
the movie is always clear on where its going and always makes sense,positive
im sue a lot was cut but really i cant remember what,positive
even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included,positive
the man only comes in on mondays but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many,positive
turns out,positive
well see the movie,positive
one should be warned against seeing the trailer,positive
it reveals several scenes from the ending moments which yes like in the book it is a downer several plot developments and much of the beginning,positive
but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer so if youre lucky youll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie,positive
director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films,positive
you need look no further than die hard he was director of photography speed and last years twister for examples of his hi octane edge of your seat thrill prowess,positive
speed 2 is no exception,positive
this time the action takes place on a huge cruise liner on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship,positive
yep thats right no keanu reeves this time but fear not jason patrick is more than up to the job,positive
speaking of which the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist willem dafoe from crashing the liner into a huge island after stealing a diamond collection,positive
the reason for this act of destruction is revenge,positive
after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers he contracts copper poisoning and is retired,positive
naturally what entails next is a lot of about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day,positive
thinking back on this film you cant help but admire its structure,positive
the way willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers,positive
the race against time to save the liner from crashing and of course the finale chase scence,positive
although this is ruined by an over the top one too many stunt and explosion,positive
simple in construction effective in its execution and the result a clear and concise highly enjoyable action film,positive
the acting is adequate although its darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a hot totty appeal to the men and she does that perfectly jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist,positive
overall speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride,positive
not up to its predecessors high calibre but very good all the same,positive
there is plenty going on some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie,positive
billed as a feminist sex fantasy this spirited imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the awardwinning canadian director cynthia roberts is destined for extreme reactions,positive
camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heartfelt tale of the title character bubbles galore nina hartley a pornactressturnedpornproducer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence,positive
however those in the andrea dworkin camp will no doubt loathe the films decidedly proporn stance,positive
political considerations aside however this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers shauny sexton,positive
in the backdrop however is bubbles loyal assistant vivian klitorsky tracy wright who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss,positive
this femmebutchfemme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity and sensuality,positive
in addition to the romantic aspects of the story bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her exboyfriend godfrey montana daniel macivor a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it,positive
when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her,positive
these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence,positive
god herself yes in the world of this film god is most definitely a her and a chorus of undulating scantilyclad angels have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction,positive
this bright colourful and deliriously sexy film is chockfull of great performances,positive
making her dramatic debut after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary straight actresses to shame,positive
hartley has overwhelming star power and one wonders why other nontriplex producers havent used her bountiful talents,positive
it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of boogie nights a film which takes a far more traditional doomandgloom approach to the porn industry,positive
making a cameo appearance in the role of god former porn actress annie sprinkle a true artist in her own right gives the entire film an earthy sensual glow and certainly solidifies and by her very appearance downright justifies the themes of the movie,positive
the other performances are equally solid,positive
daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role,positive
shauny sexton an erotic dancer and pinup model makes an impressive screen debut,positive
overall bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed,positive
at one point the title character declares that instead of trying to save women from the sex trade we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work,positive
the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive,positive
roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straightahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avantgarde montage sequences,positive
the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful,positive
the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70s porn and psychedelia,positive
amazingly this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies,positive
this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture as one cannot imagine such an entertaining original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day,positive
bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not at present appear to have any traditional distribution in place so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one,positive
its funny sexy and subversive,positive
and it shouldnt be missed,positive
frequency n,positive
the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable etc,positive
dont worry,positive
when watching the thriller frequency you wont have to know what the heck frequency means,positive
the premise although it may sound complex is very basic on the big screen,positive
a new york cop john jim caviezel finds a radio in his house which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father frank dennis quaid who died thirty years ago,positive
immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse,positive
when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasnt supposed to the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders johns mother and nine other women,positive
it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place,positive
i told you that wasnt confusing,positive
overall i was very pleased with frequency,positive
its occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes,positive
i usually dont buy those cheesy i love you dad segments in movies but this one surprisingly satisfied me,positive
maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative,positive
frequencys creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended what if,positive
what would i do,positive
would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated,positive
or stop some kids from shooting other kids,positive
or buy stock from yahoo,positive
a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences,positive
frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future,positive
both share that change the past slightly and youll change the future heavily warning,positive
the changes between the present and the past such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs are very similar,positive
both are also wonderful feelgood family films that can attract to a number of generations,positive
the only difference worth noting is that frequencys final scene doesnt set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making,positive
there are some problems with the film though,positive
first there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is,positive
the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently no pun intended switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story,positive
another problem is that the supporting cast including noah emmerich and andre braugher are underused,positive
while in the film which is not enough the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in,positive
frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end,positive
even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you like it almost did for me check this movie out,positive
you may be surprised as well,positive
dreamworks pictures presents a jinks cohen company production kevin spacey annette bening american beauty thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley and chris cooper coproducers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l hall a s c,positive
produced by bruce cohen dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes,positive
both my wife and daughter think im this gigantic loser,positive
and theyre right,positive
i have lost something,positive
i didnt always feel this sedated,positive
with that piece of dialogue we are fully introduced to lester burnham kevin spacey a 42 year old man trapped within his own life,positive
lester works for an advertising agency,positive
his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the midlife crisis he is suffering,positive
estranged from both his wife and his daughter lester starts to crack under the stress,positive
his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies and sullen apathy,positive
carolyn burnham annette bening is the prototypical career woman homemaker,positive
she carefully tends her rose garden decorates her home with the best furnishings,positive
but inside she is desperate,positive
unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family,positive
the third member of this antifamily is jane burnham thora birch lester and carolyns daughter,positive
a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction,positive
this funny and frightening slice of life is refreshingly simple,positive
not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her,positive
some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters,positive
most notably is barbara fitts allison janney the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts,positive
she has almost no dialogue and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one,positive
colonel fitts chris cooper is an angry and frightened man,positive
his rage directed almost singularly at his son ricky wes bentley who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnhams,positive
in fact they are the next door neighbors,positive
anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in american beauty,positive
alan ball who was the coexecutive producer of the hit tv series cybil and creator of the new sitcom oh grow up has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years,positive
not one character in this film rings falsely,positive
and the depth of personality in each is achingly honest and insightful,positive
the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as the graduate or lolita,positive
kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances,positive
his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age,positive
finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become lester tries to return to his youth,positive
he quits his job actually blackmailing his employer for one years salary starts smoking pot fantasizes about his daughters girlfriend angela mena suvari in a marvelous performance here starts working out and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet,positive
mr spaceys performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous that we can be certain that come oscar time we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees,positive
annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career,positive
carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy,positive
unable to cope with her growing disillusionment she forces herself to maintain her demeanor driving her further and further into desperation adultery and possibly murder,positive
ms bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone,positive
the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words,positive
thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her,positive
jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment,positive
her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning,positive
she is the prototypical trophy child,positive
when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team im so proud of you honey,positive
you didnt screw up once the bitterness and resentment are palpable,positive
thora birch is a young actress to watch,positive
praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance,positive
colonel finn is a man in complete denial,positive
his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend,positive
wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma,positive
the boy next door who may be more foe than friend,positive
a deceitful and calculating young man whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him,positive
mr bentleys performance is the one troublesome note in the film,positive
that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar that one almost faults the performance for it,positive
director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle,positive
scenes of carolyn walking through the rain carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character,positive
the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful capturing the season in all of its harsh beauty fall has never looked so inviting yet depressing,positive
every nuance of american beauty begs its audience to think and examine,positive
it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come,positive
and well it should as it is simply one of this years best,positive
brian depalma needs a hit really badly,positive
since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 depalma has seen casualties of war raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames,positive
consequently it would be easy enough to consider carlitos way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma reteaming with al pacino scarface and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes,positive
it doesnt hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn,positive
carlitos way while hampered by depalmas characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism is a truly tense and engrossing drama,positive
carlito brigante pacino is a lifelong criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance,positive
in 1975 carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality,positive
he declares himself reformed tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas,positive
among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld penn carlitos crooked attorney and childhood friend and bodyguard pachanga luis guzman,positive
carlito rediscovers old flame gail penelope ann miller and seems ready to retire in peace,positive
old ways die hard though and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he cant seem to shake,positive
carlitos way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film,positive
in the first carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station,positive
both highlight depalmas gift for choreographed mayhem and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely,positive
yet for all the viscera i found the character study even more compelling,positive
carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit,positive
but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera theres more of an immediacy to carlitos way an everpresent sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion,positive
you sense that theres no way after so many years that carlito can stay out of trouble,positive
indeed he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart you dont get reformed you just run out of wind,positive
pacino captures carlitos dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy,positive
sean penn is even better turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld,positive
a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder,positive
he could have been simply pathetic a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct,positive
he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink making the moment he goes over quite jolting,positive
as compelling as the narrative is viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu,positive
depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas,positive
he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms like a 360 degree swing around a kiss vertigo via body double and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables,positive
from a story standpoint theres an obligatory love story with a cliched longsuffering girlfriend character,positive
penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesnt do anything new with the role and eventually she becomes just a distraction never integrated fully enough into the story,positive
still its easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid,positive
the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldnt break,positive
carlitos way plays like a tragic novel deliberate confident and powerful,positive
those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well rewarded,positive
quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie,positive
he runs into the last dragon in existence and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain,positive
eventually they decide to call a truce and they work out a deal,positive
since he is the last dragon he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it,positive
their scam works at first until they come to a town without any money,positive
instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon but of course draco is a nice droagon so he wont eat her there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl,positive
of course as you can probably tell by the plot this is a silly movie but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times unlike eddie which was serious all the time,positive
you could probably call this a medieval comedy because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined,positive
dennis quaid makes a fine hero,positive
pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them,positive
dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl,positive
but lets face it the movie is really about the dragon and what an amazing creation he is,positive
connerys voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon,positive
so if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic you are going to the wrong movie,positive
if you are going because of the dragon you will not be dissapointed and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script,positive
the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80s,positive
more practiced as a cinematographer than a director bava nonetheless sat in the directors chair for beyond the door ii the project which turned out to be his last fulllength feature film,positive
alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci beyond the door ii is simply a revelation,positive
in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970s,positive
note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcistrip off behind the door but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia,positive
this story focuses on dora a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco,positive
the film opens with dora her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husbands suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier,positive
they hope to put the past behind them but as small accidents start to befall dora usually while bruno is away on business she starts to suspect that marco played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr is somehow involved in the strange goings on,positive
to reveal any more of the story would be unfair,positive
suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot loads of atmosphere and solid acting though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english,positive
bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi wife of famed italian horror director dario argento,positive
her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with doras troubled soul,positive
the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective mixing oddsounding 70s rock with classic gothic piano sequences,positive
and there is at least one moment brilliantly engineered by bava that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair,positive
yet for italian horror the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal,positive
lamberto bava and francesco barbieris script is more concerned with deeper psychological terrors with themes of guilt and suffering with the notion that what we sow will shall somewhere somehow eventually reap,positive
scholars of the genre take note beyond the door ii is stylish chilling and essential,positive
natural born killers is really a very simple story that in essence has already been told in bonnie clyde with some major variations in emphasis mood and degree,positive
both films glamorize outlaws in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers,positive
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love,positive
but where bonnie clyde was partial and subtle natural born killers is total and blatant,positive
where bonnie clyde was social natural born killers is psychological,positive
what bonnie clyde hinted at natural born killers confronts and explores,positive
what bonnie and clyde stole mickey and mallory kill,positive
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them expressed metaphorically as killing subdues the mysterious power this film wields,positive
for the most part when mickey and mallory kill they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily they kill what is trying to kill them they kill what dissembles and cowers from life they kill what needs to be killed,positive
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity,positive
brahma created,positive
vishnu preserved,positive
and siva destroyed but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma,positive
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate im forced to say it for claritys sake a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes that is destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics,positive
your plumber bonnie and clyde mickey and mallory and siva are all productive destroyers,positive
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death presently and historically than any other phenomena,positive
muslims kill christians,positive
hindus kill muslims,positive
christians kill pagans,positive
jews kill christians etc you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged,positive
religion is an orgy of killing,positive
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasnt been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable,positive
the state is the divine idea upon earth hegel said meaning it is absolute allpowerful ineffable unassailable infallible authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh allah god etc,positive
well what does all this have to do with natural born killers,positive
let me first say that religions of this nature in the ideal take the place of sex,positive
consider the catholic church which in its heydey took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever,positive
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope cardinals bishops monks etc they forego the one in order to come closer to the other,positive
during the middle ages when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power,positive
parenthetically witness plato as well,positive
in the republic he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime,positive
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself regularly assailing the passions,positive
catholicism as policy attacks the passions as evil,positive
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure,positive
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution,positive
this is religion this is authoritarianism in its essence,positive
as further evidence the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters,positive
our culture most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years,positive
we cant help but adopt even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self,positive
mickey and mallory knox internalized them too then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other discovered them and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves,positive
it is a straightforward liberation through sex,positive
as some good patriarch once observed you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on,positive
mm had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions,positive
they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions,positive
the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers as mickey says,positive
as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter let us look each other in the face,positive
we are hyberboreanswe know well enough how remote our place is,positive
neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans even pindar in his day knew that much about us,positive
beyond the north beyond ice beyond deathour life our happiness,positive
we have discovered that happiness we know the way we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth,positive
who else has found it the,positive
man of today i,positive
dont know either the way out or the way in i am whatever doesnt know either the way out or the way in so sighs the man of today,positive
this is the sort of modernity that made us illwe sickened in lazy peace cowardly compromise the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay,positive
this tolerance and largeur of the heart that forgives everything because it understands everything is a sirocco to us,positive
rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such southwinds,positive
as far as i can tell this is what the movie has to say,positive
its alleged critique of the media is only secondary tertiary quaternary subsidiary for sure,positive
for example wayne gayles first report ends with some gen x dude saying if i were a mass murderer id be mickey and mallory in his most excellent bill and ted voice,positive
on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes,positive
it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what mm were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself hed be just like them killing and destroying what deserves it,positive
let me exemplify what ive been saying by analyzing a scene from the film namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant kills him and then castigates him for giving her the worst fuckin head ive ever had in my life,positive
now i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship because demonstrably they didnt and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this,positive
sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations but unwilling to kill each other since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation they must kill in place of their lever,positive
its no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey,positive
as the attendant approached he took on mickeys character in the eyes of mallory,positive
she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory,positive
upon discovery mallory views this as a betrayal judges him and commutes his sentence on someone else,positive
the style of the movie is a whole nother matter that i wont get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power,positive
let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle,positive
the rapid succession of all those 8mm 16mm 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish frenetic mood,positive
also jungian archetypes abound,positive
these cant help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames,positive
some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind quotes are paraphrased only,positive
mickey to mallory one of these days im gonna be cummin for you in prison while mallory jacks mickey off,positive
semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come,positive
at the time they havent yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet,positive
the two of course go hand in hand,positive
for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs,positive
mickey during his marriage to mallory as creator of my universe i pronounce us man and wife,positive
the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting but telling too,positive
it reveals mm are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones,positive
this is what mickey means by creator of my universe he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes,positive
it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears,positive
scagnettis first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendants mouth,positive
the indian sage releasing mallorys father who was reincarnated as a snake old man go be a snake after telling his snake story that ends with bitch you knew i was a snake,positive
after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare mallory says you killed life,positive
this is another telling quote because it implies they didnt see themselves as killers of life,positive
then what were they killing up to that time,positive
in some case just those zombies faking their way through life the living dead as it were,positive
in other cases all the antilife forces the cops and their parents,positive
the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison,positive
it of course symbolizes rebirth,positive
dr emil reingold as portrayed by steven wright passing judgement on mm mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong they just dont give a damn,positive
this is reminiscent of nietzsches whole philosophy and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil,positive
mickey the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers,positive
mickey again in his interview me and you we are not the same species,positive
notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control,positive
mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang,positive
the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader no matter who it is,positive
mickey how ya feelin,positive
wayne fucking great,positive
mickey you got the feelin,positive
wayne im alive,positive
im alive for the first fuckin time,positive
what an incredible transformation this is,positive
he got the feeling and he couldnt contain himself,positive
what a feeling,positive
that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe,positive
mickey when almost caught in a dead end think think think think,positive
go figure it out,positive
dwight tommy lee jones in general because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film,positive
his whole attitude can be summed up with destroy them,positive
why do people hate the spice girls,positive
what exactly have they done wrong other than perhaps offend the fashion police,positive
so what if they are not great singersthey aint singing opera folks its pop music,positive
who exactly is a great singer,positive
judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls,positive
they do what they dosing some catchy tunesand they do it pretty well,positive
they are able to carry that into their first film spice world,positive
spice world certainly isnt a great filmgoing experience,positive
what it is what the spice girls are all about fun songs and a lot of girl power,positive
drawing from a number of different films like the beatles hard days night spice world chronicles the week heading up to the girls first concert at londons albert hall,positive
they get to tool around london in a big ol bus driven by meat loaf and generally have fun,positive
in order to through a semblence of plot into the film there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries better known to americans for about 15 minutes as dame edna remember her,positive
he wants to sabotage the girls concert so he can sell papers,positive
of course the point in a movie like spice world isnt plot,positive
the center of the film is the spice girls themselves ginger the recently departed geri haliwell posh victoria adams sporty melanie chisolm scary melanie brown and baby emma bunton,positive
each one has their own personality and perhaps the best part of the film look like they are having some honesttogoodness fun something that cant be said for a lot of people in films today,positive
along for the ride are richard e grant as their manager clifford and various other characters making quick cameo appearances including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry,positive
and every once and a while roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans added bonus he gets to in the words of craig kilborn dance dance dance,positive
watching this film was fun for the most part,positive
there are a few slow segments but overly director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background,positive
his camerawork is fairly pedestrian though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing,positive
the look of the film promotes the high fun with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eyecatching,positive
add in walltowall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp,positive
if you dont like the spice girls you wont change your mind with this film,positive
but if you find them at least tolerable get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you,positive
and do it quite well,positive

when i first saw the previews for ron howards latest film my expectations were discouragingly low,positive
a show about nothing,positive
sounds like seinfeld,positive
a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day,positive
sounds like the truman show,positive
what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants another puts one out about bugs,positive
which is why i was pleasantly surprised by edtv which turns out to be a fresh insightful and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity,positive
the writing by howards longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus,positive
in the hands of a lessexperienced director edtv could easily have had all the flavor of yesterdays meatloaf,positive
with their true tv cable ratings being threatened by the gardening channel apparently people would rather watch soil the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers,positive
program director cynthia topping ellen degeneres comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment,positive
the hook is to find a regular guy someone normal that people can relate to,positive
while scouting possible candidates cynthias camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray woody harrelson in a bar where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame,positive
but on watching the videotape the shows producers are more taken with ed than with ray,positive
hes cute he says all the wrong things and hes 100 usda hick,positive
cynthias boss played by rob reiner gives the show a week to deliver the goods and its tough going in the early stages,positive
the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth,positive
action shot,positive
wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster,positive
you get the idea,positive
but soon enough thingsnielsenboosting kinds of thingsstart to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the true tv cameras are right there to document it,positive
eds privacy is no longer his own his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media,positive
who should ed go out with,positive
you can be sure the pollsters have a list,positive
not only is the film exceedingly well cast but its performers are consistently excellent,positive
matthew mcconaughey provides the face the body language and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of americas latest phenomenon,positive
he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers,positive
sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as eds mother and martin landau is one of the films highlights as al eds ailing stepfather,positive
jenna elfman from tvs dharma and greg proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting,positive
even degeneres and reiner are better than youd expect,positive
in 1979 comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called real life in which a smalltime opportunist makes a realtime documentary about a typical american family,positive
the scenes of eds family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a bigbudget variant on that film paralleling its wickedly inventive humor,positive
as with most films by albert brooks real life was funny but absurd,positive
the funniestand scariestthing about edtv is that it is absolutely believable,positive
with many bigbudget science fiction films great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts cheesy plot twists and terrible acting,positive
the fifth element the abyss and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting writing or both,positive
at first glance the matrix larry andy wachowskis sci emup spectacular looks like a prime candidate to join the list of highconcept bad movies especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role,positive
but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue the matrix works,positive
its an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films most obviously the terminator films star wars and total recall but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout,positive
reeves plays neo a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with trinity carrieanne moss a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks a unseen omniscient cult figure known as morpheus lawrence fishburne and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell,positive
neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems,positive
moreover he discovers that the grim bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it,positive
neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah with grave doubts that he is actually the one prophesized to come and save the world,positive
reluctant or not what follows is a mix of hong kongstyle slowmotion shootouts surreal dream sequences high speed chases and comic book kungfu fights,positive
the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality,positive
how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind,positive
and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion,positive
unfortunately the matrix doesnt provide many answers to the questions it raises but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions shootouts and flying roundhouse kicks,positive
perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving who plays agent smith the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix,positive
weavings stony appearance deadpan voice and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting evil technological force that controls the matrix,positive
like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t1000 terminator in terminator 2 judgement day weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because despite his power and seeming invincibility he looks ordinary even scrawny,positive
weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence,positive
the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography,positive
it seems to be deliberately kitchy with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors,positive
in a few scenes the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny,positive
just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring,positive
however with the comicbook style and tone of the film you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience,positive
the matrix isnt a classic,positive
its openended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers,positive
it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions,positive
it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero the kind of shmaltzy feelgood goo that most of the film avoids,positive
reportedly the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel,positive
unfortunately audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future,positive
the matrix is an fun enjoyable diversion like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival,positive
just dont be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry,positive
errol morris critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast cheap and out of control vaults to new heights with mr,positive
death,positive
this film an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a leuchter jr is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise stunning even the more jaded minds among us,positive
dont let the films cheesy dissuade you,positive
following this sideshow of horrorlab special effects we are plunged quickly into a nonstop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchters life and mind,positive
morris follows the trail of leuchters madness with appalling lucidity revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with this leuchter guy is seriously messed up,positive
virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries in spite of his lack of credentials,positive
after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows leuchter came to the attention of neonazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his theory that the holocaust never happened,positive
morriss interviews are surprisingly congenial drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves,positive
zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch,positive
leuchter seems completely at ease sometimes jovial,positive
part of this effect may be due to morriss new interviewing machine called the interrotron which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer,positive
this was the first time morris had used the device and the results are startling,positive
combine the irony of these interviews with leuchters reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant and youve got one compelling and disturbing documentary,positive
while this film isnt for the feebleminded or weakhearted it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape,positive
aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i for one feel bettered by the experience,positive
showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer,positive
their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curryspiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyones taste but certainly a wellcrafted movie,positive
possibly that movies greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie,positive
and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the characters future so there was no need to film it,positive
there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways to get it all onscreen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails,positive
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls,positive
we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent whos trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do,positive
but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner,positive
in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven whos not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and were left feeling good about her future,positive
this is not one of the great movies but its far better than wed been led to expect by all the negative prerelease publicity,positive
verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 and in the last quartercentury has pushed farther and farther experimenting with the sociallyacceptable limits to moviemaking,positive
his most recent three movies robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of backdoor access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives and now hes exploring the sleeze,positive
this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the directors contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie,positive
verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video,positive
many reviewers have taken the politicallycorrect stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies its about people in an environment where naked ladies are common and why such an environment should exist,positive
its about the scum who use other people as powertrip toys and the need to escape their power,positive
its about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values dont pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment,positive
an nc17 movie which isnt sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value,positive
the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator,positive
if anything its a rape scene with a victim whos been duped into cooperation,positive
you dont make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors you dont make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed and you dont make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls,positive
and in an awful lot of vegas shows an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing,positive
this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity,positive
showgirls deglamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness,positive
nomi is played in a very good performance by elizabeth berkley who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents whos at the end of her rope desperate to live a life better than the one shes known,positive
she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker trying to be something better than she seems destined to be,positive
when nomi realizes shes gone too far for too little she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be,positive
gina rivera plays molly a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her with what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomis entire life,positive
molly is the one who makes the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system shell be using for the rest of her life and nomis feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomis decision,positive
gina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer a reflexively competitive manipulator whos become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her,positive
gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch a fading talent made bitter by selfawareness,positive
her character is very well drawn and performed in a major scene in a hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch to nomi,positive
the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path,positive
it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe molly is an honest hardworking person who means well and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality,positive
cristal is a talented dancer whos compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a cooperating part of the system exchanging selfrespect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas,positive
nomi believes she can make it without selling herself succumbs to a degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesnt need las vegas or its brand of stardom,positive
the male parts in this movie are simply props they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist,positive
kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs camouflaged as a nice guy,positive
glenn plummer plays a dancer whos working as a bellboy and provides a bit of alternate perspective,positive
plummers character is the only one in the movie whos maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art but even hes succumbed to the cult of manipulation,positive
plummers character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie,positive
some of jost vacanos cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomis character alteration a nodialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting is utterly terrifying,positive
this movie is rated nc17 due to language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming as well,positive
i dont see a way this particular story could have been told well without it and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in moviemaking,positive
but dont go see it if youre not in a tough mood the only person its possible to like in this movie ends up in an i c u,positive
on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie youd enjoy meeting in person,positive
ingredients downonhisluck evangelist church,positive
synopsis sonny dewey robert duvall is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife farrah fawcett in bed with another guy,positive
in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guys head and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder and estranged from his wife and two kids,positive
to atone for his sins sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature the apostle e f as the apostle e f sonnys main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station,positive
soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple,positive
but sonny knows his time is short one day the police will find him,positive
opinion this movie is a thoughtprovoking look at an evangelist in real life terms,positive
i believe that robert duvall who is the producer director writer and main star of the apostle deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film,positive
duvalls portrayal of a true believer is authentic superb and inspired it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion as well as a portrait of a fallible complicated man driven by his beliefs,positive
incidentally in real life duvall was just as driven in getting the project underway,positive
since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done paying for its production with his own money about five million dollars,positive
in terms of hardhitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film,positive
similarly those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thoughtprovoking experience,positive
on the other hand the apostles main strength duvalls preaching is also what limits the apostles target audience,positive
in terms of plot and pure entertainment value the apostle is definitely not for everyone,positive
teenagers action fans comedy fans and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church,positive
in other words the apostle is a four star performance but with a very limited audience,positive
the characters in palmetto collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie and its just the right way to capture the films ripe atmosphere of sensuality tension and even farce,positive
this humid floridaset thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke,positive
as far as setup is concerned the movie is nothing we havent seen before but be patient palmetto spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really dont see coming,positive
its not a classic by any means but it sure is quite an engaging surprise,positive
harry barber woody harrelson is fresh out of prison where hes served a couple of years for a crime he didnt commit,positive
even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials harrys first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina gina gershon,positive
while searching for work he catches the eye of rhea malroux elisabeth shue the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire,positive
rhea proposes a scheme thatll get harry 50 000 easy to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny,positive
you do like risks dont you mr barber,positive
rhea alluringly coos,positive
boys form a line behind me,positive
part of palmetto s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue who demonstrates here that her oscarnominated turn in leaving las vegas might merely be foreshadowing great things to come,positive
shues a seductive campy delight and pulls off a barbara stanwyckgloria swanson combo with admirable relish,positive
the other actors form a solid ensemble around her including sevigny kids tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease as well as the everlikeable gershon cast a far cry from her extreme roles in bound and showgirls,positive
harrelson is still doing fine followup work to the people vs larry flynt,positive
palmetto does have its share of grievances,positive
harrelsons narration is needless i suppose and gershons nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is,positive
one of the plots unexpected angles that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which hes involved could have been played a little better,positive
there are moments when you question the tone but its never so unstable that it deserves the reproach its been receiving from most other critics,positive
if palmetto didnt want to be laughed at would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a liveaction who framed roger rabbit,positive
although a few elements can be questioned the movie works well on its own terms,positive
thanks to a juicy cast especially shue and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff you remember him from last summers suddenly repopular the tin drum right,positive
everything runs smoothly,positive
and for fans of revelationheavy endings this films got a few shocks in store that i wont even dream of revealing,positive
palmetto is a generous amount of fun to watch and thats all you need to know,positive
mpaa not rated though i feel it would likely be pg for martialarts violence,positive
with three movies already re released theatrically in america and at least three more on their way jackie chan is one of the newest hot properties in action adventure stardom and its just about time,positive
for over twentyfive years jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy,positive
drunken master has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to make it big this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong,positive
im not entirely sure why exactly,positive
in many ways drunken master is similar to most of jackies other early films such as fearless hyena i and ii master with cracked fingers half a loaf of kung fu spiritual kung fu and others,positive
in fact looking at all these early films together one gets the impression that they were stamped out cookiecutter style at a rate of four to six per year all using the same casts and telling very similar stories,positive
to be honest i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste,positive
theyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america,positive
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together,positive
drunken master though its plot is tighter than some is no exception,positive
as an aside drunken master was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen in,positive
a movie theater in seattle as part of an asian film festival,positive
at the time i didnt really think it was anything special but,positive
after having seen more films like it its kind of grown on me,positive
drunken master s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies such as fearless hyena i and ii and master with cracked fingers slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harshseeming master and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end a formula that has been adapted to put it kindly by american films such as karate kid,positive
more specifically jackie chan plays the part of wong feihong aka naughty panther a funloving practicaljoking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good but not quite good enough,positive
after embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly then beating up a bully in a marketplace wong feihong tries to hit on a pretty girl but discovers that she and her mother can hit back better than he can and,positive
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt respectively,positive
his father wong keiying is unhappy about this and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages,positive
keiying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment which feihong does not like at all,positive
while escaping from this punishment feihong meets up with a drunken old man who proceeds to thrash him soundly then take him on as a student and thrash him some more,positive
this turns out to be su huachi a legendary master of drunkenstyle kung fu,positive
he assigns feihong a series of bizarre tasks such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame cracking walnuts with his hands and other such exercises that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up,positive
then when hes ready he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu,positive
unfortunately the lazy feihong only practices six of them,positive
drunken master features some wonderful martial arts sequences with jackie winning some fights and losing others,positive
its been said before but ill say it againthese fights dont just happen theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance and it shows,positive
in his fights jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches jugs cups bowls fruits and vegetablesoften in new and surprising ways,positive
the fight scenes particularly those toward the end of the film are unparallelled in most american films,positive
whether jackie wins or loses its really something to see and,positive
its often as funny as anything too,positive
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very very good at,positive
theres very little thats new in this moviejackie winning fights jackie getting beaten badly by a master jackie going through punishment or training these,positive
schticks have all been seen before in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties,positive
but theyre still hilarious as ever,positive
likewise jackie has a great supporting cast many of whom were also in other early jackie films and theyre often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own,positive
the really big thing about drunken master though that inspired several copycats including a couple starring jackie himself and a sequel fifteen years later was the drunkenstyle kung fu,positive
im not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security and,positive
it apparently helps if youre drunk while youre doing it,positive
genuine or not i have to admit theres just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whats going on,positive
come to think of it perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films its,positive
not just martial arts its the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go whoa,positive
on the negative side the cinematography in this film is nothing special the film stock is rather primitive the plot is often rather slow and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background,positive
gone with the wind this isnt,positive
still if you like martial arts films or like what youve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more give it a shot,positive
its much more real than chuck norris or jeanclaude van damme,positive
you might very well like it,positive
another interesting thing about drunken master has to do with its video availability in the us,positive
drunken master is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available on vhs from magnum video in a gold box for about 10,positive
there are plenty of other early jackie films around but these are typically either in dubbed panandscanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase,positive
thankfully drunken master at least is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen at a very affordable price,positive
if you like drunken master take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there even the dubbed ones arent really too bad if,positive
nothing else you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue,positive
i particularly recommend spiritual kung fu half a loaf of kung fu the fearless hyena movies and snake crane arts of shaolin,positive
also the mostlyunrelatedstorywise sequel drunken master ii will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year though what its americanrelease title will be is still uncertain and comes highly recommended by this reviewer,positive
also for a rather different interpretation of the character wong feihong who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ive been told to suggest the once upon a time in china series starring jet li though i havent personally seen any of them yet,positive
if you choose to watch drunken master i really hope you enjoy it and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema thats out there,positive
all in all i give this film an,positive
vampire films as well as other horror films are usually dumb and predictable bmovies meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks,positive
it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning but has also a plot worth making movies about,positive
based on anne rices novel interview with a vampire is a long dark trip to hell,positive
the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of presentday san francisco,positive
the camera slowly find particular window,positive
a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness,positive
so you want me to tell you the story of my life,positive
the mysterious man is louis brad pitt a twocentury old vampire telling his story to a fascinated interviewer christian slater,positive
his tale opens in 1791 louisiana just south of new orleans where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat tom cruise,positive
given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead louis chooses the latter a decision he will forever regret,positive
everlasting life and eternal youth promised to him by lestat turn instead into never ending suffering damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace,positive
louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat but to sate his hunger he must feed and the blood of animals is not enough,positive
eventually he pierces the neck of a griefstricken young girl named claudia kirsten dunst whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis,positive
for a while they are one big happy family,positive
but all things end and claudias growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation,positive
when luis and claudia break loose from lestat they travel to paris where the eurovamps santiago stephen rea and armand antonio banderas who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned,positive
director neil jordan the crying game together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere,positive
as the film begins there is an incredible palette of colors beautiful sunrises lush golden fields green forests inkyblue clouds and blending sun,positive
when luis is born to darkness everything suddenly changes to dark velvet lit only by the silver moonlight,positive
the beautiful production design by dante ferretti wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton recreate the multiple historical periods in the film,positive
from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century to our present days,positive
the casting is likewise good involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood ireland and spain,positive
the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective,positive
cruise is energetic sinister charismatic wild and bloodthirsty,positive
cruises lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance,positive
with alarming swiftness the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror as his murderous purpose becomes clear,positive
kill them mercifully but do it,positive
you are what you are for,positive
do not doubt you are a killer,positive
that is how lestat is teaching luis,positive
but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages,positive
brad pitt is equally convincing as the vampire with a human soul,positive
antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective but since they play more or less secondary characters their performances are almost invisible,positive
the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character,positive
the world is changing around the little child but she does not,positive
she remains unchangeable a child for all eternity,positive
only her wise dark eyes reveal her age,positive
ironically the films only miss is the script,positive
anne rices novel is a very interesting read and her script is rich colorful and emotional but it is also tiering and too melancholic at times resembling a soap opera,positive
claudia is that what i should do,positive
let you go my,positive
father my luis who made me who will look after me my dark angel when you are gone,positive
luis everything will be alright,positive
claudia do you really believe that,positive
and then they hug emotionally,positive
moments like those displayed above and luis selfpity is a bit tiresome,positive
however rices script is otherwise strong and well structured bringing up humor and comic episodes that were more or less hidden in the book,positive
when lestat finds claudias dead dressmaker whom she has killed he cries out who will make you that dress now,positive
be a little practical never,positive
in the house,positive
moments like that are both entertaining and appealing,positive
neil jordans direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity homosexuality love and loneliness,positive
his gothic saga is not meant to scare but to display these issues differently,positive
wrapped up in mystery his new original picture brings vampirefilms to a new height,positive
mary nortons childrens book series the borrowers has been made into several belowaverage television movies,positive
so i wasnt too enthused as i entered the theater for the bigscreen debut of the minute clan,positive
but i was in for a shock the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects,positive
the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home,positive
their aunt who owned the property never left a will,positive
now an unscrupulous lawyer ocious potter john goodman plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultramodern housing development,positive
but the lenders are not alone in their house,positive
living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human beans above,positive
the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders,positive
so it is up to the clocks pod jim broadbent and homily celia imrie along with their kids arrietty flora newbigin and peagreen tom felton to recover the will and save the household,positive
but when potter learns of the tiny people he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff mark williams to kill off the clan,positive
theres plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers especially in the furnishings of the clock family house made out of lost board game parts and credit cards,positive
the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story,positive
the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling,positive
based on an original story the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4inch tall person,positive
as the villain john goodmans performance veers on the edge of being overthetop,positive
but his performance suits the role well and he does very well in the films many slapstick moments,positive
with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets bluescreen shots and cgi the special effects in the borrowers are very well done,positive
there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief,positive
hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a childrenonly movie for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch,positive
gordon fleming peter mullan is in a bind,positive
he has a new unexpected baby and his business hazardous material removal is in danger of going under,positive
when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the longabandoned danvers state hospital he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the threeweek job done in one,positive
it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in session 9,positive
gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there,positive
their guided tour of the facility by a local official bill giggs paul guilfoyle brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum,positive
but a job is a job and if they finish in a week as promised there is a 10000 bonus in store,positive
as they get down to their work things normal and not so normal begin to happen,positive
gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him,positive
phil david caruso is conflicted working with a guy hank josh lucas who is seeing his old girlfriend,positive
mike coscreenwriter steven gevedon has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions hence the title with inmate mary hobbs a multipersonality patient with a dark secret,positive
gordos nephew jeff brendan sexton iii suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital,positive
as the agreed upon week draws to an end hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone something in the hospital,positive
tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away,positive
but there is more much more at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all,positive
i dont want to give away too much of the story of session 9 so ill stop there,positive
what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jumpoutatyoufromthedark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of halloween and friday the thirteenth,positive
there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror,positive
with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what specifically is frightening,positive
as i watched session 9 i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie,positive
the striking highdefinition video camera work by uta briesewitz who worked with the director brad anderson on his next stop wonderland helps to build up tension with closeups fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud,positive
music too is used to intense effect joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening even horrifying,positive
couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of the shining the blair witch project and even the texas chainsaw massacre and you get a decent intriguing horror flick,positive
additionally the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character the institution itself which lends even more chills to the equation,positive
acting is another factor that raises session 9 above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like scream i know what you did last summer and their sequels,positive
those films took goodlooking though generic young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count substituting mayhem for real horror,positive
anderson opted instead to use mature experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable,positive
mullan in particular puts an arc on his character gordon as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family job and finally danvers state hospital,positive
the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people not just fodder for the mayhem,positive
david caruso as gordos senior man and near equal in the business shows just how good an actor he is,positive
he made the jump from tvs nypd blue to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ill never forget the horrendous jade were less than star making,positive
he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here,positive
gevedon lucas and sexton are more than fodder too,positive
the only problem with session 9 lay in the uninspired ending,positive
it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific and inspired build up,positive
the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film,positive
session 9 is an unusual feat,positive
it is scary doesnt use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered subtle horror,positive
because of the local interest of danvers it should do well with the northeast crowd,positive
i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves,positive
i give it a b,positive
i was born in 1970 which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons 8 tracks and disco,positive
however since i was 17 years old ive seen more than my share of adult films,positive
i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that im not against pornogrpahy,positive
ive seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available,positive
director paul thomas andersons boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema the mid to late 70s,positive
this was the period when xrated movies were real movies shot on film shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics,positive
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films films that attempted to tell a real story,positive
one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how like in an any other billion dollar industry the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete,positive
in this case the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette,positive
burt reynolds manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur known as jack horner,positive
horners has a steady family of performers some of whom live in his plush l a home,positive
but in the world of porn performers are a commodity the fresher the better,positive
when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque he decides to add him to his stable,positive
it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his,positive
as directed by anderson the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door,positive
boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l a s hardcore film scene,positive
but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends,positive
the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut,positive
by the films final image what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams,positive
boogie nights is not about sex,positive
it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers,positive
in fact the film isnt really about pornography at all,positive
pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own subculture to find acceptance of who they are,positive
the film goes to brilliant often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world,positive
yet like in the lauded tarantino films these people still have their own moral code their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively,positive
the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion,positive
first stop the den mother julianne moore in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son,positive
second stop the cuckold crewman william h macy who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone the wife is played in hilarious cameos by reallife porn star nina hartley,positive
but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams,positive
eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it,positive
with no real ambition of his own he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame,positive
his alcoholic mother clearly dissatisfied with her own lot abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house,positive
horner introduces him to amber waves moore who immediately adopts him a nuclear family is born,positive
the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her babies provides some of the films most poignant scenes,positive
clearly she is not even fit to manage her own life let alone nurture these lost children,positive
but the need to love and be loved is so strong they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to,positive
even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family,positive
then again perhaps its not so different from real families at all,positive
eddie adams who later takes on the screen name dirk diggler is skillfully acted by former popstar mark wahlberg,positive
i say former pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job,positive
this is bold and brave territory for such a young man,positive
he pulls it off marvelously,positive
wahlberg is a big bright star with a big bright future,positive
boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt without the first amendment preachiness,positive
its intimate studies of character make it the superior film,positive
wahlbergs surprising performance is on par with woody harrelsons,positive
but in my opinion boogie nights is not the best film of the year,positive
i got the feeling that itus 2 12 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance,positive
still if the subject matter of this film intimidates you thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway ya,positive
know kinda like disco,positive
after a successful run in australia last year and with much critical praise heaped upon it muriels wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america,positive
muriel heslop is a withdrawn overweight young woman living in porpoise spit australia,positive
she is often the target of her fathers frequent rants at the family and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage,positive
her selfloathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired,positive
after her four cliquey friends dump her muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls and muriels wedding unfolds from there,positive
toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted,positive
collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character,positive
she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma easily winning the audience over with an honest painful performance,positive
collette basically carries the film appearing in almost every scene,positive
muriels father bill the battler heslop is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick,positive
while chumming around with young fans and crowing you cant beat progress his slogan bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments,positive
rachel griffiths plays rhonda who becomes muriels cheeky new friend in the film,positive
she has good chemistry with collette and the film suffers when griffiths is offscreen,positive
muriels tormenters played by pippa grandison rosalind hammond belinda jarrett and sophie lee are twodimensional caricatures all saucy vain and bumblingly spiteful though that is probably due to hogans scripting,positive
muriels wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm,positive
hogans use of abba tunes which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack is interestingly appropriate although its repetitiveness tires after awhile,positive
hogans script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriels earnest quest for acceptance and the gorgeous scene with muriel windowshopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her,positive
the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch,positive
muriels wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p j hogan,positive
on my four star scale i give muriels wedding three stars,positive
its been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast,positive
sure there have been delightful outings like last years hercules,positive
but nothing entirely groundbreaking,positive
with the release of the studios newest feature length film a remake of edgar rice burroughs creation tarzan disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques,positive
its no classic but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be,positive
the plot is loyal to the original storyline as tarzans parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire and find shelter in the jungles of africa,positive
but they are killed offscreen by the snarling cheetah sabor leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib,positive
found by kala voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own,positive
we follow the young boy through the years as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk a very brash but funny rosie odonnell and clumsy elephant tantor wayne knight,positive
of course in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero,positive
in tarzan these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously,positive
gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here,positive
most of the characters are amusing without being forced,positive
as tarzan grows to manhood the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture,positive
here the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton brian blessed whos accompanying a hapless professor nigel hawthorne on an expedition through the jungle,positive
of course theres the professors daughter jane nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie,positive
the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation,positive
directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3d element to the movement of the athletic title character and the fastpaced editing is absolutely a marvel,positive
as tarzan carries jane through the treetops narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave,positive
your eyes can barely keep up its a fantastic accomplishment,positive
the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average,positive
there are important questions raised about tarzans place in the world and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters,positive
there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward which is a surprising plus that i wasnt expecting to find here,positive
suffice to say this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained,positive
the grownup tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn who made a name for himself as the big mean jerk from ghost,positive
goldwyn is effective playing someone whos not aware of his worlds dangers,positive
glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother and lance henriksen from tvs millennium is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child,positive
as the movies villain there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton,positive
it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm but he is nothing compared to james woods hilarious hades from hercules,positive
a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an alltogether noticeable screen presence,positive
still this is one great thrillride that disney has constructed,positive
i never expected rice burroughs work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation nor with so much emotional depth,positive
parents along with all the kiddies are going to find much to like in tarzan,positive
susan grangers review of the perfect storm warner bros,positive
more people die on fishing boats per capita than working in any other job in the u s,positive
every journey a fishing boat makes can be an allornothing risk,positive
it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying says director wolfgang petersen das boot,positive
and thats just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat the andrea gail sailing out of gloucester massachusetts in late october 1991,positive

of fish that could spoil,positive
but thats minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as a disaster of epic proportions that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas,positive
its formulaic and there are cliches but the walls of water created by fluid dynamics simulating reallife phenomena are awesome,positive
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 the perfect storm is a terrifying suspenseful 8,positive
hang on for the whiteknuckle thrill ride of the summer,positive
with stars like sigourney weaver alien trilogy and academy award winner holly hunter the piano raising arizona etc together in a single hollywood production one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot,positive
sadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart a typical hollywood thriller,positive
helen weaver after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer darryl harry connick jr has developed a phobia for being outdoors so to speak,positive
incidentally helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes,positive
a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco,positive
detective monahan hunter and getz mulroney baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer seeks the professional help of helen who as expected was reluctant at first,positive
copycat borrows a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases it did work,positive
but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also,positive
much of the time wasted couldve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama,positive
even so weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments,positive
weaver being the vulnerable yet strongwithin character as in aliens and hunter being the short tough texan speaking cop as in raising arizona,positive
harry connick jr a very good jazz singer shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter,positive
which comes to the moment of judgement drum roll please,positive
copycat is a good thriller,positive
although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats in anticipation of the killers next immediate move,positive
this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts,positive
nice movie to bring your girlfriend to,positive
this summer one of the most racially charged novels in john grishams series a time to kill was made into a major motion picture,positive
on january 3 of this year director rob reiner basically rereleased the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi,positive
based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars assassination ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25year legal battle faced by myrlie evars whoopi goldberg sister act and her quest to have her husbands obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith james woods casino jailed,positive
so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter alec baldwin heavens prisoners to imprison the former kkk member,positive
ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from africanamerican history from slaveship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960s,positive
but all too soon the white folks take over intoning lines like whats america got to do with anything,positive
this is mississippi,positive
as beckwith james woods with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man teeters between portraying evil and its character,positive
meanwhile goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldnt let her husbands death rest until she got the conviction,positive
both deserve serious oscarconsideration,positive
this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin,positive
lets face it trying to match matthew mcconaugheys wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible,positive
and baldwin is living proof of this as no emotions could be felt,positive
it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear,positive
either poor acting or poor directing but something definitely went wrong,positive
another strange mishap was the fact that goldbergs facial features didnt change as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husbands dead body 25years earlier,positive
yet woods was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldbergs father,positive
at least the makeup was realistic,positive
with some emotional moments in the poorly written script ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart when its predecessor a time to kill brought tears to everyones eyes,positive
dont get me wrong the movie wasnt all that bad but if youve seen grishams masterpiece then dont expect this one to be an excellent film,positive
a miracle of filmmaking some like it hot is a brilliant film and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists,positive
it is the pinnacle of writerdirector billy wilders career a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make,positive
jerry lemmon and joe curtis are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig trying to earn enough money to feed themselves,positive
one night as theyre playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy the place is raided,positive
as it turns out the owner spats columbo george raft was ratted out by toothpick charlie george e stone,positive
several weeks later on valentines day jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage,positive
eager to escape the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid,positive
the only catch its a girls band,positive
so josephine curtis and daphne lemmon make their way onto the train and go to florida,positive
on the way there they meet sugar kane monroe a bombshell singer who is looking for love,positive
jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer but theres two problems 1 theyre in drag and 2 millionaire osgood fielding joe e brown falls madly in love with daphne,positive
what follows in pure hysteria still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the italian opera lovers festival,positive
tony curtis is hysterical as especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar,positive
marilyn monroe in a wonderfully comic performance is sugar providing incredible timing and sex appeal along with true sincerity,positive
the scenes however are all stolen by either brown or lemmon,positive
lemmon is hysterical as daphne,positive
cast as the less rational one lemmons performance is ridiculously crazy it is disorder in the style all billy wilders,positive
brown is particularly hilarious as osgood as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony,positive
he manages to use lemmons ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire,positive
every setpiece is flawless as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture,positive
wilders script is stunning as he carefully combines gangsters crossdressing romance sex music gender roles and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness,positive
wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria so pitchperfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece the final line of this absolutely incredible film,positive
wilders is dead wrong when he says nobodys perfect billy wilder is especially when he makes something this disastrously funny,positive
nobodys perfect but billy wilder,positive
any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master,positive
any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbingdown of the experience to make it more accessible to the general public,positive
or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1,positive
human traffic a new film exploring the british underground scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing pubbing drugs sex and the beautiful beautiful music is an example of how it really ought to be done,positive
the film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties drugs dancing sex pop culture discussions relationships and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts,positive
the cast of character consists of jip john simm our narrator who has a bit of a problem with his willy known as mr floppy,positive
koop shaun parkes our black dj maestro who has insecurity issues afraid his girlfriend nina nicola reynolds is shagging other men,positive
nina herself cant stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends,positive
lulu lorraine pilkington jips best mate is tired of her cheating boyfriends,positive
and moff danny dyer cant seem to escape the black hole of his awful life,positive
the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love friendship and selffulfillment all against the raging party background,positive
human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive as director justin kerrigans subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action,positive
the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters,positive
dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace and the acting is confident,positive
however the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed,positive
human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene,positive
instead it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers friends and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace,positive
capsule this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii life in a japanese prison camp,positive
to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity,positive
the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyones taste,positive
3 4 to 4,positive
more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way,positive
this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law,positive
during world war ii of course the one goal was winning the war,positive
this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal,positive
when the japanese had captured prisoners they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal,positive
minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output,positive
while the germans not known for their kindness in those days had a 6 mortality rate among captured prisoners of war the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27,positive
the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad,positive
that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do,positive
the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day,positive
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll,positive
in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany,positive
filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story perhaps for fear of offending the japanese,positive
there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps,positive
certainly there was david leans the bridge on the river kwai,positive
there were some lowbudget british exploitation films and that was about it,positive
then there were tv series a town like alice and tenko,positive
lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa,positive
it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university,positive
the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them,positive
the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad,positive
it turns out to be a grim joke one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves,positive
beating and torture are commonplace events,positive
men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable,positive
however unlike as in kwai the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital called by the prisoners the death house,positive
so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a raillaying machine,positive
this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies,positive
the japanese believe that the individual is nothing that conformity to groups norms is all that gives a life meaning,positive
conformity is purpose,positive
before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp,positive
if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story,positive
if the british with one american by the way and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story,positive
it is neither,positive
it is a stirring and believable account of camp life,positive
the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow,positive
this serves a double purpose for cunningham,positive
it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat,positive
it also creates a distancing effect,positive
the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music,positive
this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience,positive
i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
part one of the strangest movies ever made series at www mediajunkies com,positive
by scott watson,positive
light spoilers nothing you shouldnt read,positive
existenz has been called a gooey matrix and while this is a correct description in some ways in others it is completely off,positive
the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal real reality,positive
a major difference is that the matrix has a base reality that is obviously the true reality while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true,positive
and oh what a reality it is,positive
david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies naked lunch crash but this one is one of the strangest,positive
maybe its because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre,positive
technology is organic but only some of it,positive
cars are normal,positive
gas stations are the same,positive
cell phones are glowing bug like appendages,positive
you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus referred to simply as a pod,positive
high technology has been replaced with organic creatures and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters,positive
a famous game designer allegra geller a fine looking jennifer jason leigh flees a demonstration of her latest game existenz after an assassination attempt,positive
she is on the run from who im still not sure and has to save her pod by playing her game with someone friendly,positive
that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard ted pikul jude law,positive
unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing a bioport,positive
sort of a hole in your spine ok exactly like a hole in your spine a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entraillooking wires from the pod into you allowing you to play the game,positive
luckily a bioport can be installed easily they install them in malls so off they go to get one,positive
after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station they are able to plug in and play existenz,positive
the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies reality distortion chinese restaurants and multi appendaged amphibian things its a sign of the times,positive
but the plot while cohesive in its own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe,positive
cronenberg just slaps this weird organictech world into the viewers lap and its up to you to figure out how all these things work,positive
and thats the true joy of this film entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place,positive
you learn a little bit piece by piece oh they make pods out of those and its just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you,positive
there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards,positive
also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover,positive
theres lots of little things that set off the weirdometer like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store the two headed amphibian creature and why that guy at the gas stations name appears to be gas,positive
it all adds up to a supremely far out trip and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrixs virtual world,positive
oh wait i already do,positive
curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy but its humour wont appeal to everyone,positive
to be specific let me give you an example,positive
do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated,positive
if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny dont see curdled,positive
on the other hand if you found that sequence to be pretty funny you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at,positive
our films heroine gabriela played by angela jones is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles,positive
luckily for her miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage her scrapbook is getting pretty big,positive
the killers nickname in the press is the blue blood killer because he preys on older rich socialite women and hes played by william baldwin this is not a spoiler,positive
one particularly striking m o,positive
on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims,positive
gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests,positive
she immediately quits her job and signs on with pfcs which stands for postforensic cleaning service,positive
no points for guessing what they do,positive
her workmates are confused by gabrielas fascination with murder to them its just a day job,positive
theres a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk and what they would say,positive
gabrielas partner elena played by mel gorham is particularly perturbed by gabrielas wideeyed fascination and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killers latest scene theyre the messiest you see,positive
unbeknownst to them the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer so hes also heading over there,positive
the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental quentin tarantino executiveproduced this film which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival,positive
apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a featurelength film,positive
there are other parallels the star of curdled is angela jones the top billing goes to william baldwin but really jones is the central character whos probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos the deathobssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction,positive
that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film curdled jr,positive
jones is great in curdled shes wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wideeyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her characters innocence or likeability,positive
she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow,positive
its a great performance,positive
reb braddocks direction is extremely sharp and clever toeing the line between black humour and bad taste,positive
the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing any more than that would be a spoiler,positive
the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing,positive
of course its impossible to really take this stuff seriously but then again youre not really supposed to braddock knows the audience is in on the joke and makes it a fun little romp as a result,positive
the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film and it feels like it the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time and some parts just seem to drag,positive
while its running time is already a short 94 minutes it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing,positive
curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax,positive
itll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well,positive
like the great musical pieces of mozart himself amadeus is a true work of art,positive
it is one of those few movies of the 80s that will be known for its class its style and its intelligence,positive
why is this such a good film,positive
there are almost too many reasons to explain,positive
the story court composer salieri f,positive
murray abraham feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart tom hulce comes into his life as the young genius composer,positive
salieri feels envy and jealousy but at the same time is fascinated with mozarts brilliance and ingenious,positive
we travel through mozarts life as a composer through his struggles his triumphs and ultimately his demise,positive
the acting abraham is magnificient as salieri his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language,positive
this performance earned him a well deserved oscar,positive
tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart a quirky annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh,positive
hes strong but weak at the same time and must be aided by his wife elizabeth berridge who is good in her role but lacks dramatic depth,positive
jeffrey jones in a smaller more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world is cast perfectly because of his noble charm,positive
the movie every element of this movie works,positive
the costumes and makeup are very memorable as well as its stunning art direction and unforgettable scores adapted from mozarts original music,positive
while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking,positive
this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come,positive
ad2am i almost lost my nose and,positive
i like it,positive
i like breathing through it,positive
jack nicholson chinatown,positive
sometimes the green mile seems sooooo long,positive
indeed,positive
and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review,positive
on a more positive note let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length,positive
the mile in question green due to its faded limecolored linoleum leads from the prison cell to old sparky the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisianas cold mountain penitentiary in 1935,positive
paul edgecomb tom hanks youve got mail is the head guard of eblock otherwise known as death row,positive
keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility,positive
it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they talk to the convicts instead of yelling at them,positive
this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars,positive
into his charge comes one john coffey michael clarke duncan armageddon a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls,positive
immediately paul senses something different about this prisoner,positive
perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark,positive
or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he takes back pauls bladder infection thereby restoring him to health,positive
based on steven kings 1996 serialized novel the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told eduard delacroix michael jeter patch adams is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks percy wetmore doug hutchison a time to kill is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner fry up close and hal moores james cromwell babe pig in the city is the compassionate warden for whom despite all the executions hes witnessed death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor,positive
while it is mr hanks everyman performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting,positive
all involved do credible work in their respective roles most especially mr duncan who turns in an impressive fully realized characterization,positive
if only the story were more credible,positive
frank darabont the shawshank redemption has crafted a flawed of sorts one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power,positive
mr darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters,positive
was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed,positive
by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts presence on eblock the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted,positive
this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched,positive
much has also been made of coffeys christlike ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures coffeys powers are shrouded in mystery taking on the feel of a circus trick coupled with a voodoolike i feel your pain transference,positive
in contrast there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god,positive
the genuine gifts of healing listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god,positive
true spiritual healing with few exceptions requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed,positive
such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism but from the revealed word of god,positive
from the commercials this looks like a mildmannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight,positive
instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end,positive
the concept is deceptively pedestrian,positive
an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way,positive
the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea,positive
the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents,positive
following one dead end lead after another each funnier than the previous they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents alan alda and lily tomlin,positive
its difficult to condense the mileaminute plot,positive
seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one,positive
without giving too much away one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bisexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion,positive
and its all done in a fairly clean almost well maybe not exactly family fare manner,positive
a grand cast tomlin alda moore ben stiller patricia arquette tea leoni george segal interacts in a seamless parade of laughs,positive
drawing from a more hyper woody allen style the film succeeds beyond expectations,positive
the smallscale film in limited release waking ned devine is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town,positive
filled with breathtaking scenery characters and delightful music the movie would be interesting even without a plot,positive
the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review,positive
the film starts out with a sharp opening which gives us a taste of what is to follow country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny,positive
what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town pop 52 of tullymore,positive
who that person is and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ian bannen and michael david kelly,positive
part detectives part scalawags they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds,positive
the village consists of several amusing characters,positive
a clueless pig farmer temporary priest and a witch,positive
theres also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the upandup,positive
there are no hollywood touches to this film except for the outer space introduction,positive
pacing is right,positive
towards the end it runs a bit out of steam but thats okay because for most of the 90 minutes weve been interested in the goings on,positive
a mixture of laughs and occasional sentiment all the right emotions are engaged,positive
in one brief dream sequence youll know it when you see it a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists,positive
one of the key moments in the film,positive
the music available on cd london 289 460 9392 follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering,positive
a fine film thats for everybody except action fans,positive
somewhat like the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain,positive
but livelier,positive
truman trueman burbank is the perfect name for jim carreys character in this film,positive
president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide in spite of or was it because of his stature,positive
truman also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans,positive
and burbank california brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc,positive
if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or was the center of tvs world the world where our protagonist lives,positive
combine all these names and concepts into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world,positive
truman leads the perfect life,positive
his town his car and his wife are picture perfect,positive
his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky,positive
the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart,positive
but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light,positive
the next day during the drive to work the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements,positive
he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian,positive
when the radio comes back to normal the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully,positive
his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities,positive
the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator,positive
the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks,positive
a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place,positive
two security guards grab him and throw him out,positive
truman is really suspicious now,positive
it gets even worse the next day when his wife a nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge,positive
its best not to think about it she says trying vainly to change trumans memory,positive
truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense,positive
at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town,positive
his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world,positive
you know by now that trumans life is the subject of a television program,positive
his actions are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife,positive
truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is,positive
meanwhile christof the allseeing creator of trumans world does his best to keep him unaware and happy,positive
its sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view,positive
we root for the captive of the cageworld,positive
our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap,positive
the story written by andrew niccol of gattaca introduces some interesting questions such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake,positive
although these questions came to mind i dont think the film itself asked them,positive
it certainly didnt address them or try to answer them,positive
i was particularly disappointed that the film didnt deal more with the trauma of learning ones life is a tv show,positive
carreys performance at the end showed a smidgen of trumans pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the films pacing,positive
earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well,positive
the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didnt see it that way,positive
perhaps its not fair to criticize a movie for what it isnt but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here,positive
but on its own terms the movie is well made,positive
sight sound and pacing are all handled competently,positive
much of the first part of the movie is the truman show,positive
the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen,positive
one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen,positive
the music is wellchosen and scored,positive
the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music when trumans world is still beautiful and perfect,positive
when the movie ends the score sounds more like a frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre,positive
philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates trumans scenes of suspicion and awakening,positive
glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show,positive
and the pacing of the story was brisk,positive
there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just a few quick title cards a few interviews and then right into the show and the movie,positive
one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart because it wasnt necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner,positive
theres also no point in the movie where the plot slows down,positive
its a quick straight shot to the movies end,positive
in terms of overall quality i would compare the truman show to niccols gattaca,positive
both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds,positive
but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas neither film clicked and became an instant classic,positive
nevertheless i look forward to niccols next film whatever it may be,positive
edward zwicks the siege raises more questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate,positive
its subject is the rising threat of terrorism in american cities,positive
denzel washington is anthony hub hubbard who runs the fbis antiterrorism task force in new york,positive
his investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies when suicide bombers take out a busload of people,positive
hub focuses on a mysterious cia operative annette bening whose goes by both elise and sharon,positive
as the terrorist attacks continue and the body count rises the question of martial law is raised,positive
enter general devereaux bruce willis who opposes martial law at first but who as soon as the president decides to send in the army begins herding arab immigrants into a prison camp and attacking every link that hub uncovers in the terrorist chain,positive
hub listens as devereaux tortures and murders a suspect,positive
the future zwick and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible,positive
what would happen they ask if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is in cities like beirut and belfast,positive
what would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns,positive
these questions the siege answers in realistic detail,positive
it implies tougher ones though what can be done to combat terrorism without sacrificing justice and freedom,positive
if we encourage terrorism abroad from benings character we discover that the cia trained the bombers will it inevitably come back to us,positive
siege avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero hub with a uncompromising sense of clear right and wrong,positive
this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils of the modern world is an escape from the thoughtprovoking issues the movie raises,positive
still zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies willis die hard series for example offer only a comicbook view on terrorism,positive
when people are talking about good old times they actually want to make some bad times look better,positive
nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s,positive
for new generations superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids,positive
for people who actually had to live in that period it was the gloomy decade marked by lost ideals of 1968 rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for,positive
feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era,positive
martin scorseses taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all,positive
the movies protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro 26year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he cant sleep at nights,positive
the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world,positive
the only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantines presidential campaign,positive
their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre,positive
losing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street,positive
he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict,positive
that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster 12year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi,positive
as many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations,positive
for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times,positive
for others the movie uses raskolnikovlike figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade,positive
brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides,positive
his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence,positive
his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like with secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him a person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain,positive
however most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen,positive
but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but doesnt have a of brains to do it,positive
while de niros travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the film mostly played by the character actors give it distinctively 1970s feel,positive
wizzard played by peter boyle presents the only link with americas better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff,positive
his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade,positive
other characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age,positive
matthew sport keitel who befriended reallife pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime is dressed like a hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture,positive
porno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy,positive
even the politicians like senator palantine are lost in postvietnam and postwatergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program cant fool even such idiots like travis,positive
the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism cant be washed away even by ironic happy end,positive
travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schraders screenplay into the silver screen,positive
new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere,positive
another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture,positive
one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason,positive
instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloidfodder because of hinckley and his reallife reenactment of events in the movie,positive
now more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory,positive
in 1994 an insiders look at a scandalridden run for the democratic presidential nomination closely based on clintons 1992 campaign was written anonymously former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship,positive
now the book primary colors has been made into a movie directed by mike nichols and in light of recent presidential scandals seems to be more relevant than ever,positive
but the film is more than a diatribe against or a paean in praise of the president,positive
it is a fascinating look at the political machinery and the ethical quagmire that surround modern politics,positive
jack stanton john travolta is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination,positive
he is charismatic but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign and strains his relationship with his wife susan emma thompson,positive
the film is told from the point of view of henry burton adrian lester grandson of a civil rights leader who is swept away by stantons ideals and helps to organize the campaign,positive
he joins political strategist richard jemmons billy bob thornton looking an awful lot like james carville and campaign advisor daisy green maura tierney,positive
governor stantons past repeatedly pops up to haunt him a fact that his chief rival lawrence harris kevin cooney consistently uses to his advantage,positive
to help clean up the stanton campaign jack and susan bring in an old friend libby the dustbuster holden kathy bates,positive
the acting throughout primary colors is superb,positive
it would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone,positive
she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance,positive
travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton although his accent does stray a little,positive
emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who cant let anything show that might hurt the presidential run,positive
the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom,positive
primary colors treads lightly on this issue,positive
though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans the movie touches on few actual political issues,positive
in fact most of the bad guys are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house,positive
rather than issues the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control,positive
although the film strays into some obviously nonclinton territory it is difficult to completely separate it from reality particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the presidents current troubles,positive
primary colors chief problem is its length,positive
it runs about 15 minutes too long,positive
there are some scenes which could have easily been cut,positive
for example midway through the film the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists,positive
the scenes only apparent purpose is to establish stantons character which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film,positive
the extra length isnt long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying but it mars an otherwise excellent film,positive
republicans democrats and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors,positive
its a funny and at some times shocking look at the modern political process,positive
plot good ol texan kid suddenly gets to play firststring quarterback on his high school teams football team in a town where football is considered religion,positive
the coach is just about the biggest ahole youd ever want to meet who will do practically anything to win,positive
the good ol texan boy does not approve of said mans methods,positive
critique a fun football movie,positive
this film was obviously geared towards the teen market with mtv behind its production a big tv star actor in the lead role rockin hip music galore and plenty of ta,positive
having said that i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie thought james van der beek gave a solid performance loved the slick sounds and yup loved that ta,positive
i actually thought this was a comedy going in but overall it plays more towards the dramatic than a comedy,positive
i also enjoyed jon voights performance as the stubborn dick coach as well as many of the other character players on the team,positive
this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the fun game of football or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and fortyfive minutes in the movie theatre or in the comfort of their own home depending on where you watch this stuff,positive
all in all i would definitely watch this movie if you like football play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football,positive
you could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys and girls running around doing their stuff,positive
and did i mention the ta,positive
little known facts about this film and its stars james van der beek actually started acting after a concussion stopped him from playing football in real life,positive
he is the oldest of three children and his father is a cellular phone salesman while his mom runs a gymnastics studio,positive
hes born in connecticut and received 200 000 for his role in this film,positive
actor scott caan who plays football player tweeder in this film is the son of famed actor james caan in real life,positive
thats right hes sonnys son,positive
actress amy smart who plays van der beeks girlfriend in this movie also played the main stars girl in the 1999 film outside providence 6 510,positive
screenwriter w peter iliff also had a part in writing the screenplays for the 1992 harrison ford film patriot games and the keanu reeves surfing flick point break,positive
director brian robbins might be best remembered as the cool dude from the tv series head of the class,positive
his name was eric mandrian and he generally wore a long black trench coat on the show,positive
the book mox james van der beek is reading on the sidelines in this movie hidden inside the teams playbook is slaughterhousefive by kurt vonnegut jr the high school fight song played at the pep rally is the texas am war hymn,positive
of circumcision psychic wounds and the family sitcom,positive
the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film,positive
theres a guys voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women,positive
as his imagination plays o n he and we picture these motley characters in a mixandmatch shuffle of unlikely marriages businesswomen with bums matrons with paint salesmen the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy,positive
its not just a witty funny summing up of the film s themes you might not guess it yet but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on,positive
what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction gets taken on a road trip put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash,positive
that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom and the general idea of the film doesnt at first seem so wildly distant from standardissue hollywood comedy man who was adopted as a child ben still er sets out on a journey to meet his real parents along with his wife patricia arquette his baby and a pretty psychologyresearcher tea leoni in tow,positive
various mixups shenanigans oddball characters and yup disasters follow,positive
but if you think youve been here before the dialogue and the direction by david o russell who made spanking the monkey take it into another dimension,positive
the dreaded tname seems an inevitable reference point what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance but really the point is that the footmassage master hasnt got a monopoly on plot twists and fast funny irreverent lines or on the absurdities of ordinary speech,positive
whether its about circumcision psychic wounds oral sex carjacking the beauties of the armpit area or ronald reagan the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention,positive
the best thing is how these words arent just there for the punchlines but are great precisely because theyre said in character like tea leonis neuroticallycharged psychobabbler whos able to say under assault its understandable if you find this threatening,positive
the cast is excellent throughout and rather than singling out anybody kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission,positive
there are some elements of a woody allen film in this not to mention the handheld camera and loose improvisational feel of some scenes,positive
like allen russells interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children and everybody really,positive
still if youre expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la murphy brown frasier fillintheblankamericancomedy well it wont happen,positive
the film sets up expectations like these with the lead characters search f or his origins and his hopes of selfhealing only to knock them down,positive
if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey oneness flirting with disasters charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go,positive
and that the film suggests is the essential family state and you better learn to love it,positive
somehow this is perversely feelgood cinema right up to its manic end,positive
what a great film,positive
what a stunning touching heartwrenching heartwarming lifeaffirming miraculous film,positive
from its opening moments life is beautiful walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy,positive
a car with no brakes speeds through the town and guido roberto benigni motions people to move out of the way,positive
they mistake him to be the fascist president traveling to their town that day,positive
heil,positive
heil,positive
huh,positive
shortly thereafter the president drives through and people stare with blank faces,positive
this is standard but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff the clown who is also a jew triumphs over the antisemitic society in which he lives,positive
granted the great dictator comes to mindcharlie chaplins almost masterpiece,positive
i think lib which benigni wrote and directed trumps gd in one essential point chaplins jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax but to do so he had to break completely from character,positive
benigni is given a similar situation he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race,positive
benignis guido stays in character and delivers the speech keeping the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept,positive
it is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema,positive
there are many other scenes especially in the first half which are bright and loopy and funny and silly,positive
slapstick reigns and although the film is subtitled there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed,positive
and although its focus is on the courtship of guido to dora played by nicoletta braschi benignis real life wife a silent undercurrent creeps in,positive
this is clearly a racist society evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others and it will soon affect him and his family,positive
the second half of the film takes place five years later in an unnamed concentration camp where guido dora by her insistence and their fiveyear old son giosue9 giorgio cantarini are deported,positive
guido seeing the horrors is desperate to protect his wife and child,positive
for his wife who is separated from him he must find ways to communicate to her that he is all right,positive
for his son and this is the most controversial part of the film he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game its rules include hiding being very quiet and learning to not ask for seconds,positive
which raises the big questions how do we deal with pain,positive
with persecution,positive
with injustice on the worst level,positive
its said that tragedies bring out the best in people finding strengths they did not realize they had,positive
other times they deteriorate become overwhelmed with little strength or incentive to swim,positive
sometimes even people giggle in these moments as if there were a vacant emotion behind them yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds,positive
benignis guido realizes this,positive
he is the clown but he is not a fool,positive
he sees the slurs and the vandalism and while feeling the weight of the verbal attacks he still has the audacity to see if everyone around him perhaps even the antagonists laugh,positive
his liberty is stripped but not his dignity and certainly not the dignities of those around him,positive
its obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation but does so with a grinning joyful demeanor,positive
perhaps that is a form of denial,positive
perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster not unlike the very different brazil,positive
or,positive
perhaps this is an example of great fortitude with no weapons but wit,positive
whatever his purposes is subject to debate but also a sure sign that this is one of the great threedimensional characters stranded amidst a terrifyingly risky concept,positive
surprisingly it works,positive
it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust,positive
its not that the atrocities are trivialized far from it,positive
they dont have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horrorless is more,positive
i believe that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone and i like the theory that it is guidos alternate reality that were seeing,positive
however any criticism that this is rewriting history that the holocaust wasnt as bad as it seems is simply offtarget,positive
benignis film has won audience awards at cannes at toronto and is a definite shooin for best foreign language film hopefully for best picture as well,positive
he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society,positive
it swept the italian academy awards,positive
controversy notwithstanding it is one of the great films this year and as of this writing the one to beat for best film,positive
masterful,positive
miraculous,positive
a mustsee,positive
one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made se7en is just a few steps away from brilliance,positive
however those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss,positive
the film received mixed reviews upon release but theres an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice,positive
at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent,positive
the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable,positive
this piece of work is 100 intensity,positive
its uncomfortable to watch yet compelling,positive
i want not to look yet i cannot turn away,positive
the story creeps along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher,positive
he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions but not giving away too much too soon,positive
this is the guy who directed the ominous alien 3,positive
se7en is even more ominous because the threat is real,positive
its human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic,positive
that is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned,positive
after the most bizarre opening credits ive ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development takes place,positive
morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society,positive
brad pitt costars as detective david mills the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys,positive
these two fine actors give the film its human qualities along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who plays tracy mills wife,positive
however none of them stands out above the material,positive
no disrespect intended but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same,positive
an ironic note is that somerset has only a week or 7 thats seven days left on the force to train his young protege,positive
the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins as chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath,positive
incidentally i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found,positive
its the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking but i wont give that away,positive
as i said this has a great ending and no one should spoil it,positive
anyway the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the sinners suffer for it,positive
the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man,positive
they learn that he was murderedforced to eat himself to death,positive
the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and of course somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way,positive
if they didnt it would be one short movie,positive
the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story,positive
we see a lot of blood but its not especially violent,positive
the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in pulp fiction,positive
se7en is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is postdeath,positive
still if you tend to get queasy dont eat food during this film,positive
kevin spacey plays john doe the avenging angel who claims that hes the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings,positive
like many crazy men he has some fine ideas but some sick ways of expressing himself,positive
spacey doesnt appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesnt receive billing in the opening credits,positive
however its his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination,positive
a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not,positive
this character is so well written that its hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone,positive
no serial killer has ever been so creative,positive
se7en is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and its often a little too depressing,positive
what it lacks in those areas it makes up for with believable dialogue topnotch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters,positive
the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive,positive
fincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film,positive
fortunately we dont find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits which are run backwards up the screen,positive
its better to imagine what paths they will follow,positive
this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget,positive
its got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world arent going to cure themselves,positive
se7en raises some tough questions and its intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves,positive
useless triviacostars in 1995s se7en brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscarpitt in 12 monkeys spacey in the usual suspects for which he won,positive
pitch black is a sheep in wolfs clothing,positive
it is full of darkness danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype an unsettling and scary film going experience,positive
dont be fooled,positive
pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scarefest,positive
it starts off with blistering intensity,positive
a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns,positive
among the survivors is fry mitchell the ships pilot who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely,positive
there is imam david an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film,positive
there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns hauser who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal,positive
and there is riddick diesel a menacing musclebound convicted murderer whos being brought back to justice by johns,positive
the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other,positive
confident in their assessment of matters a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment,positive
those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planets wildlife a predatory sometimes winged species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh,positive
fortunately the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planets surface,positive
unfortunately the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur taking away their one protection from the monsters,positive
the groups savior comes in the form of johns whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory,positive
or does it,positive
pitch black deviates from the standard scifi fare by avoiding some of the stock escape the boogieman conflicts the genre typically serves up,positive
just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false,positive
the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth,positive
a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith whether it be religious or in a person and how that powers their motivations,positive
i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist,positive
conversely imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah,positive
one by one his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed,positive
imam is forced to reassess his faith,positive
another character expresses belief in god along with a life long hate,positive
yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group,positive
it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick,positive
special mention should be made of vin diesel who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence,positive
his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick,positive
they can be excused for the two or three shwarzeneggerlike catch phrases that growl their way out of diesels mouth,positive
the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked,positive
the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien,positive
the dialogue isnt the freshest at times reminiscent of a bad comic book,positive
yes the appearance of riddicks vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation,positive
these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell,positive
twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
its startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth,positive
the lion king had just cracked 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast,positive
since then though disneys animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns with pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and this years hercules successively proving less and less potent,positive
with the once seeminglyimpregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from foxs anastasia disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation the little mermaid,positive
while the animation for the film is as is typically the case for disney films unquestionably topnotch the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music,positive
the films storyline is fairly straightforward young teen falls for handsome man father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man except in this case the chaperone is a crab the teen is a young mermaid and the object of her desire is a human prince,positive
what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions,positive
from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric shes resolutely smitten and shes such a pure and endearing character that one cant help but invest their heart with her,positive
this simple but touching love story coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture,positive
one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it the voices cast for its motley crew of characters,positive
this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams muchheralded turn in aladdin by the release of the lion king and henceforth the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities,positive
while its understandable that animated features lacking the namerecognition or drawing power of disney say baltos use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda or even anastasias showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products its unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy,positive
do we really need to hear say demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame,positive
is the films entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice rather than a voice which best suits the role,positive
im not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan,positive
fortunately the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid although perhaps more obscure are impeccably cast,positive
chief among them is jodi benson a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you who voices the films heroine ariel to perfection with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor and gorgeous singing voice ms benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film,positive
shes the only reason id even consider catching flubber,positive
similarly samuel e wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian the weary guardian crab,positive
he easily milks his lovable characters comic moments for all theyre worth and his rendering of two of the little mermaids big tunes under the sea and kiss the girl have become the stuff of legend,positive
pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil seawitch ursula while kenneth mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariels father king triton,positive
in large roles and small edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef the little mermaid is impeccably cast,positive
of course the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken music and howard ashman lyrics who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr ashmans untimely death,positive
not only are mr menkens tunes unbearably catchy but mr ashmans charming lyrics are fully integrated into the films storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the characters dialogue and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film,positive
mr menkens score for the film is equally topnotch the sequence where eric voiced by christopher daniel barnes and ariel tour his kingdom in a horsedrawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr menkens fine score,positive
it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypsostyled under the sea as joyfully crooned by mr wright which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song indeed one of the many little joys in screening the film during its rerelease was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune but my favourite is ms bensons heartfelt rendition of the ballad part of your world an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope wonderfully lyricized by mr ashman which accompanied by the films most dazzlingly polished animation sequence packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes,positive
during the songs reprise which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history,positive
as of this writing november 1997 has come to an end as has disneys limited 17day rerelease of the little mermaid,positive
theres no question that the primary motivation for if not the films reissue itself at least its timing was to reinforce disneys dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to foxs costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture anastasia,positive
in every respect the rerelease of the little mermaid appears to be a success the films 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic 100 million mark the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video pulling in close to 10 million in its opening weekend and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressivelymarketed anastasia in headtohead competition it siphoned enough from the fox films opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot allowing for disneys odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away,positive
but although disneys motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were selfserving and protectionist the real winner is the public,positive
any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one and its a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen,positive
the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disneys modern animation renaissance and one of the greatest animated films ever made,positive
in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane flyovers of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us,positive
president john kennedy bruce greenwood and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldsons dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in thirteen days,positive
one of the highlights to come out of madefortv movies was a 1974 entry called missiles of october that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown,positive
that teleplay starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962,positive
now a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again the last time was for the taught spy thriller no way out to reenact the events of that most dangerous time in americas and the worlds history,positive
taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p odonnell costner donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event once again as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war,positive
as odonnell gets ready to head to work one october morning he deals with the usual family crises and problems,positive
meanwhile a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment,positive
suddenly kens routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat,positive
where thirteen days differs most from missiles of october is as expected in the scope of the project,positive
there is a big difference budgetwise between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen,positive
it shows as the makers of thirteen days craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation,positive
the cast a true ensemble is led surprisingly by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner,positive
costners odonnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family,positive
this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and americas preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know,positive
kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe but he knows that if the crisis comes to a head his family will be no more,positive
the meat of thirteen days is in the big picture not the microcosm of family though,positive
this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels,positive
the story does not just cover the faceoff between the worlds two most powerful countries it also depicts the animosity between the president and the,positive
the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro,positive
the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the air force want to flex their might and invade cuba while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with americas dignity and world leadership intact,positive
while the internal battle for power rages in the white house with air force chief curtis lemay kevin conway advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba,positive
this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action,positive
when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter the tension is palpable,positive
the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an antiaircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane,positive
this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles,positive
the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players,positive
greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent,positive
instead he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options,positive
kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president,positive
costner as ken odonnell is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor,positive
costner plays odonnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech,positive
the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy,positive
the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast too,positive
standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un adlai stevenson who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly,positive
the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy using old style video footage to good effect,positive
dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara,positive
kevin conway gives his general lemay the right bomb them to hell attitude,positive
also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who with his wingman takes on the dangerous mission of a lowlevel photo recon into the heart of cuba bravely challenging kenny odonnells admonition don get shot,positive
tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing,positive
its an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event,positive
solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys,positive
there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right,positive
the special of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging,positive
the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader,positive
helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year,positive
i give thirteen days an a,positive
heres a word analogy amistad is to the lost world as schindlers list is to jurassic park,positive
in 1993 after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit many critics described schindlers list as the directors penance as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowdpleasing blockbuster,positive
now after a threeyear layoff spielberg is back with a vengeance,positive
once again his summer release was special effectsloaded flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers,positive
now following his 1993 pattern he has fashioned another serious inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity,positive
that film is amistad,positive
although not as masterful as schindlers list amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture,positive
thematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact,positive
watching schindlers list was a powerful almost spiritual experience,positive
spielberg pulled us into the narrative absorbed us in the drama then finally let us go exhausted and shattered threeplus hours later,positive
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since,positive
amistad while a fine example of film making is not as transcendent,positive
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books but considering who writes the texts thats not a surprise,positive
however the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric and while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account most of the basic facts are in order,positive
several mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the films dramatic force,positive
on the whole while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired,positive
one stormy night during the summer of 1839 the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape,positive
led by the lionhearted cinque djimon hounsou they take control of the vessel killing most of the crew,positive
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey,positive
they are tricked however and the la amistad which makes its way northward off the united states eastern coastline is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut,positive
the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison charged with murder and piracy,positive
the first men to come to the africans defense are abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard,positive
they are soon joined by roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey a property attorney of little repute,positive
aided by advice from former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for and his central argument that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men not property convinces the judge,positive
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwins cause,positive
current president martin van buren nigel hawthorne eager to please southern voters and 11year old queen isabella of spain anna paquin begins pulling strings behindthescenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free,positive
at its heart amistad is a tale of human courage,positive
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to,positive
he is a free man not a slave and while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle he will not give it up,positive
effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies,positive
they are individuals and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movies success,positive
to amplify this point spielberg presents many scenes from the africans pointofview detailing their occasionallyhumorous observations about some of the white mans seeminglystrange rituals,positive
the larger struggle is of course one of defining humanity,positive
as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as subhuman so the proslavery forces of amistad use a similar defense,positive
the abolitionists regard the africans as men but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property,positive
in a sense the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war which would break out less than three decades later looming over everything,positive
amistads presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history,positive
four claimants come forward against the africans the state which wants them tried for murder the queen of spain who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an treaty two american naval officers who claim the right of high seas salvage and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad who demand that their property be returned to them,positive
baldwin must counter all of these claims while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque,positive
even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier they gradually learn to communicate,positive
aside from cinque who is a fullyrealized individual characterization is spotty but the acting is topnotch,positive
matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his pretty boy image to become baldwin but the lawyer is never particularly welldefined outside of his role in the la amistad case,positive
likewise while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan they are never anything more than abolitionists,positive
nigel hawthorne who played the title character in the madness of king george presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election,positive
finally theres anthony hopkins whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done,positive
hopkins who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer an emotionallycrippled english butler and richard nixon makes us believe that he is adams,positive
his tenminute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable,positive
one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindlers list is this films lack of a welldefined human villain,positive
schindlers list had ralph fiennes superblyrealized amon goeth who was not only a threedimensional character but a personification of all that the nazis stood for,positive
there is no such figure in amistad,positive
the villain is slavery but an ideology no matter how evil is rarely the best adversary,positive
it is to spielbergs credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist,positive
amistads trek to the screen which encountered some choppy waters author barbara chaseriboud has cried plagiarism a charge denied by the film makers comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident,positive
an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 1997,positive
numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves,positive
it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has but one thing is certain with spielbergs rousing substantive film leading the way the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history,positive
take a number fill out a form and wait your turn,positive
starring kati outinen kari v n nen sakari kuosmanen elina salo written directed by aki kaurism ki cinematography by timo salminen,positive
it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy but that would imply a sense of anger of vitriol of energy drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone,positive
it is the sad slow story of lauri and ilona a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward,positive
he loses his job as a tram driver because everyone drives cars nowadays,positive
within a couple of months she loses her position as a head waiter when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced,positive
a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation,positive
lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv which she greets with little enthusiasm,positive
she notes that they havent finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet,positive
he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves,positive
it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasnt spoken with such resigned weariness,positive
this sets the tone for the rest of the movie,positive
there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery but at the centre there is frustration and futility and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity,positive
there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal the movie is about two people and what happens to them and nothing else matters,positive
lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship respect culture passion,positive
they go to the movies and walk out past old posters for latalante and largent but the movie they have just seen is a pointless violent unfunny comedy,positive
their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ugly greens dull reds insipid blues full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances,positive
the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness and director aki kaurism ki often matches the colour of characters clothes with the background colour lighting so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment,positive
there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love,positive
their downward downsized downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic as one setback succeeds another bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel,positive
it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs more farce more deadpan wit but the films great strength is the sober empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilonas misfortunes,positive
irony would be an injustice,positive
situations and settings are broad and exaggeratedthis is not realismbut they are not distorted,positive
the emotions are authentic,positive
if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens despite the droll performances the laconic humour thats because kaurism ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered,positive
he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirtyeight who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a twobit restaurant how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wifes former employer demanding the rest of her wages only to have the crap beaten out of him unable to land a single punch when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money,positive
all this is observed keenly with great economy every cut every line of dialogue is judicious,positive
if most films are novelistic in their telling this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear,positive
but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96minute running length,positive
i have seen many movies far less profound less humane less necessary than drifting clouds but they filled me with an urge to watch them again and this one did not,positive
it does not need to be seen twice its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing,positive
it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience because it cannot be pitched to one,positive
there is no selling point,positive
it is all understatement restraint melancholy,positive
the characters are unremarkable their best years behind them their dreams dissipated it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills,positive
this does not make them less fascinating merely less marketable which is a shame because this is a movie which should be seen precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore,positive
it engages us and touches us and resolvessurprisingly and movinglyinto something resembling a happy ending,positive
the only thing greater than the illluck that governs the characters lives is their refusal to give in to despair,positive
their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a feelgood ending elsewhere but not here because this ending differs in kind from most such endings this one has truly been earned,positive
the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you at times cracking up,positive
the film takes place for the most part in realtime during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood,positive
hrundi v bakshi played very well by peter sellers is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland india,positive
hrundi tries out his acting talents but it seems that he just isnt cut out for the job,positive
on the set of his current film that he stars in hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse,positive
during the filming of this movie set in the 1800s hrundi manages to annoy the director herbert ellis in any way he can,positive
this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes wearing an underwater watch in one scene and accidentally detonating a massive set,positive
many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever,positive
and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr clutterbuck j,positive
edward mckinley pleading for hrundis ejection from hollywood everything is pretty much over for hrundi,positive
clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood,positive
but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbucks exclusive party hrundi is invited and certain chaos is bound to occur,positive
of course as predicted hrundi causes lots of trouble,positive
each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation usually one that he cant handle is almost always very humorous,positive
and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter who is alone hilarious adds to the comedy in a great way,positive
the party can be compared to many other films of its type specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations,positive
it also includes a number of memorable scenes can anyone say birdy numnum,positive
if youre in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy check out the party,positive
its not going to be one of your alltime favorites but if you enjoy this type of humor youll enjoy the party,positive
capsule the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multiday festivities,positive
mira nairs film is pleasant enough with a little human drama a few family secrets some sadness and some happiness,positive
you have seen it all before but perhaps not from india,positive
the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable,positive
low 2 4 to 4,positive
mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala,positive
her newest film written by sabrina dhawan is very similar to previous films like betsys wedding but it is set in new delhi,positive
a wealthy family is having a wedding,positive
an indian wedding is a multiday affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial,positive
even more than in the us it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family gettogether,positive
the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members individual story lines,positive
aditi verma is marrying hemant an indian engineer working in the us,positive
she had previously had a relationship with vikram her supervisor,positive
latit her father played by naseeruddin shah is juggling many problems not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey,positive
dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration,positive
even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice one of the family servants,positive
several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex family secrets or both,positive
there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love,positive
some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films,positive
western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna,positive
on the other hand it was not clear to me at least if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films,positive
this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english,positive
the latter will however help with an international release,positive
sabrina dhawans screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog,positive
we have seen films with plotting very much like this but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference,positive
director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life,positive
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film,positive
his american buffalo is a setbound piece that has very little plot,positive
sometimes he will tell a story that really moves,positive
heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work,positive
unlike his the spanish prisoner there are no lapses in credibility,positive
heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games,positive
it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will doublecross whom and frequently it is mamet doublecrossing the viewer,positive
watching the films team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either what the heck are they doing,positive
or why didnt anybody think of that before,positive
appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job,positive
it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay now a regular actor in mamet films,positive
this is a robbery that works like a welloiled machine,positive
there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore played by gene hackman filmed on a security camera,positive
now joe has to get out of the business,positive
it was coming time anyway,positive
joes team including bobby blane delroy lindo fran moor rebecca pidgeon and pinky pincus ricky jay is going to split up and go separate ways,positive
but crime boss bergman danny devito is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery,positive
and he has to take along a young kid the short fused jimmy silk sam rockwell,positive
immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye,positive
much of what distinguishes heist is mamets dialog,positive
remarkably it serves a double purpose,positive
the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamets special feel for dialog,positive
hackman has lines like everybody needs money,positive
thats why they call it money,positive
mamets timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production,positive
the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score which is in fact a very similar story,positive
both are good films perhaps for some of the same reasons,positive
but at least on a high level they are much the same story,positive
the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them,positive
i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 2001,positive
that made the subject matter just a little too timely,positive
my understanding is that the release will be delayed,positive
my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeons acting at times seems very poor,positive
it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection as if they are just reading the words for the first time,positive
it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller,positive
it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all,positive
what does takes place is more based on character development,positive
the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people nick beth carol and sid,positive
what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at,positive
nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield arizona to butte montana,positive
and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different,positive
carol is nicks exgirlfriend and beths best friend sid is a jointsmoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in,positive
obviously based on a stage play the problem with the movie is that theres a lot of things left out,positive
its not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other the reason why nick was fired from his job isnt mentioned,positive
and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery when he hasnt seen them for many years,positive
set in a small fictional,positive
town in arizona was a good move since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings,positive
the name of the city is not important this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future,positive
particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her,positive
not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with but ill keep an eye on her in the future,positive
interesting trivia this was rated r in the us but rated barntill ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it,positive
i feel no hesitation in saying that theres something about mary is the best film that i will see all year,positive
from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998,positive
it is that good of a film,positive
when gene siskel said this about fargo only a few months into 96 i dismissed the notion as ridiculous,positive
how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it,positive
but after seeing the farrellys hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork i now know what siskel was talking about,positive
once in a very great while a film comes along that is so daring so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end you just want to stand up and cheer,positive
and you know at that instant that you have just experienced something very special,positive
now for the shocker mary is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed pink flamingos obviously notwithstanding,positive
the movie is so rude and i guess inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents luckily i had seen it before them so i could warn the about what they were in for,positive
forget blazing saddles animal house and even the former king of grossout comedy monty pythons meaning of life they were all only preludes to the farrellys assault on the senses,positive
in fact this may even be the funniest film ive ever had the pleasure of seeing the only real contender is monty python and the holy grail and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade,positive
but as funny as it is something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of mary it has a huge heart,positive
you see the farrellys are truly gifted filmmakers,positive
they dont just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes although there are plenty to go around,positive
they also very wisely add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses,positive
its funny though,positive
if you just look at an outline of the story it seems kind of contrived and predictable,positive
but believe me it is anything but,positive
ben stiller plays ted a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe mary cameron diaz,positive
after he sticks up for her retarded brother warren w,positive
early brown the cameraman believe it or not from scream his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom,positive
in one of the films funniest scenes something goes wrong i wont ruin it for those who know nothing about the film and ted is unable to face mary ever again,positive
jump to the present,positive
after years of selfloathing ted finally hires private detective pat healy a suitably slimy matt dillon to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school,positive
healy finds that mary is still a fullblown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself,positive
admittingly the basic story line leaves a little to be desired,positive
after all with a notreallyallthatfunny premise how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours,positive
somehow the farrellys pull it off,positive
the performances here are also right on target,positive
as ted stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating as he would normally be but very lovable,positive
and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons but the actor who really grabs your attention is w earl brown as marys brother,positive
no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here,positive
i know he wont be nominated but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february,positive
as good as the actors are though its the directors movie all the way,positive
i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielbergs wwii epic saving private ryan,positive
and yes that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting,positive
but which is harder making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they cant breath for minutes at a time,positive
ill let you decide that one for yourself but this critic is sticking to his guns,positive
there is just something about mary,positive
when you get out of jail you can kill him,positive
starring ashley judd tommy lee jones bruce greenwood,positive
rated r,positive
double jeopardy is a lurid prepostrous thriller thats also one of the years most enjoyable,positive
its an uncompromisingly brutal cheerfully anarchic hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it,positive
there is not a moment here when the events on screen dont have a direct bearing on the plot once the film gets going it never stops,positive
it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and thats probably a correct assessment of the plot but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones,positive
not even bothering with character introduction director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the getgo and never finds the brake,positive
we meet rather hastily libby and nick parsons ashley judd and bruce greenwood respectively a seemingly happy married couple with a son matty age 4 they go out on a sailboat one night and after a period of some rockin sex they go to sleep,positive
libby hears a strange noise wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood,positive
she follows a red trail to the upper deck where she finds a knife and out of astonishment picks it up,positive
at that convenient moment the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested,positive
her lawyer a friend puts up a defense in court but though we know she is innocent the evidence against her is too compelling,positive
her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison,positive
once in prison she makes a phone call to her friend,positive
her friend gives her son the phone,positive
nick walks in the room,positive
little matty screams daddy,positive
the phone goes dead,positive
libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isnt even dead,positive
she gets some advice from a lawyer who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband they cant convict her of the same crime again meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they cant touch her,positive
after a weirdly short amount of time she gets out of parole,positive
she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees under the command of parole officer travis lehman tommy lee jones,positive
she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated,positive
she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her sons adopter,positive
double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false,positive
the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime same time same place same circumstances,positive
its not like it matters,positive
this is a rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast and furious,positive
its silly alright but this is the kind of film you just dont question,positive
in some films plausibility is everything,positive
double jeopardy however is not concerned with making sense its sole purpose is to entertain and it does,positive
judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role,positive
this is her breakout boxoffice performance and she is terrific,positive
she brings some emotion to what could have been a onedimensional role giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces,positive
tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive but the movie makes good use of his stonefaced wit,positive
thankfully too double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the films story,positive
this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that,positive
the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book,positive
after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system its great to see a movie that doesnt so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure,positive
double jeopardy is really good but it isnt the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards,positive
its one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off otherwise your brain will be busy ruining your experience,positive
this is a thriller that isnt concerned with being smart or plausible,positive
instead it diverts all attention to the action which this year is second to none,positive
theres a thin line between satire and controversy and mike nichols the birdcage wolf has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election,positive
based on the book written by anonymous actually former newsweek writer joe klein john travolta plays governor jack stanton,positive
but he doesnt actually play stanton,positive
he plays bill clinton just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville although the credits will of course say otherwise,positive
the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton adrian lester a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton,positive
he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations and whether it be keeping the history of his boss pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers,positive
richard jemmons billy bob thorton and daisy green maura tierney team up with henry as the wouldbe presidents advisors and hire lesbian veteran libby holden kathy bates as the campaigns eccentric tougher than dirt incriminator,positive
together they face all sorts of sexual allegations the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race,positive
in its satire and controversy primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nittygritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue,positive
but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out its characters letting us understand what they want and why and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent,positive
seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look,positive
and the rest of the cast also make superb performances adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden,positive
at occasions you cant help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste,positive
there are long slabs of time where john travolta unquestionably the most interesting to watch is missed from the screen and since it is awkwardly structured as henrys story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot or even the point of the film,positive
having said that make no mistake primary colors is always enjoyable to watch,positive
but frequently we have to ask ourselves exactly what are we watching,positive
most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary and almost unsuitable to the rest of the film,positive
but as i mentioned before there is a thin line between satire and controversy and for the most part primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a farfromoverpowering look at winning the publics opinion,positive
although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is,positive
thankfully it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really its scary,positive
pollock starring ed harris marcia gay harden tom bower jennifer connelly screenplay by barbara turner and susan j emshwiller based on the book jackson pollock an american saga by steven naifeh and gregory white smith directed by ed harris,positive

how do you know when youre finished making love,positive
jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when youve completed a painting,positive
jackson pollocks making love quote is famous but in practically the same breath he said a more constructive thing its like looking at a bed of flowerstear your hair out over what it means,positive
it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept,positive
the biopic pollock actor ed harris directorial debut reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollocks creations as part of the order of things and should similarly disarm haters of fine art,positive
arguably more than any other living actor harris who also plays pollock embodies the archetypal working stiff and his bluecollar demystification of pollocks labourintensive art both as performer and director makes for unpretentious cinema,positive
from what i know of harris he like pollock was not born gifted or lucky instead a strong work ethic is the seed of his success,positive
granted its possible that pollock will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable purpose of pollocks splatter series the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing,positive
the movie pollock is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums but the motivations are left to our own perceptions,positive
and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion,positive
pollock encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons alcoholism depression and the general attendant miseries of an artist while finding a place of subconscious expression,positive
a brief introduction to pollocks raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist lee krasner marcia gay harden awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal who works from the outsidein preintellectualizing every stroke of her brush,positive
in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says you paint the fucking thing and leaves in a huff,positive
by the time they wed she has become his de facto manager it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline a most harmonious collision,positive
krasner denies him a baby indicating that it would upset the balance,positive
such a union is destined to implode and i hope im not ruining the pollock experience by saying that it does,positive
while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to startpollock and wife channel their passions elsewheretheir symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollocks conniptions too many you are killing me,positive
you are killing me,positive
you are killing me,positive
aside harris own wife amy madigan is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim,positive
pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman the scorching jennifer connelly hoping one supposes to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth,positive
i love jackson pollocks stuff and i am enamoured of harris pollock as well,positive
its scrappy and observant no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish such as jeff beals hummable but no less lamentable scorei cant imagine that pollock or anyone would paint to this music which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images,positive
one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet reenactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton long island the mounting tension is almost comic as namuth keeps interrupting pollocks process to reload his camera or take a dinner break,positive
a more seasoned director mightve been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal,positive
the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest little caper adventure entitled where the money is,positive
the elderly bank robber is henry paul newman a famous criminal that was only recently caught,positive
he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune,positive
always the shrewd thinker he begins working on a plan to get out of jail,positive
this involves years of studying buddhism and selfhypnosis,positive
when he is prepared to execute his plan he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke,positive
now a seemingly twitching vegetable he is temporarily transferred to a staterun home,positive
carol linda fiorentino is the nurse that cares for him,positive
shes a very bright person with a good heart,positive
yet her life is a miserable waste of time,positive
the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars,positive
her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics,positive
worse shes in a deadend relationship with highschool sweetheart wayne dylan mcdermott,positive
they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom,positive
to her this made sense long ago,positive
but now its a different story,positive
wayne seems equally bored with his life but is content enough to stay put,positive
waynes greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman,positive
carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients but shes never been anywhere else and doesnt see many other opportunities in life,positive
however when henry falls under her care her outlook begins to change,positive
the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke,positive
carol however begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all,positive
maybe she can get through to him and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away,positive
the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry back to life,positive
and what are some of carols resuscitation techniques,positive
perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses,positive
if that fails maybe shell try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20foot high pier into the cold lake below,positive
when he finally comes out of his state of selftrance the movies direction changes though it remains equally if not more entertaining,positive
carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and selfassuredness,positive
she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy,positive
this of course puts wayne in an odd situation,positive
henry and carols bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car,positive
henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash,positive
meanwhile this is carols ticket to a better life,positive
wayne is uncomfortable with the situation but helps out nonetheless,positive
however his lack of commitment threatens their success,positive
the heist sequence is suspenseful well paced and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong,positive
where the money is does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist,positive
newman is the real joy of the film adroitly showing that at age 75 hes still really hot stuff,positive
he possesses a sly smile displays a dominating attitude and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive,positive
fiorentino is also a fun presence,positive
you root for her despite her sense of amorality,positive
sure she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchairstricken man into a lake but we can see that to escape her deadend world she needs to do something drastic,positive
with two charismatic characters such as these its hard to ignore that where the money is is where the fun is,positive
hes back and its about time,positive
was the motto for this television series pilot i call it a pilot i dont care what fox network says revival of the cult classic british tv show doctor who that spawned no series which means there are no smart network execs out there not exactly news to a lot of people i know,positive
the motto was well chosen,positive
the series was simple it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies including the evil daleks and the master who appears in this feature played very badly by eric roberts,positive
as good as this revival was there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who,positive
is it the acting,positive
hell no,positive
paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys whove played the doctor including his predecessor and offscreen friend sylvester mccoy who appears once more for the regeneration scene,positive
he looks right for the role is a brilliant actor and slips effortlessly into the role the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would,positive
daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr grace holloway the doctors first companion that he kisses on screen she is not your typical female companion who screams and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor she is a tough spunky american and ashbrook shows this well,positive
young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee and ive seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end this film included which imho wastes his talent,positive
the only problem with the acting is eric roberts,positive
one time he had to say to mcganns doctor i always dress for the occasion,positive
but he broke it up and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric i always,positive
dress,positive
for the occasion,positive
you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act and whos also british like mcgann is as the doctor,positive
executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role,positive
i dunno who thought of casting him but if theyre reading this news flash eric roberts is not a star,positive
he rides on his sisters coattails and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him,positive
is this problem the kisses to the past,positive
they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them only whovians would and theyre good,positive
is it the script or the movie as a whole,positive
the script is a classy piece of work featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue and the movie as a whole is one fans will love and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series,positive
so what is it,positive
simple no plot,positive
the master on his last legs sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him,positive
the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey but they accidentally land in san francisco 1999 december 31 where the master with young street hood chang lees help opens the eye of harmony which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor with the help of female surgeon dr grace holloway doesnt close it by then,positive
virtually no plot,positive
i was told the movie wouldve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks but a lot of rewriting went on on the set,positive
that shows how smart people are as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting and that wouldve gotten a four star rating out of me,positive
ive never been a member of the robin williams fan club,positive
a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way and i sometimes feel as though im watching a 40yearold class clown,positive
in his films williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchyfeely emotion leading to wildly uneven performances,positive
mrs,positive
doubtfire seemed readymade for the same problems but instead it proves to be williams best comic screen project yet,positive
while it still contains some characteristic selfindulgence mrs,positive
doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging bellylaugh comedy served up with high energy,positive
williams stars as daniel hillard a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior,positive
one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda sally field and she files for a divorce,positive
unemployed living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children daniel decides to respond to mirandas ad for an afternoon housekeeper,positive
he turns to his brother frank harvey fierstein a theatrical makeup artist and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire a matronly 65yearold englishwoman,positive
daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on mirandas flirtation with a wealthy client pierce brosnan to spend time with the children and to learn something about responsible parenting all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best,positive
mrs doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work and basically it does so,positive
the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel and thanks to the fantastic special makeup thats instantly believable,positive
it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film making dustin hoffmans dorothy michaels look like milton berle,positive
more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell its a bit hard to swallow that she doesnt recognize any of the voices as her husbands,positive
perhaps the biggest contrivance were asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs doubtfire in a few minutes,positive
theres more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask,positive
fortunately these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll,positive
during the film i was generally too busy laughing,positive
after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams riffing mrs,positive
doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place,positive
daniels frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful as is the climactic restaurant sequence even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away,positive
clearly most of the credit for doubtfires success goes to robin williams,positive
it took putting him in drag but for once he plays a comic character that isnt just robin williams with a different name,positive
he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foulmouthed,positive
wisely he never aims for saintly,positive
his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity,positive
its one of mrs,positive
doubtfires charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect just people trying to be better,positive
as miranda sally field is solid in a background role and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu,positive
the children are also good although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest,positive
the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing,positive
its easy to see mrs,positive
doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over and its true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common,positive
but mrs,positive
doubtfire manages to carve out its own space particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judges decision and the ultimate status of daniel and mirandas relationship,positive
theres nothing dazzlingly new in mrs,positive
doubtfire but there are plenty of laughs and good comedies are always in short supply,positive
and its nice to see robin williams just act for a change,positive
after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard out steps a steelgray humanlike creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit,positive
spencer the boy who observes this having seen his fill of science fiction flicks figures this thing must be a robot from outer space,positive
with the exception of disney and a few others most studios view childrens films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit,positive
star kid stands out as that rare kids film that is undoubtedly lowbudget but is also highly imaginative,positive
remember the robot,positive
it wasnt one at all but rather a phase one assault cyborsuit,positive
the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors,positive
the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit and the cyborsuit nicknamed cy has plenty of spunk,positive
cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like cool,positive
upon hearing that command cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop,positive
and when cy speaks we see spencers view the backside of cys lips and eyes,positive
as 12yearold spencer joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tonguetied kid,positive
even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit he has his fears but he learns to overcome them,positive
if you run away things dont get better whether its bullies spiders or girls his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three,positive
turbo joey simmrin the schools chubby bully beats up on him spiders frighten him and most embarrassing of all he cant speak when in the presence of his wouldbe girlfriend,positive
with his cyborsuit on he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy,positive
spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey played by a smartmouthed ashlee levitch who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker,positive
stacey derides her brother whom she barely tolerates by referring to him only as the fungus,positive
this whole setup for spencers downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment,positive
the beauty of mazzellos performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson hell not soon forget,positive
the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing,positive
the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately,positive
when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire michelle lauren eckstrom his eyes open wide in revulsion,positive
mate with her,positive
spencer exclaims,positive
pllllleeeeease i just like her thats all,positive
the show has many funny twists,positive
in one cy sees a man in a barneylike costume and begins firing at him thinking he is an alien lifeform,positive
soon things get way out of hand and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat,positive
as proof positive of the shows class it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor thought that was an oxymoron in a kids picture didnt you,positive
cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious,positive
the directors staging of this sequence is one of the films more charming moments,positive
oh and eating is pretty funny too,positive
spencer whose idol is the comic book character midknight warrior gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit,positive
spencers valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle,positive
and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition,positive
for a family movie mixing humor fantasy and action star kid delivers,positive
although its probably not the sort of movie youd want to see without kids with them youll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story,positive
youll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through,positive
star kid runs 1 41,positive
it is rated pg for fantasy combat,positive
although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up and possibly the younger ones,positive
my son jeffrey age 8 got really excited about the picture,positive
he called it an especially good movie and gave it,positive
when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully,positive
an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80s,positive
sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte who are on the lookout for love,positive
alice is mousy shy intellectual charlotte is bitchy outgoing and fun,positive
we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures and men all to the background of the local disco,positive
whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story,positive
alice and charlotte are both well written characters and the actresses who play them arent bad aswell,positive
sevigny delivers an honest performance and makes the audience feel for her character,positive
beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable,positive
the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining,positive
the dialogue is sharp and well written with many funny set pieces,positive
for example theres a great discussion about lady the tramp by the main characters,positive
the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun,positive
the direction is good bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes,positive
but their are slight flaws with the movie,positive
firstly although it is supposedly set in the 80s the characters are very very 90s,positive
the way they dress and act have a very 90s feel to them,positive
although the male hairstyles look slightly 80s frankly the 80s atmosphere just wasnt conveyed which is a shame,positive
also as mentioned above the film is too long and some parts do lag,positive
the charm of the characters do help these moments but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter,positive
the plot also sidetracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust which seemed out of place in this movie,positive
finally their are almost too many characters in the film and despite the running time the film never really spends enough time on them,positive
some of the characters are very slight which is a shame,positive
the conclusion while funny is also surprisingly weak and certainly not strong enough,positive
but despite these qualms the last days of disco is a funny warm movie which is certainly worth seeing and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80s,positive
worth a look,positive
overall rating,positive
review by david wilcock 1998,positive
you know for kids norville barnes,positive
synopsis its 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york,positive
disco music is popular and the sexual revolution is on but the people of new york are not happy,positive
in fact theyre terrified,positive
as in spike lees do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip and peoples tempers are flaring,positive
the cool of night offers no respite the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam,positive
no one knows who the son of sam is and no one is safe,positive
all around new york people are different,positive
aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals,positive
in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny john leguizamo tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna mira sorvino,positive
vinnys friend ritchie adrien brody hates disco works at a gay strip club and doesnt want any of the neighborhood folks to know,positive
ritchies girl ruby jennifer esposito is trying to escape a reputation as a slut,positive
everyones different but nobody in the film wants to be framed as alien to the community,positive
unfortunately the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor,positive
opinion director spike lees summer of sam is not about a psycho killer,positive
nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him,positive
its about differences and how given the right conditions even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion,positive
one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex,positive
in other movies sex is glamorized,positive
for example james bond gets a sexual reward for winning,positive
or boring madeforvideo suspense movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake,positive
and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess,positive
not so with summer of sam,positive
in a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy,positive
sex is there but it isnt gratuitous or titillating,positive
in fact some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed,positive
sex is in the film because sexual deviance is part of the films major theme of difference breeding hostility,positive
in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 as rare and thoughtprovoking in american cinema as showing a spanking,positive
stuart little is one of the best family films to come out this year,positive
its a cute funny and very goodnatured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords,positive
though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about i do know that this film does not disappoint,positive
finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be with a few surprising twists some very funny moments and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie,positive
stuart little is a mouse,positive
he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption he now lives with the littles,positive
a nice little no pun intended family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city,positive
they have a little boy george played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki and now they have a new son,positive
at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat,positive
george doesnt take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first but once the two play together they instantly bond,positive
stuart however is missing something and he wants to know who his real parents are,positive
the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back,positive
hesitating the littles know whats best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuarts past ending up to a sentimental and very heartwarming ending,positive
one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects,positive
just like in star wars episode 1the phantom menace stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real,positive
from the detail of their fur to the detail of the way the walk the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this 90 million dollar film and it shows,positive
another movie that this has in common with is babe with its talking animals and people understanding them,positive
it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids,positive
michael j fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the homeward bound movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could,positive
he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable,positive
another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball,positive
when he was timon in 1994s the lion king i would have sworn he was a comedian and now in stuart little he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike,positive
for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well,positive
she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr little,positive
both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996s jerry maguire,positive
even though stuart little is completely cgi the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other,positive
stuart little is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter,positive
we get entertainment laughs cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie,positive
its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see,positive
even though it has a 90 million dollar budget im sure it will make over that or just below it respectively,positive
for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know stuart little and toy story 2 are by far the best family films this year,positive
a winner,positive
since 1990 the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style,positive
now instead of emphasizing feelgood stories replete with characters of noble virtues the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow,positive
this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times as 1993s schindlers list shows,positive
most of todays mainstream drama however creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience,positive
thats why pictures like october sky which are a throwback to the good ol dramas of yesteryear are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema,positive
the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam jake gyllenhaal a teenager in the 1950s company town of coalwood west virginia,positive
its a wellknown fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships the rest grow up to work in the coal mine,positive
the mine which is run by homers father chris cooper is not the place for homer however,positive
after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 homer feels a connection with the outside world as he puts it anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did,positive
drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast homer begins to construct rockets,positive
with the help of their history teacher miss riley laura dern and several mine workers the four are soon bound for great things,positive
october sky is a skillfully crafted film and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston,positive
johnston whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing wellknown titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars certainly knows what hes doing here,positive
he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust,positive
he does not push any barriers but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the films charm,positive
his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers or the silent struggle between homers mother and father,positive
the cast is well chosen although the true bright spots are the supporting roles,positive
laura dern jurassic park lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher giving the boys the support and guidance they need,positive
her role is instantly likeable,positive
chris cooper the horse whisperer as homers father is less likeable even downright despicable at times but his turn here gives gravity to the movie,positive
hes definitely a driving force in homers life and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable,positive
the script is generally cheerful projecting the boys endeavors in a lighthearted manner,positive
there are moments when it becomes predictable such as the train tracks scene and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist,positive
it highlights the essence of youth however and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps,positive
october sky should be a success with audiences,positive
although it doesnt have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or shes all that it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards,positive
its a welcome change to the dramatic genre and one that everyone should see,positive
john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has its good side and its bad,positive
its held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending thats pretty satisfying,positive
james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie,positive
the good side some neat scenes of vampires and violence,positive
the bad no scares,positive
yes thats right even though being directed by one of horrors most cherished directors vampires is the least bit scary if not at all,positive
james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the master vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight,positive
daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya a wisecracking guy who really isnt that funny,positive
in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy,positive
of course we all know sunshine kills vampires and that is just how they kill these vampires hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death,positive
after throwing a party for what happened the vampires that did not die come back to trash it,positive
they kill almost all of jacks team leaving only a few alive,positive
sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek but not yet turned into a vampire,positive
she is rescued by jack and flees with them on their search for valek,positive
they have to fight theyre way against vampires leading up to a finale that is welldone with great special effects,positive
vampires definately could have been done better,positive
the makeup special effects and story are first rate but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had,positive
it to me had more humor than horror almost being compared to fright night with the mix of violence and comedy,positive
john carpenter does a great job of directing this film,positive
he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws which are noticeable but forgettable,positive
the script is clever and funny with many lines that make us laugh out loud,positive
i much enjoyed vampires with a few exceptions,positive
its one of those films you see but dont take to heart,positive
you enjoy the time you spent and go on,positive
the recently released psycho is the same way its not as good as youd hope but it is fun and entertaining,positive
vampires is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer,positive
while it was part of former yugoslavia my country croatia used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general,positive
words croatia and croatians were unheard even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations,positive
the rare exception was the dogs of war 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyths bestselling novel yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context,positive
in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people probably terrorists who happen to remove parts of arm dealers stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise,positive
same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business politics and crime,positive
the movie protagonist shannon christopher walken is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe,positive
his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro,positive
shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away,positive
after being arrested and tortured by kimbas secret police shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north colin blakely,positive
upon return he is approached by mining company again but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup detat against kimba,positive
shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war,positive
thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies especially those made in 1980s is its authenticity almost close to documentary,positive
it shouldnt surprise anyone because the author of the novel frederick forsyth made reputation by blending fiction with real life thus creating interesting exciting yet very believable plots for his books,positive
those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers and one of them zinnemmans the day of the jackal is now considered a classic in that genre,positive
this one deals with soldiers of fortune ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires,positive
unlike wild geese that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure script by george malko and gary de vore author whose death last year became real life mystery is serious and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work,positive
the movie doesnt try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda,positive
christopher walken played in many movies yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role,positive
his performance in this film perhaps isnt breathtaking yet adequate,positive
his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned world weary man whose alienation from the normal way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends,positive
although the movie doesnt lack capable actors their roles are miniature compared with walkens and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character,positive
however those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war tom berenger paul freeman jo beth williams victoria tennant in brief cameo and biggest surprise is ed oneill of married with children fame as shannons reluctant colleague,positive
this was the first major production for john irvin and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable yet second class director,positive
with the good script he can make very good movie with the bad script he can make real mess,positive
luckily the dogs of war had a good script,positive
irvins direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel,positive
the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon used on the wrong places,positive
in the final battle scene where we can see mercenaries at work irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes,positive
unfortunately by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didnt help,positive
but despite those shortcomings this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty realistic political drama,positive
1992s alien3 marked not only the death by suicide of its popular protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver but in many ways the alien franchise itselfbox office receipts were anemic thanks to poor audience word of mouth and the critics who rallied around the first two installments 1979s alien and 1986s aliens savaged david finchers slog of a sendoff myself included,positive
hence weaver director jeanpierre jeunet and the others behind alien resurrection faced a twofold challengenot only somehow resurrect ripley but also rescue this onceprofitable series from the scrap heap,positive
despite the odds they have succeeded even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two,positive
writer joss whedon devises a quick easy and painless answer to the dead ripley problemclone her which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 the prison planet of the third film,positive
that done the real challenge presents itselfwhat do with her,positive
alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable exploring her maternal side alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death,positive
what could be next,positive
whedon comes up with a clever spin since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen the blood used for the clone is also infected with alien dna,positive
so the new ripley is indeed newa hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength a psychic bond with the deadly species and a more predatory attitude,positive
unfortunately that is where alien resurrections clever streak in writing stops,positive
the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features,positive
but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought,positive
the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding but once the creatures break free it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers including tough waif call played by a game winona ryder trying to exterminate them,positive
and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy,positive
while the settling into triedandtrue formula is a little disconcerting the formula is triedandtrue for a reason and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon,positive
the alien after all these years is still terrifying and a new breed that is introduced is no less so,positive
the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting most notably an extended underwater sequence,positive
the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji,positive
as technically adept as jeunets direction is perhaps his and for that matter whedons greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series,positive
a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for but the selfawareness of the excess just adds to the fun,positive
no alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scotts alien or the even greater film that james camerons aliens was,positive
but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of finchers alien3 jeunets resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild reckless thrill ride,positive
that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments,positive
in roger michells romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends its name to the films title,positive
one day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase a book on turkey,positive
quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an onagain offagain love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat,positive
the film opens with a nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such,positive
without words this sequence gives us a background to her character,positive
following however is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives,positive
i dont know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldnt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning but there it is,positive
if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it,positive
the film is told nearly first person from williams point of view as he is in every scene,positive
by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily,positive
in fact much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis,positive
a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that hes even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator,positive
or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image,positive
william assures her he wouldnt say a word then adds well ill probably tell myself now and then but id never believe it,positive
great stuff,positive
the downside to spending so much time with william is that we dont get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible,positive
were constantly exposed to williams thoughts feelings actions and desires but dont actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him,positive
there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what shes been thinking all the times in between,positive
this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grants film hands down,positive
he gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance,positive
julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior,positive
anna doesnt get a lot of our compassion,positive
this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast,positive
most notable is rhys ifans as spike williams eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh,positive
hugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst,positive
its a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation,positive
roger michells use of visuals doesnt sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type,positive
for example there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass,positive
whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him,positive
another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air,positive
were generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a birds eye view of the ground below,positive
music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect,positive
its kind of a mixed bag but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video,positive
at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate,positive
notting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it,positive
for a couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and thats not so bad now is it,positive
will hunting matt damon is a natural genius,positive
for a movie character thats usually a death sentence,positive
its a trait associated with what my brother calls too good for this world movies like phenomenon or powder,positive
forgive me for spoiling the ending but will doesnt die,positive
this is no formula movie,positive
in fact its quite fresh and original,positive
its a character study more than anything and thats not surprising considering it was written by two actors damon and costar ben affleck,positive
will works whatever kind of job he can get,positive
first hes a janitor then he works construction,positive
offscreen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him,positive
onscreen he hangs out with his friends picking fights in robust romanticizedhemingway fashion,positive
lambeau stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves a math professor learns that the janitor will is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics,positive
having confirmed hes not a fluke or a savant he does what he can to get will into the education system,positive
he is firmly rejected,positive
finally will lands in jail for one of his fights,positive
lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him,positive
will barely decides to go for the therapy over prison,positive
lambeau treats will like a son,positive
hes proud of and amazed by wills accomplishments in mathematics,positive
he encourages will and tries to give him structure knowing that with a little discipline he could be bigger than einstein,positive
will isnt really interested in academia,positive
he knows he would be the best in his field and therefore spend all of his time in an office explaining math to people like lambeau,positive
he would rather work construction which breaks lambeaus heart,positive
meanwhile will attends his mandated therapy sessions,positive
its not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeaus a list,positive
will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade and how to keep them from affecting him,positive
shrink after shrink refuses to return after wills mockery,positive
lambeaus last hope is his old college roommate now a psychology teacher at a smalltime community college,positive
knowing that will is going to try to shred him too sean robin williams agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein,positive
true to form will finds seans emotional weakness and attacks,positive
but unlike the other shrinks sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions,positive
like a foster mother with a fussy child sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride,positive
like the foster mother sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach,positive
robin williams is excellent in this role,positive
hes not an actor with a great range but in the right roles he has great depth,positive
in this movie as in awakenings there comes a point when the quiet shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes,positive
williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling,positive
i have compared will to a foster child and thats not entirely fair,positive
emotionally he has a lot to learn but he is not a child,positive
he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants,positive
sean his girlfriend his pals and lambeau all help him grow but he didnt start out asking for or particularly needing help,positive
his exceptional gift singled him out and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction,positive
if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama,positive
its too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama,positive
it is emotionally engaging but its not quite larger than life,positive
this isnt a problem per se but at times i didnt know quite how to take it,positive
but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie,positive
a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow,positive
it doesnt just happen it takes a good script good acting and good direction,positive
good will hunting has all three,positive
if you are at all inclined to see it by all means go,positive
few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parkers adaptation of frank mccourts memoir angelas ashes,positive
many dismissed it as an humorless sentimentalized uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel others hailed it as a heartfelt sincere portrait of the human spirit,positive
im somewhere in between leaning strongly towards the latter,positive
its certainly wellmade and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be,positive
but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudolyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the twoandahalf hour running time that screams im important,positive
mccourts book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900s a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us,positive
as he comments we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty,positive
in ireland frank played by joe breen as a small child his 3 brothers his mother angela emily watson and his father malachy robert carlyle get financial help from angelas mother a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman,positive
she helps them get a ratinfested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job,positive
positions are scarce and when he does finally find one he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking,positive
meanwhile frank goes to an uptight catholic school where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires,positive
two of franks brothers soon die crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition,positive
as if the poverty and the suffering werent intense enough as it stood malachy and angela have another baby worsening the situation further,positive
i imagine this doesnt sound like much of a plot,positive
thats probably because it isnt one,positive
these are people,positive
this is their story,positive
director alan parker the commitments knows how to tell a good story and angelas ashes despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting,positive
though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue,positive
supplementing parkers able direction are the engaging often poignant performances of the leads some of them seasoned thespians others relative beginners,positive
carlyle the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character,positive
we empathize with the guy but we dont like or admire him,positive
emily watson turns in a heartfelt sincere supporting performance,positive
it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats,positive
also worthy of mention is little joe breen whose face graces the films superb poster,positive
it is breens first feature film and hes extraordinary as young frank,positive
not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense you can peer into the characters soul through breens sad eyes,positive
on the flip side one thing that could have vastly improved angelas ashes is a more decisive editor,positive
while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage,positive
the first half especially could have been trimmed down bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process,positive
things pick up at about the halfway point sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary,positive
spoiler warning,positive
skip next paragraph if in suspense,positive
the films final message is somewhat conflicted as frankie in effect leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america,positive
what exactly are we supposed to make of that,positive
his mother doesnt seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son as any mother would but it still seems inconsiderate of him,positive
i havent read the book but im sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein therefore im suspicious,positive
another thing thats never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title which im sure is also explained in the memoir,positive
if seen as a film onto itself rather than an adaptation angelas ashes stands tall,positive
despite a few minor setbacks it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder,positive
contact shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses,positive
see contact with your family,positive
it is a movie for all ages,positive
a review by stuart cracraft,positive
contact starring jodie foster matthew mcconaughey john hurt director robert zemeckis star,positive
after a predictable mit phillip morrison powersof10 zoomout start which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof morrisons work contact picks up steam gradually building bytheend an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall outofbalance in terms of too much pandering to the technological geek side,positive
by the end the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about whats out there,positive
this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst hightech movies,positive
however except for jodie foster elie arroway and john hurt s r,positive
hadden who are both actors of exceptional caliber the supporting cast are not especially impressive,positive
hurt certainly has had better roles stephen ward in scandal,positive
this one as the multibillionare hadden does not do his acting skills justice,positive
this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation,positive
fosters radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms,positive
early scenes take a long long time to build up to this,positive
the movies pacing is very good and subtle,positive
the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful,positive
the politics of fosters character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however,positive
one of the most entertaining but very short scenes is when foster is confronted by rob lowe during a cabinetlevel presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation,positive
there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored,positive
it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters,positive
everything else was very onesided e g,positive
foster,positive
lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table,positive
the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a faraway world in the starsystem of vega,positive
it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varleys scenes in his book steel beach where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself and in fosters case an illusion drawn from her memory,positive
in another sense this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberrys star trek pilot the cage later the menagerie when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens,positive
the concept is not new by any sense in the world of science fiction,positive
but the beach scene which is the centerpiece of the film as is the whole film is driven by foster,positive
freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast,positive
as the movie gains speed fosters acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her,positive
it is certainly oscarcaliber acting unquestionably,positive
the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos cleverly manipulated george stephanopolusstyle to seem very forrest gump,positive
in fact zemeckis et,positive
al,positive
got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie vis a vis clinton,positive
but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clintons walkons,positive
the muchdiscussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not,positive
also the nearfinal scene in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing,positive
contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan science popularizer and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe,positive
perhaps now sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden,positive
dark city is such a rare treat it s a stunning hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london,positive
to boot it is accompanied by an intense well written and thoughtful story,positive
movies of this caliber and idea aren t made too often and it s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it,positive
alex proyas who s previous film the crow looked good but couldn t cover up the terrible acting or story here shows a near masterpiece a combination of metropolis edward hopper and phillip marlowe fused seemlessly,positive
at times it moves beyond film into artwork,positive
it is the story of strangers aliens from another planet and we know they re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats one of the detractions of the film who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live what makes up our soul,positive
these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ultimate technology of shaping matter with their mind called tuning,positive
they are aided by a human scientist played by kiefer sutherland who has betrayed his kind and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight,positive
during this time john murdoch played swiftly by rufus sewell wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light a terrific visual effect not only is murdoch confused but so is the audience,positive
without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer he receives a phone call to flee as the strangers are after him,positive
i don t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop in a way regaining murdoch s identity along with him,positive
it s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography,positive
murdoch s wife anna is introduced through a stunning beam of light she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight,positive
shadows outlines of men in hats watch as she gently curves through the shine,positive
we see the outline of her body from behind an hourglass as she sings a slow rhythmic song,positive
a great entrance,positive
however a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied,positive
the city is nice to look at but if it s a poor story then it s not worth watching,positive
blade runner was popular not only because it s visuals but it s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience,positive
it is discussed it and argued therefore a success,positive
other science fiction films of recent times such as the fifth element are nice to look at but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy,positive
we re left with love conquers all after finishing the fifth element,positive
dark city is not so easily explained away,positive
as the strangers discovered locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task,positive
where is reality,positive
dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 s and ranks along with the best made in the 80s such as blade runner and the two aliens films,positive
perhaps it s the best of the both decades it had the darkness of the aliens films as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner but moved beyond i think because the themes behind it were much stronger,positive
anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write i d love to hear it,positive
the fugitive is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made,positive
it takes realistic believable characters and tells an exciting story thats totally believable throughout,positive
this isnt an overthetop action flick for the sake of action this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly,positive
harrison ford stars as dr richard kimble a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife,positive
the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder but is not told in a straightforward manner,positive
we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimbles perspective,positive
hints are dropped from various times of the night kimbles wife helen sela ward was murdered,positive
we dont get to see who the killer is until much further into the story,positive
in fact we might even have a little doubt about kimbles innocence ourselves,positive
the film doesnt spend much time on the details of kimbles trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story,positive
one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck,positive
but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated it is actually suspenseful to watch,positive
this movie is so incredible because its able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable,positive
tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard a u s marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives,positive
from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur,positive
kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other,positive
most of the film deals with richards complex investigation as he tries to find the onearmed man who killed his wife,positive
ford does not have a lot of lines here so it is stuart and twohys script and daviss outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is,positive
just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits disguising himself and doing his own detective work is very interesting,positive
we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed so as he learns more so do we,positive
meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down,positive
at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues but richard is just too smart for them,positive
he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery,positive
one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor,positive
there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo pantoliano and biggs roebuck,positive
they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer yet they constantly start up small talk with each other making funny wisecracks and oneliners but not in any kind of distracting manner,positive
the final act concludes with another terrific chase,positive
richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him and although we get a typical fight scene the case is far from solved,positive
the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along and we dont realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together,positive
maybe the finally scene is a bit much but it still has a believable atmosphere to it,positive
were so relieved when justice is served,positive
its not the plot is that makes the fugitive great its all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story,positive
watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous,positive
if only hollywood could produce more movies like this,positive

susan grangers review of hearts in atlantis castle bros,positive
timing is everything and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the comingofage nostalgia of stand by me with the mystical power of the green mile,positive
based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks its set in 1960 in harwich connecticut where fatherless 11 yearold bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in a boarding house with his resentful selfcentered mother hope davis,positive
hes devoted to his neighborhood friends mika boorem will rothhaar but his pivotal relationship is with a strange new tenant ted brautigan anthony hopkins who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him instead a library card,positive
knowing hes longing for a schwinn bike ted offers to pay him 1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers,positive
the story structure consists of one long flashback framed by the present featuring the adult bobby david morse minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins mysterious character is genteel sensitive and benignly seductive,positive
the only explanation is that hes a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate given the inexplicable state of the world right now,positive
the production values and performances are solid particularly hopkins arguably the finest most versatile actor of our era and the children with whom he forges a firm bond,positive
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 hearts in atlantis is a wistful enigmatic 8 evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis,positive
a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates a film which was based on the bestseller by george v higgins,positive
it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51yearold smalltime hood eddie fingers coyle mitchum,positive
he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment,positive
his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 35 year stretch in new hampshire something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesnt think he could survive prison at his age,positive
he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare,positive
he could have cut a deal and gotten off if he turned his boss over to the d a but he figured he would never live if he did that,positive
he is currently gunrunning for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise rocco,positive
the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank managers house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it,positive
on one of the heists they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm,positive
coyles best friend is dillon boyle a hit man for the mob working as a bartender,positive
he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents as an aggressive young agent named foley jordan who likes to be called uncle gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his lowlevel crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs,positive
with the sentencing date closing in on him the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time,positive
he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain,positive
thinking he made an ironclad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down knowing fullwell the young hustler keats selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence,positive
but foley tells him after he arrests the gundealer that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence they want him to be a fulltime informer,positive
warning spoiler follows in next paragraph,positive
the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend,positive
the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up,positive
coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says to be young like that and have his future hes the greatest hockey player in the world,positive
dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mobstyle having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston,positive
this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets of the hopeless situation the lowlevel criminals are in and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next,positive
the city streets are ugly the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests whether it is betrayal or murder,positive
there is a fatalistic feel about their lives something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat,positive
mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs as it overcomes a thin plot,positive
it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them,positive
mitchum is a loser and that he lived so long is a tribute to his skills as a survivor,positive
but in the end he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle,positive
seen december 28 1997 at 8 45 p m at the crossgates mall cinema 18 guilderland ny theater 8 with matt perreault and my sister jena for free matt paid using prepaid passes,positive
if theres ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non stop action the james bond films are it,positive
and if theres ever been a james bond film that not only proves this but does so by pushing it to the extreme tomorrow never dies is it,positive
opening sequences almost always make or break action films,positive
when done properly not only are they actually exciting but they foreshadow things to come,positive
this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie but with a sense of the selfaware enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in,positive
first theres a hightech slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly chinese waters,positive
theres definite tension as there seems to be an unknown but certainly hostile third party involved who is manipulating both sides,positive
when the scene ends in tragedy its clear theres some kind of powerful conspiracy going on and who else to call on for such a case but james bond,positive
the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond brosnon,positive
as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious bond is clearly and obviously depicted as an outandout hero,positive
he singlehandedly takes out a small army of terrorists and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the copilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down,positive
this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for over using but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly,positive
its not about the payoff because its obvious bond will escape instead its the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it all the while creating for witty hysterical comedy,positive
it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore because of political correctness and just plain coppingout on behalf of the filmmakers even the term villain sounds passe,positive
what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come yet making him seem completely plausible,positive
jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant cunning elliot carver a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world that is through his massive media empire not through nuclear weapons,positive
through some interesting detective work bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news,positive
not only is that an original idea for a conflict but one which could carry over into reality,positive
surprisingly this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become,positive
the films hook is the action and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way,positive
the story works much like bond himself always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot,positive
somehow a chinese agent wai lin yeoh bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together,positive
the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid but also works because of this not in spite of it,positive
the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story,positive
although tomorrow never dies is far from perfect it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue,positive
in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because in a year plagued by brothers mcmullenstyle earnestly shallow genx angst pictures it seemed to be actually about something,positive
it angered people started arguments outside the theater riled things up,positive
it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film,positive
having endured my share of the hype i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about,positive
does men live up to its press,positive
well yes it does,positive
and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office,positive
for the uninitiated newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment,positive
chad and howard are archetypes examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business,positive
chad is the blond golden boy genetically engineered for success the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder,positive
howard is chads boss but he is weaker of will the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent,positive
we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge,positive
there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office woo her simultaneously win her love and then dump her,positive
the reason,positive
both men have recently been dumped themselves and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex,positive
itll restore a little dignity to our lives he says,positive
howard helpless against the force of chads will agrees to the plan,positive
they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine stacy edwards a fragile deaf woman working as a temp,positive
chad moves in for the kill flashing his golden boy smile plying christine with lunch then flowers then dinner,positive
howard follows suit though his efforts are in contrast hamhanded and desperate,positive
flattered to have the attention of two eligible men christine dates them both,positive
you can guess which one she falls for,positive
soon a tragic lovers triangle develops christine loves chad chad loves himself and howard loves christine on the grounds that since shes handicapped and shy she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him,positive
adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high does it,positive
in chad labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to filmhannibal lector may eat human flesh but chad is an eater of souls,positive
his evil is as subtle as a vipers and as easy as his smile,positive
we watch in stunned disbelief as he backstabs coworkers humiliates his subordinates and works his deadly venom into christines heart,positive
his character would be a joke if he wasnt so chillingly real all of us have worked with a chad and some of us may be him,positive
hes the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness,positive
if one of his coworkers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns he had best have his escape route clearly in mind,positive
politics is his game and the modern cubiclefilled office is his playground,positive
men wears the guise of a black comedy but it functions best as allegory,positive
the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company then forces him to prove it in a manner i wont describe,positive
the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril,positive
could it happen in the real world,positive
probably not,positive
taken as allegory however it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society,positive
maybe its just the english major in me but chad in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism of greed without conscience,positive
the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism only the strong will survive,positive
the marvel of labutes multilayered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way,positive
but does the film work as entertainment,positive
its darned funny in spots particularly in the mens room scenes which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions,positive
it works less well as drama since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers,positive
stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine and succeeds in making us care for her but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her,positive
likewise chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions,positive
by the end of the film youll feel as if youve met a genuine monster in chad perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film,positive
certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed,positive
but the picture is often mesmerizing and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship which makes it well worth your time,positive
like all good films it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world,positive
while watching chad in his moment of triumph i couldnt help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs,positive
there may be a little bit of chad in all of us but some of us have taken chadness to the level of art,positive
summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a house and carry on a tradition of a large sunday dinner,positive
for a year now they have been inviting a guest for dinner and discussion,positive
on this occasion one of the roommates pete ron eldard brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car broke down,positive
the stranger is zack bill paxton who appears like a decent enough good samaritan,positive
nothing could be further from the truth,positive
after some dinner conversation it appears that zack is among other things a racist you know my grandfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were going to be so much trouble wed have picked the damn cotton ourselves and an antisemite,positive
an argument escalates at the dinner table and leads to violence,positive
after zack assaults marc jonathan penner and pete zack is killed,positive
the roommates are at odds with what to do,positive
marc pete and paulie annabeth gish immediately wish to call the police,positive
luke courtney b vance and jude cameron diaz suggest something different,positive
after more discussion they agree to dispose of the body and cover it up,positive
they do not want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide,positive
when it is done the roommates realize that it was easier than they thought,positive
so easy in fact that they decide that every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views,positive
if they all agree that the guest deserves to die they will poison them and bury them in the back yard,positive
the back yard fills up rather quickly its victims including among others a right to life extremist an antienvironmentalist and a homophobe,positive
by the time the roommates get to their tenth victim they begin to question their methods,positive
are they giving the guests a chance,positive
are they even giving them good food anymore,positive
this film is what i like to call a hidden treasure,positive
this film is such a pleasant surprise,positive
a well written devilish satire that is funny sexy and original,positive
this film should be a hit but i guess the fact that it apparently had no marketing wouldnt give it much of a chance,positive
i had never heard of it until i saw a copy at my video store,positive
stacy title does a wonderful job directing,positive
she somehow finds the time to give all of the characters enough screen time to develop a distinct personality,positive
from the five members of the house to other key characters including sheriff stanley nora dunn the local law closing in on the truth and the dream dinner guest norman arbuthnot ron perlman a rush limbaugh clone who should be the roommates easiest kill,positive
perlman gives the films best performance,positive
he finds the right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends and gains followers and may just inadvertently talk his way out of death,positive
the other actors are convincing as well as all of the roommates deal with their murderous ways,positive
some of the characters appear to be heading down the road towards insanity while others grieve their decisions,positive
when friends ask me to recommend a movie this is usually the first one i think of,positive
i am not saying that this is my favorite movie although it is in my top ten but because the film was such a wonderful surprise i have a fondness for it,positive
i also try to recommend films like this ones that have not been seen by many people but should,positive
if youve ever perused my college comedy diary another year in the life of a nerd i never run out of cheap plugs you know i didnt get along with my firstsemester roommate too well,positive
in fact during the threeweek period between thanksgiving and christmas break i said a total of four sentences to him,positive
so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room,positive
then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk,positive
scratch that idea,positive
but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal,positive
of course in my case it would be a silent picture,positive
even without the college element i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do unless you count studying for final exams and who does,positive
im glad i did,positive
peter falks performance was actually what made the movie,positive
and this is a guy i never considered a real actor more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries,positive
falk pleasantly surprised me here permanently earning my respect so all you columbo fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off,positive
falk plays rocky a 107yearold polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kids parents die,positive
the movie begins with the moms death and the son moving in with his grandparents,positive
after a couple stops along the sons journey to manhood roommates progresses to the present day with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave,positive
the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution rocky will have to move into his place the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students communists,positive
the movie spans nine more years of rockys relationship with his grandson and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love withgaspa woman and starts spending all his time with her,positive
so in his grandsons absence rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed,positive
or am i confusing movie plots again,positive
roommates has an almost epic feel to it covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die,positive
death though knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie,positive
roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween,positive
the number cant be counted on one hand unless of course youre the victim of some hideous genetic mutation,positive
and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie no not duran duran,positive
i wont come out and say it,positive
instead ill just sit here and hum eye of the tiger until each and every one of you figures it out,positive
roommates plays on all the major emotions,positive
it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry,positive
movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience even though this one bombed at the theaters,positive
my point,positive
there are no absolutes,positive
or another possible point peter falk just isnt such a great box office draw,positive
either way this is still a good movie and you should give it a chance like i did whether you hate your roommate or not,positive
most sequels dont do what theyre supposed to do like toy story 2 does,positive
far too many of them end up rehashing the original and adding very little,positive
is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors,positive
thankfully toy story 2 is a wonderful exception,positive
i cant remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one,positive
its yet another sign that pixar the acclaimed animation studio behind toy story and a bugs life is still at the top of its game,positive
woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit toy story and things have changed a bit since the last one ended,positive
woody voiced by tom hanks is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp,positive
in his absence he has assigned buzz lightyear tim allen now comfortable in his role as a toy to take charge,positive
unfortunately woodys trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale and is stolen by an overzealous toy collector wayne knight,positive
off to save him are buzz and members of the old toy gang including mr potato head don rickles rex the nervous dinosaur wallace shawn hamm the piggy bank john ratzenberger and slinky dog jim varney,positive
while in captivity woody makes a startling discovery he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950s childrens show entitled woodys roundup,positive
he meets the shows other characters which include jesse joan cusack his cowgirl sidekick the wise old prospector kelsey grammer and bullseye his trusty horse,positive
they have all been anxiously awaiting woodys arrival as once their set is completed they will be sold to a japanese toy museum and finally escape storage forever,positive
this means woody now faces a difficult choice,positive
with his friends coming to rescue him does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever,positive
as in the original film toy story 2 contains firstrate animation and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there,positive
reportedly the film was originally slated for a directtovideo release but after seeing the improvements that had been made disney rightly decided to release it into theaters,positive
the film is well worth seeing on the big screen,positive
the colors are bright the textures sharp and even the human characters look more human,positive
the animation is consistently seamless with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable,positive
there are so many impressive sequences that id find it impossible to list them here but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al s toy barn the store owned by woodys captor,positive
pixars rendition of the family dog is also nicely done with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it,positive
the voice work is also perfectly complementary and as with the first movie does much to help further character development,positive
tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz making you forget who is doing the voice,positive
it was woody and buzz up there not tom and tim,positive
all the cast members from the original reprise their roles and each is excellent,positive
several new voices have been added with joan cusack kelsey grammer and wayne knight doing fine work,positive
toy story 2 is strong in characterization and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie,positive
woody faces difficult choices while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasnt yet realized his status as a toy forcing him to see what he used to be like,positive
the new characters are also developed quite well especially jesse who narrates a sarah mclachlanaided flashback illustrating how she was loved then forgotten by her owner,positive
it may be computeranimated and it may have sappy music but its downright touching,positive
the script despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers is endlessly clever and inventive especially considering that its a sequel,positive
the reason toy story 2 works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the originals success by redoing the same story and using the same characters,positive
not this one,positive
we get character change new characters and new issues brought up,positive
toy story 2 is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself,positive
there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here,positive
the humor is sharp and witty with something to amuse both kids and adults,positive
there are funny asides to films such as star wars and jurassic park among others new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock em sock em robots and appearances from other pixar efforts a bugs life and the 1997 short geri s game,positive
geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woodys broken arm,positive
the action is fast and furious and the chases in the street in a toy store in an elevator on a baggage carousel and in an airplane keep getting bigger and better,positive
toy story 2 never grows stagnant because there is always something new to hold your interest,positive
the more you pay attention to it the more rewarding it is,positive
its rare to see a film like toy story 2 come along because its the kind of film thats almost impossible to dislike,positive
its created purely to entertain and though i enjoy a thoughtprovoking drama as much as the next person its nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do send us out with a smile,positive
its a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing toy story 2 its the rare sequel that manages to expand on and live up to the original,positive
the calendar year has not even reached its midway point but that hasnt prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscarbait season,positive
bille augusts highprofile adaptation of victor hugos classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epichandsome production values strong performances by a topnotch cast a literate screenplaywith one critically missing element emotional sweep,positive
for those not familiar with hugos original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19thcentury frenchset version of the fugitive,positive
after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread the brutish jean valjean liam neeson is paroled,positive
immediately upon release he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night he is caught by authorities only to be forgiven by the bishop who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow,positive
that he does and in doing so breaks his parole which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert geoffrey rush who was one of the guards in valjeans prison camp on his trail,positive
thematically however les miserables is a story about redemption which valjean finds through his dealings with two women the hardluck factoryworkerturnedprostitute fantine uma thurman and her illegitimate daughter cosette,positive
years after breaking parole valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert,positive
valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette mimi newman from her cruel caretakers the thenardiers and raise the child as his own,positive
the father and daughter eventually land in paris where the teenage cosette claire danes falls for dashing student revolutionary marius hans matheson,positive
the decadesspanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of and the danish august turns in his most accomplished englishlanguage work following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last years stylish but highly preposterous mystery smillas sense of snow,positive
he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace,positive
production designer anna asp costume designer gabriella pescucci and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast,positive
neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable rushs finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated oscarwinning theatrics in shine and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role,positive
the younger members of the cast fare less well,positive
danes is convincing as cosette but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction and matheson while competent is a less interesting robert sean leonard,positive
as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is by the time les miserables was over my emotions had only been superficially involved,positive
while i was touched by valjeans relationships with fantine and cosette i was not moved,positive
not even reaching the touching level is the cosettemarius pairing,positive
my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical as i am sure many others is and i was dismayed to see eponine a friend of mariuss who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation the daughter of the thenardiers here she is only briefly seen as a child,positive
her presence would have added some muchneeded conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine fantine was enough,positive
even so as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season les miserables is a thoughtful wellmade entertaining film one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn nobrainers invade the multiplex,positive
the most common and in many cases the only complaint against francis ford coppolas 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder ages,positive
martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more downtoearth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime,positive
unfortunately for scorsese his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppolas influence on mafia portrayals in the movies,positive
seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime,positive
this film was goodfellas epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s,positive
goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story told in bestseller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi who would cowrite the screenplay for the film,positive
the book as well as the film chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill played by ray liotta irishitalian criminal from new york,positive
at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played by paul sorvino local mob boss and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands,positive
after couple of years together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito played by joe pesci he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway played by robert de niro,positive
three of them spend years as best friends and associates gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history,positive
wealth influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen played by lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities domestic abuse arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business,positive
but the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begins to fall apart tommys unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence jimmys reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and finally henrys own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends,positive
goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory,positive
scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker,positive
world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating,positive
scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny,positive
after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history based on some notorious real life events the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths trading the superficial and shortlasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens,positive
scorsese also manages to break viewers moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material scenes that depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience,positive
with the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shots characters dialogue or narrators commentary goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era,positive
even if we dont pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker,positive
first we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used as movies ironic prologue,positive
then instead of single narrator scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards,positive
this multiple points of views both in terms of narration and various subjective shots only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation,positive
same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack,positive
nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easylistening 1950s pop songs while depression paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s,positive
but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed,positive
however thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people,positive
such scenes although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings became very popular among other directors in 1990s,positive
fragmentary character of the screenplay which doesnt have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese,positive
he uses this structure of film to experiment and most successful of such experiments is hilarious a day in life segment near the end of the film,positive
another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents,positive
the most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen to be most quiet and businesslike member of criminal trio gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues,positive
joe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his lines including adlibs probably represent the most memorable element of the film,positive
ray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesnt look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film,positive
liottas henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of lowlevel street thugs,positive
liotta on the other hand improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction,positive
lorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable as karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband,positive
paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering smalltime gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave,positive
as a combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time,positive
because of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s,positive
capsule this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film set in the present,positive
robert deniro stars as a riskadverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend played by marlon brando,positive
edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime,positive
the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense,positive
2 4 to 4,positive
i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before,positive
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens,positive
there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment,positive
there is no rock score,positive
there are no ballet like martial arts,positive
this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and unflashy script,positive
nick played by robert deniro is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks,positive
if a job is not a safe bet pun intended he backs out,positive
sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe,positive
when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game,positive
he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club and decides to manage it full time,positive
he proposes to his girl friend diane angela bassett,positive
she has one condition,positive
he must stay retired from crime,positive
but before the deal can be cemented max a montreal kingpin and personal friend has one last supposedly easy job for nick,positive
nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal,positive
more and more details seem to complicate the job,positive
nicks partner in the crime is to be a smart but uncontrollable young crook jack edward norton,positive
jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat even at his associates homes,positive
the young crook is a knowitall who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way,positive
together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house,positive
the script by kario salem lem dobbs and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old mission impossible television series,positive
we see pieces of the heist being put together last minute changes and things that go wrong much like a good episode of mission impossible,positive
this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise mission impossible films,positive
the complications are however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable,positive
the telling is cold and noirish which is just what it is supposed to be,positive
director frank oz the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film,positive
the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scenestealing acting,positive
edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is lowkey by todays standards,positive
he plays what is nearly a double role,positive
jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house,positive
one nice,positive
character i have not mentioned is stephen jamie harrold,positive
stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mothers basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions,positive
he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon,positive
the film itself remains lowkey up until the time of the climactic heist,positive
then the pace really picks up,positive
before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes,positive
though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown,positive
on the subject of music the score of the score is by howard shore,positive
it adds tension to the suspense scenes but never seems to have much of a melody,positive
angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break,positive
she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does,positive
speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s,positive
it does the job,positive
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale,positive
i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video,positive
it really scared me and i didnt want to go see it,positive
however after i heard about how wonderful it was i wanted to see it,positive
i didnt get a chance to do so until now,positive
the film disneys 25th animated feature opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale a long time ago in the land of prydain there was a king so evil that his spirit was captured in the cauldron,positive
it has been hidden for centuries and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors and with them rule the world and destroy it,positive
then we meet a farmerwizard dallben and his young apprentice taran,positive
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a pigkeeper they have a pig named henwen,positive
one day as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath the pig goes crazy and dallben then realizes after watching hen wens thoughts through a bucket of water that taran must hide hen wen in the forest,positive
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron and only hen wen has the power to show its location,positive
taran leads hen wen into the forest but of course he loses her and tries to go find her,positive
along the way he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi who desires munchings and crunchings much to his dismay besides he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen,positive
when he hears hen wens squeal from far away though he races to her rescue only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants,positive
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned kings castle from far away,positive
taran climbs the castle walls and brings himself into the castle where he attempts to rescue hen wen,positive
he manages to do so but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon,positive
there he meets princess eilonwy and her magic bauble another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron and the two escape through the deep castle walls,positive
along the way taran finds a sword in a burial chamber and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie,positive
the three manage to escape the horned kings castle but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic,positive
as they rest in the forest gurgi reappears claiming to have found hen wens trail,positive
he leads taran eilonwy and fflewdurr by way of pig tracks to a whirlpool,positive
suddenly they all get sucked under and they meet the fairylike fairfolk,positive
taran is reunited with hen wen and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva,positive
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world,positive
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage,positive
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage three comically strange witches inhabit the place,positive
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron they agree to let him have it in exchange for his sword,positive
taran agrees much to eilonwys horror but at least they get the black cauldron,positive
but the cauldron cant be destroyed only its evil powers can be stopped,positive
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will never to return alive,positive
things take a turn for the worse when the horned kings henchmen capture taran eilonwy and fflewdurr along with the black cauldron and lead them back to the castle,positive
taran eilonwy and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors this is the most horrifying scene in the film because here a dead army comes alive,positive
just when all seems lost though gurgi reappears and rescues taran eilonwy and fflewdurr,positive
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron but gurgi stops him not wanting him to throw his life away,positive
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron and the deathless warriors decay,positive
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi but he is forced to do battle against the horned king,positive
he kicks the horned king away who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron where its powers immediately destroy him completely,positive
taran eilonwy and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned kings castle just as it selfdestructs,positive
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away but fflewdurr stops them saying that they never give anything away they bargain,positive
in response to this the witches offer taran his sword back but taran instead has a new trade the cauldron for gurgi,positive
the trade is made gurgis seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group,positive
as taran cradles him in his arms though gurgi stirshe is not dead after all,positive
the happy group then returns home where hen wen brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past dallben and even doli await their triumphant return,positive
as spectacular as it sounds the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times,positive
before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron a sword and sorcery tale for the studio,positive
bringing this book to the screen was the studios fondest dream,positive
miller who entitled himself as the executive producer promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects,positive
when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron,positive
by this time things had gone really rocky for the animation department,positive
many of the studios old men had retired or died,positive
therefore the animators suffered a hard time making this film,positive
originally budgeted at 25 million the costs raised to 40 million because of constant changes on everything and when it was finally released on june 24 1985 the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics but somehow the film flopped,positive
the film was rated pg and the film although disneyfied from lloyd alexanders chronicles of prydain which is what this film is based on was much more scarier and darker than disneys other previous efforts such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it,positive
in addition other critics rejected it for having no heart and unmemorable compared to other disney animated features,positive
but whatever the real reason the black cauldron was a financial disaster grossing only 21 million,positive
the failure of the film grounded the studios animation department and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studios reputation,positive
the next two disney animated features the great mouse detective and oliver and company although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron didnt do much better although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective,positive
only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features,positive
as for the black cauldron it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron,positive
finally the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released,positive
because of all this you might ask yourself was the black cauldron really such a bad movie,positive
the people who had seen the film didnt think so,positive
in fact many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film but of course they denied it,positive
for a while it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video until september 1997 disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom,positive
few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc including me and for those who hadnt seen the film yet i am included here they got quite a treat,positive
but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating in the uk the u rating means universal suitable for all ages kinda like their own version of g,positive
somewhere online a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said bring back the black cauldron and because of that disney finally decided to release the video to the united states,positive
before that time rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed like the uk video so that it would get a g rating and that they would add in songs,positive
those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron would be released in its pg rated version,positive
even still when it was finally released to the us some reaction was mixed,positive
some felt that it was indeed cut but some felt that it wasnt,positive
but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available,positive
as for myself when i saw the movie for the first time on converted ntsc video i didnt expect much at all,positive
in fact i had heard so many mediocre things about it that i didnt think the film would ever be such a good film,positive
much to my surprise when i saw the first few minutes of the film i was asking myself this is the same film everyone saw,positive
the one that flopped at the box office,positive
the one that critics and filmgoers alike called a bad movie,positive
this doesnt seem like all of the above,positive
instead its a classic in its own right,positive
the film has a wonderful cast of characters,positive
theres taran grant bardsley an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pigkeeper the storys hero,positive
the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all but the opposite is true,positive
he is brave loyal and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on,positive
theres a likeable character here,positive
not that hes the only likeable character in the film,positive
theres gurgi john biner a lovable little uh thing who remains loyal to taran even though they dont quite hit it off at first,positive
but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman a dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo who is loyal to the films imaginative and sinister villain the horned king voiced gruesomely by john hurt yet he also fears his neck,positive
the other characters including the sidekicks a spunky but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret although pleasant and likeable arent quite as well rounded as they should be,positive
the story itself is an adventurous one a quest involving the mystical pig hen wen the black cauldron itself and an army of deathless ones with everything a hooking opening to a spectacular finale,positive
elmer bernsteins music also tells the story perfectly in a dark yet calming manner,positive
the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios,positive
even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth the animation overall is top notch,positive
overall this film is an entertaining endeavor,positive
fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one except young kids,positive
there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disneys other films although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary which is the main reason why this film is rated pg,positive
fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie,positive
even though it doesnt have all of the ingredients of a true disney film this film is a classic in its own right and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given,positive
that better chance has finally come,positive
whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared and the film has finally achieved its place among disneys most proudest achievements,positive
i cant help but think though whatever would have happened if the black cauldron was a box office success,positive
dangerous beauty is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583,positive
it is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and certainly nothing short of entertaining but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness,positive
dealing with themes of forbidden love religious intolerance subordination of women sexual freedom and the roles of pleasure and sin in a highcultured society it still feels like brightly lit fluff,positive
the director marshall herskovitz doesnt want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down so he opts for a more genial livelier and relatively shallow interpretation,positive
the film takes place during the renaissance a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe,positive
at this time venice was its own republic and it thrived on being the central juncture of eastwest commerce,positive
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived,positive
however there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment,positive
the story centers on veronica franco catherine mccormack a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier rufus sewell the son of wealthy aristocratic parents jeroen krabb and joanna cassidy,positive
unfortunately the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love rather it was more like a business transaction where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power wealth and ensure that outsiders couldnt get in,positive
veronica despite her charm and good looks is certainly an outsider,positive
after a short love affair marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her,positive
however because she is beautiful and intelligent veronica has a chance to enter marcos world albeit not as his wife,positive
she decides to become a courtesan a class of women who were as welleducated as they were ravishing and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite,positive
a courtesan was not a mere prostitute they were afforded a special place in society and they were greatly revered respected and often envied,positive
at one point a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants,positive
veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother paola jacqueline bisset who was once a famed courtesan herself,positive
once she enters the lifestyle veronica finds that it suits her quite well,positive
she is allowed to read all the books she wants she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet including the awestruck marco,positive
their relationship develops into a playful bantering with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marcos advances,positive
in many ways their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love,positive
love the love not the man as her mother told her,positive
dangerous beauty which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice,positive
it has multiple plot lines including veronicas adversarial relationship with a court poet oliver platt her role in obtaining frances military assistance in venices battle against the turks and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition yet it is never confusing or overbearing,positive
much of the films success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role,positive
known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibsons ire in braveheart 1995 mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady,positive
she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan her character is intelligent witty and both sensual and vulnerable all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes,positive
the rest of the roles are also filled well including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in dark city have assured him a solid place in hollywood,positive
he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas,positive
oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy,positive
platt is a good actor but hes just too hard to hate,positive
jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was and even fred ward turns up in a small but moving performance as marcos uncle,positive
dangerous beauty is marshall herskovitzs sophomore directorial effort after the overlooked 1993 film jack the bear,positive
partnered with edward zwick herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television thirtysomething my socalled life and in the movies legends of the fall,positive
his directing style can be best described as transparent it never gets in the way of the story yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions,positive
he could have approached the film in any number of ways including overdosing on the sexual aspect which he wisely avoids,positive
dangerous beauty contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic but not so much that it seems exploitative,positive
herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli whose previous efforts include the highlystylized thriller kalifornia 1993 and abel ferraras dark scifi film body snatchers 1994,positive
bazelli captures the film in strong bold colors and be brings sixteenthcentury venice to life in wide panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery,positive
however the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood brazil the princess bride and the costumes by gabriella pescucci the age of innocence,positive
the only problem with dangerous beauty is that it doesnt stick with you,positive
its a good story welltold with interesting characters but its easy to shrug off once youve left the theater,positive
the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions but it never quite comes off because its simply too melodramatic and conventional,positive
herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion and like the rest of the film it carries no real weight despite the potential severity of the subject matter,positive
everyones heard about this movie and more specifically the scene,positive
everyones heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed no pun intended over and over,positive
and everyones got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance,positive
good,positive
thats what youre supposed to do,positive
oh if you are one of the ones who hasnt seen this yet or you somehow havent heard about what happens heres your spoiler warning,positive
deliverance was a real shocker for its time 1972,positive
major advances were being made in films and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry,positive
when it was first released it literally shocked the audiences,positive
it was something that for the most part had really never been seen on the big screen before among widerelease films with an r rating,positive
but by todays film standards and in todays world such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isnt as shocking although they can be even more graphic e g,positive
pulp fiction,positive
pulp fiction did it in a way and expanded on it in a way that it could even be interpreted as funny,positive
but in 1972 deliverance was no laughing matter,positive
the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory,positive
the initial leader of the group is lewis burt reynolds in his prime a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boonetype then any of the others,positive
joining him are ed jon voight bobby ned beatty and drew ronny cox,positive
the groups first objective is to find someone s to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip,positive
they make arrangements with a few mountain men who accept 40 00 for the task,positive
drew also has the famous dueling banjos competition with a local who is let us say genetically challenged,positive
the men then set off down the river with lewis also the master at canoeing leading the way,positive
everything seems to be going fine until the two canoes split up leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone,positive
they encounter two hillbillies armed with a shotgun who captured them,positive
ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men,positive
ed nearly receives the same cruelty but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapists back,positive
the other hillbilly gets away and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body,positive
disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film,positive
while attempting to make a quick paddle for it both canoes tip over,positive
drew who was without a life jacket was possibly shot and cannot be found,positive
lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition,positive
this leaves ed and bobby,positive
ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly alone with the bow and arrow,positive
the question arises if he will be able to handle himself as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer to which his comment i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing will have more meaning in the future,positive
deliverance is definitely a wild ride oops im doing it again,positive
it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic,positive
its definitely one of those must see movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade,positive
it was a crazy time in france what with the french revolution right around the corner,positive
king louis xv would soon die and his son would become king louis xvi,positive
such is the setting for beaumarchais the scoundrel about the controversial playwright spy and playboy pierreaugustin caron de beaumarchais,positive
beaumarchais was the author of the plays the barber of seville and the marriage of figaro,positive
today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas but back in 1773 when the movie takes place they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once,positive
the movie beaumarchais the scoundrel takes a lighthearted approach to its subject resulting in an inviting motion picture,positive
one of frances most expensive productions ever the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year,positive
now in theatrical release in the united states it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story,positive
the secret of the films success other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzacs costumes has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais,positive
with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile he mesmerizes the camera and the audience,positive
his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning,positive
in a land where court intrigue determines ones destiny constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy,positive
as our story starts we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship,positive
into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight,positive
beaumarchais who has been having an affair with the mans wife makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided,positive
that over with the fight is on,positive
with luchinis charisma it is hard to root for anyone other than him,positive
audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert in which he played the attorney,positive
although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin played by manuel blanc he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style,positive
michael epps warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jeanmarc kerdelhues lush but realistic looking sets,positive
jeanclaude petits music especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos make for an enchanting time at the movies,positive
director jeanclaude brisville who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which according to the press notes was just a series of historic vignettes,positive
the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie but the actors smooth it over with their goodhearted style,positive
typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water taking his bath,positive
one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man,positive
another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution,positive
all of this may sound like a dull historical drama but it is anything but,positive
the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts,positive
the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marietherese the real love of beaumarchaiss life,positive
but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him,positive
still with his beguiling smile one can never quite be sure if you should trust him,positive
the movie on the other hand can be trusted to deliver a high old time,positive
beaumarchais the scoundrel runs 1 41,positive
it is in french with english subtitles,positive
the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex and should be fine for most teenagers,positive
bob the happy bastards quickie review,positive
the matrix,positive
whats worse than y2k,positive
how about a fully digital future where nothing is real,positive
thats what computer programmer neo keanu reeves slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix a movie directed by the wachowski brothers the guys behind the hip thriller bound,positive
before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role hold on,positive
theres actually a story with depth here,positive
it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss who looks quite cool in leather i must say,positive
neo reeves is pretty much a key player in this fight although he really doesnt look it at first,positive
could this amateur be the one as fisburne thinks he is,positive
credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build something that few special effectsladen films seem to do these days,positive
theres plenty of effects to go around of course but at least theres a backbone to build them on as well,positive
reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy yet great,positive
i wish the villains werent quite so generic leftover gmen from looking for a sweet scifi actioner with plenty of stopmotion swooping camera angles and of course a motherlode of a helicopter explosion,positive
now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project,positive
bring it on,positive
the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily,positive
three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making,positive
they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house,positive
from there things become a little more complicated,positive
i can say with absolute assurance that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me,positive
although i know it was all a staged mockumentary theres no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you,positive
i didnt feel much upon initially watching it,positive
i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts,positive
i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend,positive
ive gotten chills every time ive brought it up since then,positive
this is not a movie that hits you right away,positive
instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine waits until you think everything is okay then it slowly starts to creep its way up into your mind,positive
this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch,positive
the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film so dont expect any steadicam shots or fancy camera work,positive
this is as real as it gets folks,positive
i dont recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera,positive
the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not,positive
this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera,positive
the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tapetofilm transfer done for the big screen,positive
word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras hours of deleted scenes alternate endings commentary the scifi channel special and others is being planned for release,positive
i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvds,positive
i know ill be first in line to buy one,positive
r,positive
i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater on a sunday afternoon,positive
when the movie was over and the audience was exiting i didnt hear one negative comment and i didnt have any to offer,positive
simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys simon ian michael smith and joe joseph mazzello and what destiny holds for both of them,positive
simon is a dwarf who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart,positive
surprisingly he does and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle,positive
simon thinks god has a plan for him a purpose for his life and his condition he just doesnt know what,positive
joe is an illegitimate child referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard whos mom ashley judd wont tell him who his father is,positive
simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem the people in the town dont really like him because he isnt natural,positive
even his own parents dont care about him and are disappointed they didnt have a normal son,positive
he is also harassed in church by the local pastor rev russell david strathairn and simons chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks,positive
the only person other than joe that really cares for simon is joes mom who he also looks up to as a mother,positive
it would be just simons luck that he would accidentally kills joes mom something you are told at the beginning of the movie,positive
joe now motherless as well as fatherless feels the need to find out who his real father is,positive
with the help of ben oliver platt the local drama teacher and joes moms current boyfriend before her death he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way,positive
most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny although not all of it is,positive
simon will also look for gods plan for him although he loses a little faith along the way,positive
starring in the first and last five minutes of the film is hollywoods newest dramatic actor jim carrey,positive
jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off and then tying it up just right,positive
this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway and he does a commendable job,positive
simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson this is his first film as director but he has written several films including the grumpy old men series,positive
he does an outstanding writing and directing job here the films structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly,positive
the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat,positive
the cast is excellent,positive
joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance,positive
joseph is outstanding for someone of any age not alone someone who just turned 15,positive
ian michael smith in his film debut has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation,positive
other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast,positive
i loved this movie it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year,positive
take your whole family to see simon birch it is a magnificent film an american masterpiece,positive
as feelgood formulaic as it may be in its own way shall we dance,positive
also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you dont often find in american films,positive
this japanese import tells the story of a middleaged accountant named sugiyama koji yakusho whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa tamiyo kusakari in the window of a dance school,positive
intrigued by her melancholy demeanor and slightly infatuated with her sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school and much to his amazement ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei,positive
meanwhile sugiyamas wife hideko hara becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights and sets a private detective on her husbands trail,positive
in a hollywood film you can bet that subplot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings,positive
in shall we dance masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls,positive
neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some meanspirited token rival,positive
suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them,positive
an opening prologue in shall we dance,positive
goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety,positive
its a forced message in a story which doesnt need such a culturespecific angle,positive
the dance school in shall we dance,positive
plays the role of a singles mixer with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities,positive
most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyamas coworker mr aoki naoto takenaka a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba,positive
sugiyamas awakening is less overt but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps,positive
its a delicate performance with a huge heart,positive
shall we dance,positive
is a fairly lightweight experience which makes its final half hour rather a long sit,positive
suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time including an unnecessarily detailed backstory for mai resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution,positive
it is here that shall we dance,positive
feels most hollywoodconventional attempting to blindside the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis,positive
suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together,positive
thats the real joy of dance shall we dance,positive
conveys its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt,positive
look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future,positive
some sort of decision had to be made and for better or worse it irrevocably altered the course of your existence,positive
from timetotime everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different,positive
perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action catching the 10 am train for example could have an equally profound yet less obvious impact,positive
maybe thats where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just a few seconds later,positive
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else and thats why theres no shortage of movies about this subject,positive
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance,positive
these themes weave their way through many of his movies including decalogue the double life of veronique and the triptych of blue white and red,positive
however they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action missing or catching a train changes the course of his life,positive
in his autobiography kieslowski on kieslowski the director describes his attraction to the concept this way the idea is rich and interesting that every day were faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which were completely unaware,positive
while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including in a way frank capras its a wonderful life sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths,positive
the road not taken approach isnt just a plot device either,positive
peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just a train,positive
the audience watches with evergrowing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has a family,positive
as her separate destinies diverge and then reconverge she becomes two completely different individuals,positive
that woman is helen played by gwyneth paltrow as a long dark haired brit,positive
one day after losing her job as an advertising executive she decides to return home in the middle of the day,positive
the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform,positive
in scenario 1 she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station,positive
on board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty,positive
minutes later in her flat she walks in on her lover gerry john lynch in bed with another woman jeanne tripplehorn,positive
in scenario 2 she misses the train and shortly thereafter is the victim of an attempted mugging,positive
she doesnt meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerrys infidelity,positive
juxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed in parallel from there,positive
on one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience,positive
but for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting a script with a few twists and a great deal of genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill,positive
one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less,positive
it shouldnt come as any surprise that the acting at least from three of the four leads is solid,positive
paltrow who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different is the standout,positive
she plays both of her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated platinumblond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man,positive
john hannah known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral is instantly likable,positive
john lynch taking a break from movies about irelands troubles does a good job presenting gerry as a inept selfish philanderer,positive
only jeanne tripplehorn who plays an overthetop vixen seems out of place,positive
her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring and its occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element,positive
one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice,positive
douglas mcferran who plays gerrys best friend russell is an absolute delight stealing every scene that hes in,positive
part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie,positive
on one occasion he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy,positive
on another occasion while laughing at gerrys plight with the women in his life he comments being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable,positive
but its not all in the dialogue,positive
mcferran tears into this part with relish his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a topnotch comedy,positive
this is the first feature film for peter howitt and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb,positive
the script is shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into a crowdpleasing whole,positive
sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies however,positive
for those who are so inclined its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe all while having a good time,positive
susan grangers review of bread and tulips first look pictures,positive
in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers rosalba licia maglietta an unhappy housewife from pescara finds herself and love in venice,positive
for the first time in years rosalbas on her own when shes abandoned at a highway rest area,positive
although her philandering husband antonio catania a plumbingsupply dealer orders her to stay there until shes picked up she impulsively accepts a ride to venice a bohemian paradise which shes never visited,positive
rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando bruno ganz a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning,positive
to support herself she gets a job working with a florist antonio catania,positive
filmmaker silvio soldini gently explores the blossoming of this bored middleaged middleclass woman with warmth and affection savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple new redandwhite dress with platformsoled espadrilles,positive
the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly particularly luminous licia maglietta and lowkey bruno ganz along with marina massironi as her nosy massagetherapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumberturnedprivate eye whos sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband whos discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house,positive
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 bread and tulips is a beguiling escapist 8,positive
as the summer ends its a magical getaway for mature audiences,positive
as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it the more pleased i was when i left,positive
first getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz if you liked scream youll love wild things,positive
campbell gives a stunning performance,positive
this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days,positive
oh yeah the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me,positive
now onto more serious stuff and with this film i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way,positive
wild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa,positive
im not saying that in a bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see,positive
however perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the films charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an r rating,positive
being mormon im bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film,positive
trouble is i have already seen it,positive
and i like it,positive
wild things is a film noir of the 90s filled with 40s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of 90s culture,positive
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color,positive
the actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film,positive
sure its all too good to be true but aint it fun to watch,positive
when movies like this come along sort of a better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it,positive
there will be people who dont want to admit liking what they see but i tell you most anyone who sees this will like it,positive
wild things begins at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into,positive
its almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone,positive
of course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous,positive
immediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time,positive
we can turn off our brains right,positive
wrong,positive
while you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesnt turn out that way,positive
the film begins in a classroom with nearly all the main characters present,positive
theres sam lombardo matt dillon a counselor for the students,positive
hes heading the class discussion,positive
theres also kelly van ryan denise richards a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam,positive
teaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubinvega who want to talk about sex,positive
cheers crimes boos,positive
what is a sex crime,positive
ray asks,positive
not gettin any,positive
one student responds,positive
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch,positive
however upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body,positive
and so wild things sets into motion,positive
quickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam doesnt want anything to do with her advances,positive
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him,positive
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep,positive
surprisingly thats really all i can tell you about the plot,positive
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists,positive
and whats more these plot twists are actually unpredictable,positive
going along the way of scream wild things maintains that films surprises and then adds even more to them,positive
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen,positive
and even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that its rather pleasing,positive
going back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief,positive
thankfully the convoluted plot doesnt give us much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off,positive
as for the critics who complain that the film is trashywell it is,positive
this is pretty much just one trashy film,positive
however it is the kind of trashy that isnt hard to watch,positive
its good trash in a sense,positive
one the screenplay knows that its not to be taken seriously and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story,positive
this varies everywhere from kellys mother theresa russell who is more of a caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulancechasing lawyer bill murray who wears a neckbrace to cover an insurance scam he is running,positive
bill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laughs,positive
and two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed,positive
wild things is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldnt and this movie breaks the boundaries,positive
instead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell dont worry,positive
its not as graphic as you might think,positive
the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene,positive
its very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it,positive
and for as long as i can remember i dont think i have seen an rrated film show an erect one before its not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too,positive
also during one scene late in the film there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillons characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating or if the actors refused to do it,positive
what first made me want to see wild things was its cast,positive
neve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released,positive
here however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead,positive
the closest role to this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was a nice girl,positive
campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent,positive
you can tell she will be around for a long time,positive
denise richards will also be around for a long time although she may be limited to the roles without much range,positive
here she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers,positive
hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability,positive
and then there is daphne rubinvega a newcomer to the movies,positive
she gives a very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half,positive
towards the end she does get a bigger part,positive
on the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist,positive
kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it,positive
you must have admiration though for what he did on screen,positive
and judging from many of the womens reactions in the theater to that shot they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right,positive
and then there is bill murray,positive
his performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the film,positive
as a whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage a troi,positive
director john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of a serial killer has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works,positive
his direction is smooth and stylish,positive
the visuals are striking filled with rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air,positive
however he seems more at home when the actors arent talking,positive
his flyby shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight,positive
the cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see a film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures,positive
then there is the music,positive
this was probably the most obvious thing to me as it set the perfect mood for the film,positive
its hard to describe in words so just see the film and listen to it,positive
its wonderfully composed and presented,positive
and be sure to stick around during the closing credits,positive
mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use while most comedies use it for outtakes,positive
he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events,positive
some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot but its an entertaining way to finish the film,positive
plus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun,positive
wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality nudity language and violence,positive
again the nudity is rather unnecessary but lets face itpeople want to see it,positive
so why not give it to them,positive
neve campbell admirably has a nonudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way to go neve,positive
the sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands,positive
one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating,positive
the language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity,positive
and i cant stress it enough dont allow kids under 18 to see this film,positive
the target age for the movie is the 1824 range and thats who should see it,positive
its definitely not for those under 18,positive
did i mention that this film is rated r however for those that do get a chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends to see it the next time,positive
as with his other stateside releases jackie chans latest chopsocky vehicle mr nice guy is contrived blockheaded and lacking in narrative logic,positive
but also like those other films it is a highly enjoyable ride,positive
once again chans screenwriters here edward tang and fibe ma have taken the easy way out and named their stars character simply jackie with no last name,positive
this jackie is a worldclass chef who cohosts a popular cooking show on australian television,positive
of course jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporters gabrielle fitzpatrick expose of a drug dealing ring,positive
other plot details involving a videotape and a biker gang are irrelevant in fact as is the case with most chan films the plot itself is just about irrelevant,positive
the sole purpose of mr nice guys existence are chans comic fight scenes and those here do not disappoint,positive
director samo hung who has a cameo role a longtime collaborator of chans does not waste any time putting chan in action diving headon into a wild shootout after a brief cooking show prologue,positive
other impressive set pieces follow most notably a chase in a mall which directly leads to some frenzied if cliched can you say fruit cart business involving a runaway carriage and an extended latefilm sequence at a construction site in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards cement mixers and a deadly buzzsaw,positive
none of the action sequences in mr nice guy are as spectacular as supercops thrilling helicoptertrain finale or rumble in the bronxs daring leap between two buildings nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor respectively,positive
but the action delivers even if the energy peters out before the films end the finale as spectacular as it is is a letdown for fans of chans athletic prowess,positive
filmed almost entirely in english even so the voices of some englishspeaking actors are laughably dubbed mr nice guy hints at jackie chans latest transition to hollywood productions he made illfated attempts with 1980s the big brawl and 1985s the protector next in the pipeline is rush hour a stateside production costarring chris tucker,positive
hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr nice guy for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands much like they have been before,positive
for those of us who werent yet born when the 1960s rock n rolled around monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies,positive
from otis redding to jimi hendrix janis joplin to the mamas and the papas and jefferson airplane to the who this documentary is jampacked with contagious energy,positive
but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves,positive
shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time,positive
sure some have painted their faces and smoke joints but d a,positive
pennebaker the war room moon over broadway surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience,positive
no matter who is watching it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul,positive
the excitement starts before the music even begins,positive
a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer she replies that she feels lucky to do so,positive
there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers tries to get in touch with dionne warwick,positive
and when one band is tuning up a member remarks finally a decent sound system,positive
you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isnt about vanity its about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it a twoway street,positive
this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience,positive
its impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain,positive
and while the lyrics to wild thing may not be all that complicated watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love,positive
even if you dont recognize every band you see on stage you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats,positive
the only drawback to the film is the ending which unfortunately i must reveal,positive
all the other bands big names then and still today got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time,positive
in contrast the last band on camera a wholly forgettable one gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time,positive
for a film thats only 78 minutes long thats too large of a chunk especially when previous acts are much more stimulating,positive
all in all monterey pop is a precious rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us,positive
the variety of music as well as the beautifully shot performances are easy to become immersed in,positive
if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular this is quickly dispelled,positive
its almost depressing to think that music this moving doesnt get made much anymore,positive
instead were stuck with nsync the backstreet boys and jennifer lopez all of whom should have stuck with modeling,positive
118 minutes not rated though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language,positive
mamoru oshii is a name that probably isnt very wellknown to most american audiences but perhaps it should be,positive
oshii was the director of last years bestknown japanese animated film import ghost in the shell and is known among fans of japanese animation or anime for making films with a deep philosophical bent,positive
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series,positive
in its many incarnationsgraphic novels manga two different runs of madeforvideo episodes original animation videos or oavs for short and a television series running to nearly fifty episodespatlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan,positive
set in the very near future though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived this atypical giant robot anime features the characters rather than the machinery as the primary focus,positive
as a whole patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan,positive
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains giant industrial robots known as labors an interesting play on words considering that robot is derived from the czech word for labor have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century,positive
with the rise of labors however has come a new menacelabor crime,positive
this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions using patrol labors to fight labor crime,positive
the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division sv2 who through no fault of their own have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness,positive
sometimes utterly hilarious sometimes almost deadly serious the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life,positive
those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers,positive
the story as has much of patlabor before centers around the controversial babylon project a gigantic seawall that will on its completion allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay,positive
this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists most notably the house of sea organization,positive
however the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist but from someone who is already dead,positive
shinohara heavy industries the premier labor manufacturer in japan if not the whole world has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors movement speed and efficiency by 30,positive
this hyper operating system hos for short has very quickly been installed into well over 90 of the nations labors including the patrol labors of sv2,positive
since that installation dozens of labors including a heavilyarmed military model have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos,positive
some wags have compared this to windows 95,positive
its up to asuma shinohara labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries to find the source of these problems before more laborsincluding sv2s ownfall victim to them and before hos drags his fathers company down with it,positive
as was the case with ghost in the shell if you just want a nobrainer actionfest this might not be the movie for you,positive
patlabor the movie is more of a psychological thriller a technological suspense drama,positive
it is closer perhaps to a chrichton novel than to an action movie crichton novels that have been made into action movies notwithstanding,positive
there are long thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo similar to sequences from ghost in the shell,positive
this movie is fraught with symbolismin fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism,positive
patlabors nearfuture setting is aside from the giant robots tromping around very similar to our own present day,positive
the film uses this setting to make its central point is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up,positive
are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new,positive
this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabors alternate1999 setting,positive
as far as the technical aspects of the film go referring to the subtitled version as thats the only one ive seen the film transfer is clear almost phenomenally so,positive
the animation quality is incredible though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to,positive
the oavs and tv series were more cheerful bettersuited to humor the movie however makes everyone look a great deal less cute and emphasizes that this is going to be for the most part a deadly serious storyline,positive
as far as cinematography goes there are many interesting moments in patlabor the movie,positive
i dont think i can recall ever seeing a fisheye perspective used in any other animated film save for ghost in the shell another oshii film or indeed in many other movies at all,positive
the cinematography is wellsuited to the storyline emphasizing what it needs to though a couple of scenes where characters features are exaggerated in anger may seem slightly strange to western audiences,positive
the audio track of patlabor the movie is in glorious hifi stereo and should be used to demonstrate home theater systemsit is that good,positive
even without headphones sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to come from that side,positive
giant robot footsteps are deep and booming,positive
the sometimesunderstated sometimesblaring score is crisp and clear and always right on the mark enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery,positive
as far as the subtitles go i have to say that theyre among the most easilyreadable subtitles ive ever seen for anything,positive
large enough that they dont strain the eyes but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen,positive
although it does have several action sequences in it most notably the climactic conclusion patlabor is foremost not an action movie,positive
although it is a superblyrealized film it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story and that could detract from some peoples enjoyment,positive
my,positive
youve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk,positive
the title is generic,positive
its meaningless,positive
and i cant believe its good business,positive
when you pick up the phone and dial 777film how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jeanclaude van damme movie the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot is called geez maximum risk,positive
yuck,positive
the movie itself deserves your attention,positive
for sweet bloody thrills this one beats the summer blockbuster competition handsdown,positive
only mission impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller and ill give maximum risk the edge simply because its not as slick as the tom cruise picture and therefore more gratifying in its execution,positive
much to my surprise van damme continues to develop as a pleasant unpretentious action hero,positive
his track record isnt as solid as schwarzeneggers but hes a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold,positive
in 1993 van damme worked with hong kongs premier hardcore action director john woo on a fairly lame movie called hard target,positive
if you can find a bootleg copy woos radically different directors cut is much better than what was eventually released,positive
this followup is directed by ringo lam city on fire full contact whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woos more operatic offerings,positive
the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woos subsequent broken arrow,positive
heres the rundown,positive
van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend jeanhugues anglade finds a corpse thats alains exact double,positive
turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother michael who has been killed by some russian heavies and some strangely american looking cops,positive
alain does some investigating,positive
he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia,positive
assuming michaels identity alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michaels girlfriend natasha henstridge the fbi and the russian mob in little odessa,positive
thats as much as you need to know,positive
the story is adequate but not overly involving and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment,positive
theres a love story too but i didnt find it terribly convincing partly because exmodel henstridge is too highstrung in her highprofile debut she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species,positive
shes great to look at and she can certainly read a line but what she does here cant really be described as acting,positive
of course acting isnt really what she was hired for i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van dammes,positive
the movie is exceptionally violent bordering on gratuity,positive
keep that in mind when planning your date,positive
the stunts are spectacular and the fact that you can spot van dammes standin makes his work no less impressive,positive
theres only so much you can do with a car wreck but this movie makes crisp effective use of pileups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies,positive
and lam has a surprising innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action,positive
the main difference between lam and woo i believe is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and doublebarreled points of view to make things run,positive
dont get me wrong when chow yunfat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woos hardboiled its an amazing moment,positive
but its a moment thats hard to reproduce in hollywood,positive
for one thing hollywood doesnt yet have chow yunfat,positive
while woos hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture,positive
the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city but lams use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on,positive
the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lams shooting style accentuating rather than amplifying the action,positive
the performances could have used some fine tuning in particular theres an annoying overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely and the movie doesnt always overcome the limitations of its genre,positive
the story is a little mundane although there are some effective moments involving van dammes unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had,positive
but its not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture and its doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity,positive
van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the mans best movie and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong hybrid,positive
american pie acknowledges a cold hard fact that most movies dont it is very difficult to get laid,positive
its four virgin heroes are jim biggs a chronic masturbator kev nicholas who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend reid oz klein a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning and finch eddie kaye thomas a germphobe his crass nickname is hilarious but i wont spoil it here who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member,positive
jim kev oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women its no wonder theyre horny all the time,positive
after a party at their studly friend stiflers seann william scott in the films sharpest performance house leaves them sexually unsatisfied the quartet make a pact to lose it by graduationspecifically prom night which is only a few weeks away,positive
american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds,positive
almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin whoopee,positive
all women are there to be ogled,positive
alyson hannigans perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch,positive
situations abound that defy logic only to arouse amuse its core audience adolescent boys,positive
to arouse nadias shannon elizabeth internet stripteasean unexpectedly raucous and guiltily pleasurable sequence,positive
to amuse jims lusty encounter with a hot apple pie,positive
what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids is a cast thats light years more appealing than that of say just one of the guys,positive
two more standouts klein and sctv s eugene levy,positive
klein plays a kindhearted athlete for the second time in a row after alexander paynes underappreciated election,positive
i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon,positive
levys is the most crowdpleasing performance and indeed its nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow,positive
american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents would let you watch growing up,positive
it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes much like john hughes movies did and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds dont you forget about me,positive
the picture ultimately has a healthy if obligatory attitude towards safe sexeven at their most libidinous american pies protagonists first whip out a condom,positive
the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible,positive
for its familiarity and for its charming leads i recommend american pie but the buzz on this film had me expecting something fresher,positive
as far as the new teen cinema goes its at the top of the heap,positive
dont say i didnt warn you about the party scene,positive
john von neumann progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos even without recourse to fasterthan light travel,positive
you send out selfreplicating robot ships which explore and radio back information,positive
it may take decades centuries or millennia but it can be done with achievable technology and doesnt require a magical fasterthanlight drive,positive
in the fifties british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer which would then engage in a realtime dialog with the aliens exchanging information and technologies and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned,positive
about thirtyfive years ago the bbc contracted with fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a miniseries called a for andromeda,positive
afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission the construction of a huge computer the computers analysis of life on earth and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication,positive
she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the thenunknown julie christie,positive
audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel andromeda breakthrough which played to equally high ratings,positive
dennis feldman whose previous credits include the golden child has never been noted for coherent wellstructured movie scripts they start out great and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl,positive
feldman writes good scenes but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie even with a previous version to use as a model,positive
now in species we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter gore and chases,positive
species features ben kingsley who is completely wasted in a badlywritten portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist,positive
forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script,positive
the species story is relatively simple we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 and have been receiving answers for two years,positive
note that in the 1970s we really didnt know diddly about the human genome structure and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings,positive
even today all we can do is give information about dna and how it works not a copy of human dna because we dont have it analyzed yet,positive
the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played by ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt,positive
the script begins to go off the deep end at this point when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shapeshift into any of several ugly alien life forms,positive
the first half of the film has something to offer as sil the alien girl struggles with her multiform existence changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos,positive
she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society with glaring gaps where her social skills should be,positive
her instincts are to mate and procreate and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area,positive
escaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her,positive
she goes on an eating binge spins herself a cocoon and emerges as an adult played by natasha henstridge who goes a long way toward recreating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960,positive
the pursuers michael madsen is an forrest whitaker is a convenient just as though the u s government actually had such people on call,positive
neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided,positive
whitakers role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek the next generations counselor cleavage,positive
the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina,positive
kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals too good to not work to the best of their abilities but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak,positive
h r gigers design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly,positive
the main fault of species is lack of originality it starts out with a wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then doesnt live up to it,positive
all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes with a few monsters tossed in,positive
there is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name species is just a sequence of scare scenes stuck together,positive
the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes but not rescued by them,positive
on the other hand as an exercise in scifi action adventure it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd,positive
species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but by and large its fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing,positive
my personal rating is three stars but knock one or two of those off if you dont enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters,positive
mpaa classification r violence gore nudity sex language,positive
stars ben kingsley michael madsen forest whitaker alfred molina marg helgenberger natasha henstridge directed by roger donaldson produced by frank mancuso jr and dennis feldman typed by dennis feldman cinematography andrzej bartkowiak music christopher young run time 108 minutes aspect ratio 2 35 1 from mgm opens 7 july 1995,positive
in 1995 brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept the audience isnt stupid,positive
from that they went on and created the most plotdriven intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years,positive
the result the usual suspects one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist,positive
the story is convoluted and is really confusing to read although easy to follow on screen,positive
special investigator kujan chazz palminteri grills verbal kint kevin spacey a crippled conman who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims,positive
kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis the rogue cop keaton gabriel byrne is actually dead,positive
kint relates the majority of the film in flashback beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a policestation lineup in new york city,positive
along with dour keaton kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus stephen baldwin mordantly sarcastic hockney kevin pollak and fenster benicio del toro whose speech is virtually incomprehensible,positive
together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from new yorks finest taxi service crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins,positive
what follows is a shellgame of violence and betrayal all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze,positive
the film is brilliantly compact its the shortest 90 minutes youll ever spend in a movie theater,positive
the cast is exceptional,positive
palminteri shines he is brutally honest a true cop one who is going after the whole story because its there,positive
byrne is terrific his brooding character his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro who is a riot as fenster,positive
del toro is brilliant his lines are a jumbled mess you cant understand a word the man says but it sure is damn funny,positive
baldwin is also very good he is careful methodical and cold a chilling character with a nasty streak of hotblooded sarcasm,positive
pollak is also terrific as usual a very good character actor,positive
however this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey,positive
spacey is simply breathtaking he is a force on screen giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze,positive
spaceys performance will be remembered for years for it is the best of his career it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years,positive
verbal kint is a clever storyteller weak oppressed and gleefully evil to the bone yet pitiful one who draws sympathy,positive
the film is a good one a decent film until the last 10 minutes,positive
what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history for me at least,positive
the revelation of keyser soze the closing gunfights it is something wondrous,positive
you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do,positive
kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful fastpaced furiously plotdriven movie with quirky characters phenomenal acting and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle,positive
mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb,positive
without furnishing too many details he concocts his story and lets it run hoping the audience gets it at the end,positive
we do,positive
this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created,positive
kudos also to singer and john ottman who created the score,positive
they both create what is a true filmnoir setting carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final jarring ending,positive
there are flaws more questions raised than answers lack of character development and no strong female characters save one,positive
however the plot and that stunning ending make up for all the flaws and more,positive
if you havent seen the movie rent it,positive
watch it,positive
then rewind the tape and watch it again,positive
trust me youll be amazed,positive
youve heard all the hype,positive
youve seen all their faces natalie portman the professional as queen amidala liam neeson schindlers list as quigon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting as obiwan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way as young anakin skywalker,positive
if youve read any reviews youve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy,positive
you also may have heard that this ones too kiddiefriendly and doesnt have enough content for adults,positive
believe the hype,positive
the effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidalas sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth,positive
but theres something missing here and it isnt budget or effects its everything money cant buy,positive
the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broadstroked and flat characters,positive
the most successful at this is liam neeson who as quigon jinn a jedi master to young obiwan kenobi has quiet dignity and a wise commanding presence,positive
he is the anchor to this movie as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out,positive
portmans queen amidala and mcgregors obiwan kenobi dont fare nearly so well,positive
amidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation comes off as stoic stilted and caricatured it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life,positive
and obiwan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has so little screen time that hes nothing but a robin to quigon jinns batman,positive
however mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity and he does a good job,positive
he also absolutely nails alec guiness obiwan in episode 4 6 scottish accent and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise,positive
in fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit and thats one of the problems with this film,positive
i would never call myself a star wars fan especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days but ive always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america,positive
however if you are the one person in america who hasnt seen the films at all or even recently or who doesnt bother to brushup on the names of obscure characters you may be hopelessly lost,positive
for example one of the films main nefarious characters is senator palpatine,positive
for those of you not recently steeped in star wars trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vaders master in return of the jedi and empire strikes back,positive
so obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful,positive
a lot of the movie is like that,positive
r2d2 and c3po make token appearances and its obvious that lucas is banking on the audiences preexisting fondness for them,positive
because he doesnt do much to add to it in any way,positive
same goes for jabba the hutt who doesnt look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy,positive
even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leias home planet which we never actually see that gets blown up in star wars show up or are mentioned briefly in passing,positive
whats the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films,positive
the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty,positive
theres no meat no substance that makes you want to love the characters as they are not as they will be,positive
another problem is that there are actually too many alien characters in the film,positive
i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters,positive
and jar jar binks a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended as comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast,positive
unlike chewbacca and c3po who got their humanity if youll pardon the expression from their interactions with the human characters jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles,positive
furthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot,positive
oddly this isnt just my judgment lucas has said that he designed this film for kids,positive
well hes done a good job,positive
the hero of this film of course is young anakin but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eightyearold boy,positive
thats not jake lloyds fault though he does a good job of being a cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him,positive
thats another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader,positive
warning spoilers ahead,positive
in my opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakins future evil in the film,positive
the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and theres nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie,positive
he has a doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine,positive
but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isnt all hearts and roses is yodas hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under quigon jinn,positive
his explanation,positive
his future is clouded,positive
warning major spoiler ahead,positive
enter at your own risk,positive
of course the noble quigon dies at the hand of darth maul a scarylooking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts but has turned to the dark side,positive
this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his doublesided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup,positive
because quigon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force obiwan quigons young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself,positive
so at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begins with obiwan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker,positive
did this story need to be told,positive
i would say no,positive
but is it a worthwhile movie to see,positive
absolutely,positive
if you dont enter the theater with jedisize expectations and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie,positive
the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation,positive
the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight,positive
and yoda and young obiwan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler happier time,positive
above all this is a fun movie,positive
not deep not meaningful and not profound,positive
but fun,positive
maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to cowrite the script and the guy who directed empire will direct,positive
because if lucas does the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most potential,positive
as i write the review for the new romantic comedy youve got mail i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet,positive
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the worlds biggest paid commercial for america online,positive
and i wonder is that so bad,positive
well the commercial part is,positive
as for the movie well as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan i think ill be okay,positive
to paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews i admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act,positive
they are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia i like him best when hes suitably obnoxious,positive
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when hes going to get the girl the only question is how,positive
meg ryan americas high school sweetheart can act,positive
shes had a handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally i must not mention what she does due to the well um you get the idea and if you dont get the movie fantastic,positive
but i like her best when shes well perky,positive
she is so adorably that together with hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime,positive
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples but i dont really know,positive
all i know is that i just like them both,positive
they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thats really hard to resist and im not going to even try,positive
theyre just really really cute sweet and charming,positive
hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle,positive
here the setup is a little different,positive
kathleen kelly ryan owns a small childrens bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her,positive
she is successful beautiful and dates a wellknown columnist with very radical idea kinnear,positive
she is also having an affair of sorts,positive
you see kathleen with the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny152,positive
they have a strictly undetailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is,positive
ny152 happens to be joe fox hanks a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of megabookstores run by his father coleman,positive
fox books has decided to open a store on the west side right across from a little childrens bookseller named shop around the corner run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly,positive
every morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight to the death,positive
its a charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have,positive
it also has the great sense of being a classic romance there is no lets have sex tonight mantra if youll excuse my bluntness,positive
this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love,positive
hmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up to use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness,positive
you know its going to happen the question is now,positive
thankfully ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey kinnear chappelle and a host of others including a great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids,positive
its all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good,positive
hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is,positive
he is i believe americas greatest actor,positive
does he show it here,positive
nah,positive
but hes still tom hanks and shes still meg ryan,positive
which is what this movie boils down to,positive
its pure confection,positive
all the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script its all really sweet,positive
there are some immense flaws like pacing,positive
the last third of the movie really doesnt work as well as i would have liked and for a romantic comedy its slow,positive
once hanks knows the secret it gets really slow,positive
i even looked at my watch a couple times to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for so that i could get home at a reasonable hour,positive
the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated,positive
email,positive
when my kids are my age i dont know what well be using,positive
but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history,positive
they just work together and its nice to see,positive
it gives you well a smile,positive
the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake,positive
i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was,positive
ive always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed,positive
you see mankind has three abilities he needs to survive the ability to think entertain and procreate,positive
movies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well id rather not think about that,positive
i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night,positive
and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had,positive
hanks was the driving force behind one of the years best films in saving private ryan which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world,positive
hes also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment,positive
tom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie,positive
its a sweet lovely affair with a technology twist,positive
it may be a long commercial but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face,positive
deep rising is one of those movies,positive
the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us,positive
it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god screw that it says boldly lets see some computer generated monsters rip into decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors,positive
heh,positive
them wacky monsters gotta love em,positive
of course since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story hollywood must give that little extra oumph to get people in theaters,positive
that is where deep rising fails which is a good thing,positive
confused,positive
let me explain,positive
despite all them flashy effects and big explosions deep rising is still at heart a good ol b movie,positive
luckily its a very good b movie,positive
the worst cliches in movie history are a b movies bread and butter,positive
therefore things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre,positive
of course we know theres a big slimy creature behind that door that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive,positive
we just dont know when or how horrible it will be,positive
i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high,positive
imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually well pretty darn funny at times,positive
a funny b movie,positive
well thats new,positive
these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh,positive
except for a few unintended laughs once a while,positive
and before you know it treat williams wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen,positive
hey i know them guys and gal from a couple of other movies,positive
cool,positive
familiar faces,positive
so far so good,positive
our man treat is the hero hell live,positive
wes is a staple of b movies he is the token victim,positive
we know hell buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out,positive
famke is the babe nuff said,positive
there is also a guy with glasses the guy with glasses always dies a black person b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies never fails and a very funny nerdy guy,positive
ah,positive
comic relief,positive
how can we possibly explain having to kill him let,positive
him live,positive
after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home,positive
i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew,positive
please kill me,positive
suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times went ewwww about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing,positive
im a man we nottice these things,positive
all in all id recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door but,positive
bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you,positive
the acting is decent the effects top rate,positive
how to best describe it,positive
put together the jet ski scene from hard rain the bug attacks from starship troopers a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming dont go there hes behind you and you end up with deep rising,positive
for creepy crawly goodness tight tshirts major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water,positive
one of the sweetest tales to ever be made its a wonderful life isnt perfect but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results,positive
probably the greatest feelgood film of all time its a wonderful life aims for the heart and strikes with a golden arrow,positive
on christmas eve george bailey stewart is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls,positive
you see george is in trouble and he has always helped others who needed it,positive
this one time however god answers his prayers and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence travers to try and save george,positive
clarence has got his own problems however,positive
clarence is an angel without his wings and each time the bell rings the wings pass him by,positive
the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel,positive
but before clarence can save george he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george baileys life,positive
we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brothers life sacrificing his college education to save the family business sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else,positive
when the bank his family owns is in trouble george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isnt sold to the evil mr potter barrymore who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls,positive
one christmas potter gets his chance,positive
uncle billy bailey mitchell loses 8 000 of the banks money,positive
without the money the bank must close down,positive
george is stuck in a tremendous bind and contemplates suicide,positive
clarence the faithful servant is there just to pick him up and to show him what bedford would be like without george,positive
this is all a leadin to the very famous last scene where george finally sees what true happiness is about,positive
its a wonderful life does have its faults,positive
the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details especially in the treatment of women and men,positive
the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90s like something out of a revisionist look,positive
all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film,positive
there are however endearing moments in all of this,positive
capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable,positive
the story is hackneyed and the ending feels well a little too sugarish,positive
theres this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything especially the sequences where george is either in trouble or helping somebody,positive
its a little too nice for my liking at times,positive
there is however enough humor enough wit and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part which would be the most difficult,positive
but watching its a wonderful life is never boring or difficult its always interesting right until the finale which for all its sugar makes delightful sense and is beautifully done,positive
capra does have his monumental cliches but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection,positive
donna reed is perfect as the loving obeidient wife and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr potter,positive
everyone else is magnificent including bert and ernie ward bond and frank faylen,positive
there is a general sense of goodness as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film and they relish that,positive
stewart however is the king of all of this,positive
he is sometimes awkward especially when saying merry christmas to all objects animate or inanimate,positive
but he is james stewart and hes lovably delightful throughout the film,positive
have i complained,positive
i shouldnt have,positive
this is a really good movie,positive
no this is a great movie,positive
better yet this is a phenomenal movie,positive
there is a reason classics are invented to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life,positive
this is one of those films,positive
it is a feelgood movie something people complain a little too much about,positive
but capras reworking of a christmas carol is the greatest christmas movie of all time,positive
there ive said it,positive
i have to admit the first time i saw this i saw it with my family including my 11 year old kid sister,positive
they all loved it,positive
they loved george his wife his troubles and the beautiful ending,positive
is it a little too sugarcoated,positive
maybe,positive
no matter,positive
this is a film that should be watched time and time again with families around a coffee table and eggnog on the plate,positive
it is a film that just makes you feel good about life family and hope,positive
it is the perfect christmas film flaws and all,positive
it is frank capras greatest acheivement and that really does say a lot,positive
for about 121 out of 129 minutes this movie is flawless,positive
the rest can be excused no film is perfectly flawless,positive
i cant get over how much i love this movie and how much you will after watching it digesting it and sitting with your family appreciating how special life really is,positive
if theres a beast in men it meets its match in women too,positive
starring sarah patterson angela lansbury tusse silberg david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus,positive
in recent years there has been a trend in the field of fantasy writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world investing it with new life and energy,positive
in modern times fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased they have become trite adventures involving leering witches friendly dwarves and cuddly talking animals,positive
but in their original forms fairy tales have a dark wicked edge,positive
crows tear out the eyes of cinderellas sisters a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version,positive
hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven,positive
writers have become fascinated by the bloodier morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots,positive
before this trend was in vogue angela carterwhose stories always have a dark wicked subversive edgehad been reinventing fairy tales for years,positive
in the company of wolves she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood enlivening it with werewolves rolls royces and a visit from satan,positive
the story is structured as a dream occurring in the mind of rosaleen sarah patterson an adolescent girl about whose real life we learn very little,positive
within the dream there are a number of inset stories most told by dreamrosaleens grandmother angela lansbury and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing suggestive ways,positive
the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister contemporary fairy tale,positive
i say surprisingly because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong,positive
and there are ways in which it does,positive
the performances are mediocre except for lansburysshe finds the right note for the prim applecheeked granny the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales,positive
the soundtrack synthheavy reminded me of bad 80s horror movies as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes,positive
probably stateoftheart at the time they are now laughable,positive
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film he transcends the poor effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic of otherness,positive
one of the problems in adapting fullblown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader rather than being subjected to the realism of the screen,positive
part of me would love to see an adaptation of the lord of the rings but on the other hand i know that any filmmakers recreation of ents hobbits and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind,positive
this makes jordans accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery,positive
the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of urreality,positive
the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant,positive
the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly,positive
the peasant village is rustic and cozy the woods old and hoary,positive
this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart subtle literate script a script which is as good as youd expect from jordan himself an accomplished fiction writer and carter,positive
for carter the cauldron of story is a witches brew bubbling over with primal ingredients mistshrouded forests ancient graveyards virginal girls and wise women wolves with glowing eyes,positive
she adeptly blends them all together,positive
there is a symbolic richness to the film everything is permeated with a sense of significance,positive
the point of it all i think is to represent a girls ritesofpassage on an unconscious primordial level,positive
a nightjourney through the forest from the village to the grandmothers home is the crux of the company of wolves,positive
dont stray from the path rosaleen is told again and again and the path is both literal and figurative the path through the forest and the path of life,positive
staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleens elders,positive
carter and jordan never conventional explore what goes on when you leave the path,positive
those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate,positive
this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves but the werewolves connote many things death sex knowledge,positive
if straying from the path leads to death then its not a good ideabut if thats what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge and therefore power then maybe its worth the risk,positive
when you leave the path the world becomes a dangerous ambiguous place but its full of potential,positive
and its certainly more interesting than the disney version,positive
airplane is considered among many to be the epitome of satire filmmaking,positive
after all its brought to us by one of the best known satire teams,positive
even if most people dont recognize the names behind the films they are bound to recognize the titles airplane top secret the naked gun and hot shots to name a few,positive
but although the zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 airplane,positive
remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debuts,positive
in the seventies disaster films seemed to be at an all time high,positive
films like earthquake the towering inferno and the poseidon adventure were big hits,positive
there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane a series that spanned the entire decade,positive
and so in 1980 we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film,positive
this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean,positive
it had to do with bad fish,positive
airplane is the story of ted striker robert hays an exfighterpilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six er seven comrades,positive
unable to stop living in the past teds world fell apart,positive
he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job and eventually as we begin this film is getting dumped by his lover flight attendant elaine dickinson julie hagerty,positive
in a desperate attempt not to lose her ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working,positive
unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her which leaves him wallowing in selfpity,positive
in the midst of it all something happens,positive
someone gets sick,positive
then another,positive
then another,positive
soon the whole plane is full of deathlyill chicagobound people,positive
and when the pilots get sick played by peter graves kareem abduljabbar and frank ashmore who will save the day,positive
gee i wonder,positive
of course the main draw here is the nonstop whizbang comedy with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags,positive
although i had seen this movie a few times before i was still laughing thru the entire thing,positive
the most fun character by far is the doctor played by leslie nielsen,positive
hes a dry subtle sterotypically straightfaced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film,positive
in a film like this youre not really expecting an elaborate production so one cant complain about the amateurish quality,positive
what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny played by stephen stucker,positive
this character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny,positive
i dont know why he was put in there and i dont think anybody will find a good excuse,positive
and when the film nears an end it slows down quite a bit almost getting old,positive
you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long,positive
aside from that airplane,positive
is really a topnotch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic,positive
it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends especially if they havent seen it,positive
and if they ask what the plot is just tell em its a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film but thats not important right now,positive
if youve seen the film youll understand,positive
warning this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film failsafe,positive
if you havent seen the film yet proceed with caution,positive
nutshell a relevant intelligent suspenseful drama,positive
still powerful today even after the end of the cold war,positive
failsafe usa 1964 drama 111 minutes,positive
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e youngstein directed by sidney lumet,positive
review by jamahl epsicokhan,positive
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesnt have a winning side and a losing side,positive
in a nuclear confrontation everybody loses and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire worldassuming the world survives,positive
the ideaand perhaps the only real optionis to avoid war at all costs,positive
this is the theme of sidney lumets failsafe a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler,positive
failsafe takes place during the heart of the cold war the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word communism,positive
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws,positive
five u s bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america,positive
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers,positive
suddenly out of contact and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives the bomber pilots cannot be recalled and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike,positive
a great deal of failsafe s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u s bombers from reaching russias bordersat any cost,positive
the plot is compelling and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios,positive
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails,positive
general bogan frank overton taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself henry fonda is powerlessthe fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated preprogrammed system that may not be stoppable simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a nowin situation winnable,positive
the events in failsafe are fascinating because theyre anything but predictable but the real reason failsafe works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot,positive
a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war communism the cold war and the united states role in all of it,positive
most of this is through the films use of the character groeteschele walter matthau an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who incidentally is on the presidents advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war,positive
many of the films most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices,positive
early in the film he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of strategy in a nuclear assault to minimize casualties,positive
whats the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead,positive
a guest asks impatiently,positive
forty million groeteschele responds wryly,positive
the problem with groetescheles mindset is that he believes nuclear combat to be a viable method of war,positive
the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals,positive
groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over,positive
yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off as general black dan oherlihy has often recommended,positive
on the contraryaccording to groeteschele that would lead to russia having more nuclear weapons than the u s which would clearly put america at a disadvantage,positive
such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race,positive
failsafe clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war and likewise it becomes a central theme in the film,positive
why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over,positive
is it wise,positive
is it even logical,positive
no not really,positive
although failsafe is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial onesided sort of way,positive
again this is achieved through groeteschele who is easily the films most important character in terms of the largertheme significance,positive
in addition to providing the central pronuclear war voice that the film warns against he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism,positive
the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib,positive
one of groetescheles logical trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that its merely absurd,positive
he labels the average marxist an unfeeling calculating machine that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself,positive
groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u s drops the warhead on moscow the soviets will instantly surrender for to retaliate would invite countermeasures that would further destroy russias home soilwhich must be preserved at all costs,positive
groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revengeas any normal person would,positive
the irony here is groetescheles own mechanical theorizing,positive
he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesnt even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns,positive
once the film makes it evident that turning the u s bombers will be impossible the question becomes what the consequences of destroying moscow will be,positive
just how will the soviet unions leader react and what can the president do to convey his best intentions,positive
just how does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an mishap,positive
with the help of his translator buck larry hagman the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity with lumets long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader,positive
without getting into too much detail i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances,positive
that is as sensible as a nuclear incident can probably be,positive
it does accomplish what it must it avoids an allout war something that simply isnt possible because of its alltooreal consequences,positive
dramatically the ending is quite powerful and the use of oherlihys character as the symbolic matador providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the films opening is particularly appropriate,positive
failsafe is a production of a major hollywood studio released by columbia pictures and it has the structure of a hightension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film,positive
nevertheless under lumets direction and walter bernsteins intelligent adaptation of burdicks and wheelers novel the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded,positive
the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming,positive
but it was the conscious human choice to initialize this automatic arming that failsafe also finds dangerous,positive
in retrospect the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century,positive
its just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down rather than continuing groetescheles dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown,positive
a sci starring jack nicholson pierce brosnan annette benning glenn close martin short and other stars,positive
a warner bros picture,positive
the martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie,positive
before entering the cinema i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like,positive
many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish and there was no point to it all,positive
how wrong they were,positive
i left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema,positive
the story is about martians attacking earth,positive
using ray guns hooray,positive
they generally cause havoc around the u s and other countries,positive
nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion and also taking advice from his loopy officials,positive
but basically its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth,positive
the way people are killed by the ray guns is great they is a hillarous and mildly disturbing scene involving a martian lady a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding,positive
but most of all this film is fun,positive
the martians are full of character the performances are spot on and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable,positive
the film is a million times better then the dire independance day and is a real tribute to the tacky 50s invasion movies,positive
they are is a great score by danny elfman and lots of laughs,positive
this has to be the best invasion ive seen for a long time,positive
you dont have to know poker to like rounders but it might help,positive
that a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new yorks cardshark underground astoundingly doesnt limit its accessibility even for those who cant tell royal and straight flushes apart,positive
rounders success then is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with,positive
the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp but you dont have to speak the language to understand the words a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show,positive
matt damon fresh off his good will hunting hot streak is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling,positive
but after losing all of his tuition money in a killer highstakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb john malkovich deliciously hammy he shifts his focus to scholarly matters leaving his true area of expertise far far behind,positive
things change however when mikes old buddy worm edward norton reenters his life it seems worm just out of jail owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs and is counting on his friends superlative skills to help him pay off the debt,positive
that rounders story quickly molds itself into a conventional predictable tale of redemption doesnt hinder its potency,positive
director john dahl infamous for his neonoirs red rock west and the last seduction gets extremely convincing mileage out of the beenthere donethat plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm,positive
damon and norton bring so much to their roles that theyd be worth catching even if rounders ultimately folded but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning,positive
any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight,positive
if only the other character interaction was as successful rounders might merit consideration when it comes time to number the years best films,positive
current it girl gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mikes girlfriend jo aware and weary of his seedy past but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective,positive
john turturros aging mentor and famke janssens tempting siren both interesting sketches are hampered by the same limited screen time,positive
and as a wizened judge the great martin landau makes memorable a role thats mostly a plot device hes on hand mostly to sortof save the day and provide a voice for rounders moral,positive
that moral by the way is our destiny chooses us and its something of a surprise when rounders supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect mike does learn from his mistake but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be,positive
in the end rounders sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture,positive
the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions the movie espouses no matter what they might be,positive
here lowrent lowlifes like worm just arent cut out for the cards,positive
screenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture thats often generalized by movies even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene,positive
inside every adventurous filmgoer there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting and thats the precise allure of rounders,positive
it ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partiallyrealized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites weve seen before because the final destination is a satisfying one,positive
in the end rounders holds a winning hand,positive
it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of the horse whisperer the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to projection difficulties,positive
robert redfords film version of nicholas evans bestselling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december going headtohead with titanic but is only now making its much anticipated debut,positive
this strategic,positive
delay has allowed the horse whisperer to compete sans fanfare against some smaller unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office,positive
no matter,positive
redfords film stands head and shoulders above james camerons oceangoing tragedy especially in the writing and acting departments,positive
whatever the reasons for its postponement the horse whisperer supports the old adage better late than never,positive
redford has taken evans book and given it the big screen treatment,positive
while parts of the horse whisperer are epic in scope and vision especially the aerial travelogue that maps out this great country of ours its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast,positive
when her daughter grace is involved in a terrible riding accident harddriven fashion editor annie maclean kristin scott thomas devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and graces beloved horse pilgrim,positive
refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faithhealing cowboy of sorts called tom booker redford who has a way with horses and perhaps with people too,positive
undeterred by toms initial reluctance to get involved annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal,positive
redfords film unfolds slowly and lovingly echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds,positive
the films a little long and even if you havent read the book its pretty obvious where its headingbut these are minor complaints,positive
redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other but its scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role,positive
dianne wiest chris cooper lone star and sam neillbetter than ive seen him beforeround out the respectable supporting cast,positive
and the directors respect for horses is clearly in evidence,positive
one word of warning however while brilliantly shot the accident scene involving an outofcontrol truck is extremely disturbing,positive
redfords canvas is huge and exquisite,positive
he doesnt hesitate to incorporate vast sprawling vistas of the american northwest spectacular snowcapped mountain ranges azure skies and shimmering fields of wheatall are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardsons viewfinder,positive
veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity since the horse whisperer is dances with wolves by way of out of africa oscar winners both for barry,positive
fortunately barrys replacement thomas newman contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate human conditionssonorous stringladen passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic introspective movements ripe with nuance,positive
the horse whisperer is that rare kind of movie it looks good it feels good and by golly it does you good,positive
the wait it turns out was well worth it,positive
it was with great trepidation that i approached mary the farrelly brothers latest film,positive
i knew the film would be funnythe trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see,positive
but i also knew the film would be an equalopportunity offender attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon,positive
i figured the film would be raunchy maybe another lucky escapee from nc17 hell,positive
i may laugh but would i feel better in the morning,positive
i neednt have worried,positive
mary is the sweetest warmest allout laughandgrossfest this side of animal house,positive
surprisingly the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers,positive
they make laughter the toughest job for a filmmaker to do look easy,positive
the plot is typical,positive
thirteen years ago geeky ted ben stiller lucked out in having dazzling mary cameron diaz go with him to the senior prom,positive
as luck would have it on that very day he was hospitalized,positive
why i shall not tell but i assure you it isnt pretty,positive
he hires a private investigator to find her pat healy matt dillon,positive
he becomes one of the great comic villains,positive
upon finding her he too is lovestruck and so pursues her lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped,positive
it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been doublecrossed and goes to get her for himself,positive
would the geek get the girl,positive
puhlease,positive
the ending is pure hollywood no surprises there,positive
but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers hair gel the mentally disabled the physically handicapped interracial marriages homosexuals skin conditions serial killers tanning and druggedup dogs,positive
the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame,positive
and yet for all the targets that are hit the film maintains its sweet tone,positive
mary playing the straight role is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful,positive
she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother warren w,positive
earl brownmiles away from the cameraman in scream,positive
marys sunniness carries the film hereit compliments the belowbelt gags that come at you,positive
cameron diaz makes her totally charming and the audience respects her even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window,positive
ben stiller also fares very well totally changing his image from his reality bites and flirting with disaster straight men to being a how to say it a complete loser,positive
braces greasy long hair not too bright and very very funny,positive
dillon is exceptionally creepy especially with his capped teeth,positive
and rounding out the cast is teds friend dom chris elliot tanning addict magda lin shaye modern chorus ron lichman and marys sweet mom markie post where has she been,positive
not everything works,positive
chris elliots role skin blemishes and all becomes merely tasteless and boring,positive
theres lousy dialogue about eightminute vs seven minute exercise tapes,positive
and there are long stretches without much going on,positive
but the wait is worth it,positive
when those extraordinary sequences hit the entire theater erupted with howls tears,positive
bellyaches that in some sequences carried over to the following scene,positive
the farrelly brothers have finally done it,positive
yes there are some raunchy bits but when it is all over its not nearly as bad as it could have been,positive
while tasteless it didnt cross any lines at least not with me,positive
while raunchy it wasnt nearly as bad as porkys or boogie nights,positive
and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick,positive
after the funny but sour kingpin left a negative aftertaste in my palate comes the funniest sex farce since a fish called wanda,positive
approach this with an open mind and you will reap the benefits hugely,positive
kevin smith is like a big kid,positive
his humor is that of a sophisticated juveniles,positive
he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books having also written a few,positive
he also has a cult following mostly composed of teenagers college students and smiths own fellow adolescentminded grownups,positive
smith is hilarious in person and in writing but when he tries to be earnest and moralize that is when he goes wrong,positive
kevin smith is a better writer than director and hell be the first to tell you that,positive
that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavyhanded,positive
great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them,positive
this was true in the overrated chasing amy and it is true for dogma as well,positive
that is not to say smiths message is a bad one,positive
in dogma smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and gods desires is superior to anyone elses,positive
basically dogmatism is bad,positive
changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight they also know what is best for you whether you like it or not,positive
this is not exactly a new message in movies see inherit the wind but i have no problems with recycling old ones particularly since dogmas protesters are proving smiths point,positive
smiths own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book,positive
but this is smiths personality and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible or koran etc correctly or if there even is a correctly and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns,positive
the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany linda fiorentino being chosen by voice of god metatron alan rickman to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels bartleby ben affleck and angel of death loki matt damon,positive
along the way forgotten thirteenth apostle rufus chris rock stripper muse serendipity salma hayek and slacker duo jay and silent bob jason mewes and kevin smith himself come to bethanys aid,positive
fallen muse azrael jason lee proves to be the behindthescenes manipulator for all the chicanery,positive
the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smiths points and in itself has little dramatic momentum,positive
among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman jesus was black and the bible was written by a bunch of racist misogynistic white men,positive
of course kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself,positive
they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic,positive
smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie,positive
when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes smith thought it might give validation to protesters claims that the film was sacrilegious but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke,positive
the films humor is uneven,positive
some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burningbush kind of entrance,positive
but many of the films jokes just bomb as in virtually anything involving salma hayeks serendipity,positive
also some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away,positive
still smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace,positive
among the actors fiorentino and rickman stand out by far,positive
fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight,positive
damon and affleck are fairly lackluster,positive
rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith,positive
but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob who recur in all of smiths movies are much more in line with smiths brand of humor,positive
bud cort george carlin janeane garofalo guinevere turner and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances,positive
before you read my review you gotta know that i love woody allen,positive
this is a very important note because allens films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone,positive
i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius while others see him as a dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again,positive
i love most of his films but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s,positive
in fact why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me,positive
if you look at the quality of those films youll hear what im saying,positive
the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives,positive
in fact i secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just to reenergize or something but it doesnt appear as though he has any intention of doing that,positive
so here i am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old,positive
plot the year is 1940 and woody allen is a topnotch insurance investigator,positive
his methods are very oldfashioned and apparently out of date,positive
a new employee hunt has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency,positive
the two do not like each other,positive
one night they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician and unbeknownst to them placed under his control,positive
soon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer,positive
critique a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies with the fasttalking witty banter between coworkers a catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such as the veronica laketype sexpot oneliners galore and a fluffy if inconsequential plotline,positive
on the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy,positive
the sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man,positive
but it wasnt not long before i was fully engaged by the characters entertained by the many zingers delivered backandforth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick,positive
i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old parody and actual reinvention note therons entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool,positive
of course films like this with little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors to keep you interested in the quickfire dialogue and once again allen does a great job in playing his character who for once isnt his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude,positive
he actually plays a macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in which hes hypnotized,positive
but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt an actress who i was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time,positive
anyway shes really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men and doesnt miss a beat of allens fastpaced dialogue,positive
i didnt care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left a room but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did yum,positive
yum,positive
harumph but i digress,positive
so lets recap,positive
a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score some funny oneliners especially in the second half a decent plotline although you shouldnt expect a real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around,positive
i cant say that this is even remotely close to any of allens best work but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through,positive
its probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute oldschool kind of vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion,positive
little known facts about this film and its stars annie hall 1010 celebrity 510 everyone says i love you 510 husbands and wives 910 mighty aphrodite 510 small time crooks 710 when harry met sally 1010 youve got mail 410,positive
the verdict spinechilling drama from horror maestro stephen king featuring an outstanding oscarwinning performance from kathy bates,positive
geez french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this,positive
sorry nonbritish readers may not be familiar with french and saunders my apologies,positive
the pair are british comediennes jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in absolutely fabulous who did a series of film spoofs a few years back including alien the exorcist and misery,positive
needless to say amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates the resemblance was quite uncanny dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunders legs,positive
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch and although ive now seen the film a couple of times now that hobbling scene was no less disturbing,positive
im still left screaming at the telly in revulsion,positive
that may be the most memorable scene but its certainly not the only worth watching,positive
stephen king whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale,positive
its a nicely crafted psychological horror which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon james caan,positive
rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes bates who introduces herself as the writers number one fan he soon becomes her prisoner,positive
both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance for which she won an oscar work arminarm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruitcake or is that fruity as a nutcake,positive
bates relishes her demanding role and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece,positive
at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour at times shes a rather tragic character and more often than not shes just damned scary,positive
this is basically a very simple tale but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity,positive
its an involving engrossing experience and considering its basically a twohander mainly set in one locale its a remarkable piece of cinema,positive
there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences this one relies solely upon rob reiners stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan,positive
oh i havent really mentioned caan yet he does a good job as the writer whos a prisoner of his own success annie is obsessed with him and his books,positive
but as you no doubt gathered from the above bates is well and truly the star of the show,positive
along with the pig of course,positive
anyway the tension is builtup with masterful aplomb and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense,positive
theres the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerveshattering lengths to poison her wine,positive
he succeeds but she,positive
knocks the glass over,positive
i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well,positive
in the immortal words of homer j simpson doh,positive
other nervewracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house,positive
we cut to annie in her car shes on her way home he,positive
realises this and tries to get back to his room cut,positive
to the car again shes getting near will he make it,positive
ok so these sequences arent exactly original nor perhaps unpredictable but they work,positive
boy do they work,positive
if a film has you on the edge of your couch biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense then its doing something right,positive
of course the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned hobbling,positive
annie realises her captive has been out of his room and shes going to stop him once and for all,positive
cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer and i feel ill just thinking about it,positive
nasty,positive
it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho,positive
and then were given one of the most ridiculously overthetop fight scenes ive ever seen,positive
she gets hit over the head with a typewriter set on fire head smashed against the wall and she just wont die,positive
sheldon isnt in terribly good shape either,positive
if it werent so gorey it would almost be laughable,positive
but its a terrifically effective film and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked,positive
misery is a tight tense intense and chillingly entertaining thriller,positive
the directing is firstrate and the performances bates in particular contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem,positive
wonderful stuff,positive

im not quite sure what to say about mars attacks which is obviously the work of a deranged genius,positive
when tim burtons twisted alien invasion comedy really works its breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure,positive
and when it doesnt work its just dull,positive
im not even sure it works more often than it doesnt but where it counts that is when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come mars attacks,positive
is brilliant,positive
mars attacks,positive
is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summers independence day old alien invasion flicks disaster movies and bigbudget special effects extravaganzas,positive
but unlike independence day which was a painfully middleoftheroad appeal to the hearts minds and wallets of america mars attacks,positive
has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it,positive
the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings mars attacks,positive
portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are,positive
the title sequence is just splendid an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation,positive
the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfmans thundering theremindriven score is absolutely jawdropping,positive
its so overwhelming that i swear to you i had trouble breathing,positive
the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes,positive
we get a glimpse of the alien leader resplendent in a purplesequined cape when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world naturally the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming,positive
but mostly the first act is spent developing characters setting up mildly comic situations and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton,positive
its a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens because burtons just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars,positive
anyone who comes to mars attacks,positive
expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed with few exceptions these characters are dispatched as the film progresses,positive
jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr strangeloves buck turgidson glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white houses kennedy room a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a bighaired pointybreasted sexpot lisa marie the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood in an earlier scene its made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy,positive
sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j fox is her newsman husband,positive
the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles they blew up congress,positive
and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace,positive
jim brown and tom jones are the films vegasbased heroes and director barbet schroeder reversal of fortune has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president,positive
also on hand and underutilized are annette bening pierce brosnan pam grier lukas haas and natalie portman the latter two also show up in woody allens everyone says i love you,positive
the real stars of course are the computergenerated martians and theyre fantastic,positive
with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skullfaces round eggeyes with red pupils darting this way and that these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate joe dantes gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory but burtons little monsters are more inventive,positive
the films raison detre are the scenes of crimes against mankind the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault easter island is turned into a bowling alley and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans,positive
the sheer level of mayhem is staggering especially when the aliens make their first attack blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons,positive
parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg13 rating its earned,positive
the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day although mars attacks,positive
was in production long before that films release,positive
cinematographer peter suschitzky who makes the most of wynn thomass wildly imaginative production design thomas helped define the spike lee style actually took time off from his mars attacks,positive
regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg,positive
cronenbergs movie will almost certainly be more somber it wont be released in the u s until early next year but mars attacks,positive
is surely a similarly elegant nightmare,positive
this is not a nice movie,positive
and which studio executive was duped into giving burton 70 million to make it,positive
by setting the films final scenes in the nearly empty holocaustravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided burtons invasion epic suggests that the world weve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead,positive
the victims of his invasion are naive greedy or disastrously selfabsorbed and a good thing too since the movies wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wishfulfillment fantasy,positive
the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers who triumph by determining that the alien invaders the ultimate elitists are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture,positive
ultimately this messy masterpiece is the years funniest comedy and a weird winking affirmation of the power of the people,positive
it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters,positive
his new film the thin red line is a strange beautiful enigmatic mess of a movie,positive
the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast,positive
it is filled with abovethetitle stars,positive
the cast for the most part gives great performances,positive
john travolta whose role is nothing more than a cameo seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve,positive
george clooney whose role became a cameo in editing gives a strange performance,positive
one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a characters narration,positive
the rest of the cast especially nick nolte and elias koteas are unambiguously fantastic,positive
these actors and they are with two exceptions men were lured by the name of malick,positive
terrence malick is a cinematic legend,positive
he has often been called the j d salinger of cinema,positive
his two previous films badlands and days of heaven are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures,positive
after he made them he disappeared for 20 years,positive
this film marks his return,positive
what hes made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment,positive
the narration which fills the film and perplexes many not only lets us hear the narrators the characters themselves pontificate but also lets us hear such ofthemoment thoughts as im scared,positive
the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted,positive
the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill,positive
a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult because the story is fractured,positive
many stories are here from the clash between the lieutenant elias koteas and the savage colonel a voracious nick nolte to the private ben chaplin who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going,positive
the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault,positive
it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box shook the box and poured the results onto a table,positive
this basically creates a mess but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed,positive
im not declaring that the film has no structure,positive
while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat,positive
the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking,positive
the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice,positive
this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video,positive
ultimately malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them,positive
the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature,positive
while some have said that the antiwar message and pronature tubthumping was juvenile it was done with so much complexity and thought that it cannot ever honestly be called childish,positive
after seeing the thin red line i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again,positive
in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies payback was better than conspiracy theory but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon,positive
in other words its a decent couple of hours of entertainment but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibsons greatest hits payback probably wont be on it,positive
gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll,positive
mels partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt,positive
so he puts a couple of bullets in mel leaving him for dead and goes on to pay off his creditors,positive
but mel isnt dead it would be a real short movie if he was and he certainly isnt happy,positive
to make matters worse he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat,positive
his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters so mel goes after the mob to get it back,positive
payback is often a very violent film,positive
to its credit there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic but the director im not sure which one more about that in a second made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films,positive
the film appears a bit disjointed in places which is understandable considering producer star gibson wasnt thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it reshot,positive
when the director refused another one was brought in to do the reshoot,positive
so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end,positive
its always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain unless that person has some redeeming qualities,positive
in this case gibsons character has few redeeming qualities,positive
but hey its mel so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him,positive
my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role the audience would not be quite as responsive,positive
gibson is gibson whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer he does a good job,positive
he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance,positive
this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast including maria bello as his love interest william devane and kris kristofferson as mod bosses,positive
the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesnt have a real big part is james coburn as yet another mobster,positive
if i had one big disappointment in this film it would be that coburn didnt have a bigger role,positive
in the end payback is a fairly solid action thriller just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibsons other work,positive
a cinematic version of one of john irvings novels is always cause for celebration even if as in the case of simon birch the treatment is merely suggested by rather than strictly based on the book,positive
suggested means that irving author of the acclaimed the world according to garp sold the rights to his novel a prayer for owen meany to the disney machine for 1 million but wouldnt grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names,positive
thats an odd decisionirving claims its to protect both himself and the novelbut its one that doesnt unduly harm the finished product,positive
irvings books are rich and complex works full of intriguing colorful characters,positive
a prayer for owen meany is no exception it tells the story of an unusual boycalled simon birch in the film versionwho is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a highpitched falsetto voice like strangled mice,positive
simon believes himself to be gods instrument placed on this earth to somehow effect gods plan,positive
simon is played by ian michael smith who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which among other things prevents bones ligaments and joints from developing normally,positive
smiths debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for simon birch however the producers unwisely favored form over functionsmiths acting abilities are limited at best,positive
another drawback is that in the book simons condition is described the way irving describes any of his charactersin careful loving detail,positive
watching simon birch however creates a different feeling altogether the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character surely something irving would not have intended,positive
simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating a combination of smiths rookie status as an actor and the precocious oneliners hes forced to deliver courtesy mark steven johnson the films director and screenwriter,positive
fortunately simon birch isnt the real star of the film that bears his name,positive
simon is more of a catalyst allowing his costars to shape the story and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances saving the film from an obsequious manipulative destiny,positive
first and foremost is joseph mazzello jurassic park who is nothing less than remarkable as simons best friend joe,positive
mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old ripe with laughter pain and tears he is certainly an emerging talent,positive
ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca joes single mother and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend ben,positive
david strathairn and jan hooks play the towns reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others,positive
theres even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from,positive
well that would be telling,positive
perhaps suggested by the novel is the appropriate way to go after all since simon birch only focuses on one chapter one year of simons extraordinary life,positive
the film also changes the books ending to one that is more melodramatic yet necessary given simons lot,positive
the flavor of irvings original novel remains howeverthe passions friendships and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown maine and the engaging oddballs both big and small who reside there,positive
it has happened again,positive
a movie that is well scripted well acted and well directed,positive
it is involving suspenseful,positive
it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus,positive
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie,positive
the sixth sense is that movie,positive
starring bruce willis armageddon as a child psychologist and haley joel osment forrest gump as a troubled youngster the sixth sense is more spooky than scary though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle,positive
eightyearold cole sear osment sees dead people,positive
not just in dreams,positive
and not just as lifeless bodies,positive
he sees them walking around like regular people,positive
and he sees them all the time,positive
dr malcolm crowe willis is trying to help him,positive
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself,positive
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest,positive
but first he needs to gain coles trust,positive
the boy is so frightened by what he sees he has closed himself off emotionally being unwilling to tell anyone,positive
not crowe not even his own mother toni collette clockwatchers,positive
about his secrets,positive
crowe begins to spend more and more time with him even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him his wife anna olivia williams rushmore becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy,positive
bruce willis underplays his role allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development,positive
crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who wont communicate to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations to wondering if perhaps there isnt some truth behind what the boy sees,positive
mr willis does a serviceable job letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona,positive
elevenyearold haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance,positive
he demonstrates an amazing amount of selfcomposure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro,positive
it is fine work for one of such a tender age,positive
keep your eye on this young man,positive
the supporting cast is also quite effective,positive
toni collette as the confused frightened and frustrated mother who cant understand what is happening to her child olivia williams as crowes once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband and donnie wahlberg ransom as crowes expatient now grown who illustrates his doctors failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable,positive
twentyeight year old m night shyamalan wide awake directed his own script maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the films full impact is not reached until its final moments when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it,positive
it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr shyamalan as the one responsible is certainly to be commended,positive
in giving the sixth sense a favorable three star review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit i must also point out that spiritually speaking the film is highly misleading,positive
there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the living dead,positive
the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself,positive
the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve thou shall not surely die a direct contradiction of gods admonition,positive
that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages,positive
scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ,positive
an event which has not yet occurred,positive
therefore the dead remain in a state of oblivion having no consciousness until that longawaited time when the final trump shall sound,positive
and then youll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens,positive
bob the happy bastards quickie review,positive
the mummy,positive
brendan frasers stuck in the past again but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone,positive
fraser is the lead star of the mummy the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising,positive
its a rough adaptation of the 1932 film and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages like boris karloff was engulfed in,positive
but who cares the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you cant get from oh say godzilla or armageddon,positive
fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground,positive
basically its a little sign from the mummy buried underneath a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress,positive
his plan wake back up and wake her up also making him invincible,positive
of course fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian rachel weisz and her brother john hanna along with a former buddy of his deep risings kevin j oconnor and some americans and,positive
guess what,positive
yup ihmoetep arnold vosloo awakens and wreaks havoc,positive
fire flies from the sky flesheating beetles crawl about and well ihmoeteps plan begins to unfold,positive
ok so its not really all that new a story but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough,positive
the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch and the acting from fraser and weisz isnt half bad either,positive
the action is pretty intense favorite scene the sandstorm and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horrorloving folks as well,positive
no its no phantom menace beater but if youre looking for a solid warmup to the summer movie season you wont find a better film under wraps than the mummy,positive
if this doesnt give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man then nothing will,positive
after bloody clashes and independence won lumumba refused to pander to the belgians who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo,positive
their officers particularly general janssens rudi delhem in the force publique the congos army caused rebellions undermining lumumba who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals,positive
with unrest building moise tshombe pascal nzonzi and the province of katanga which contained 70 percent of the countrys resources proclaimed secession,positive
lumumba replaced janssens making mobutu a colonel and went on a pacification,positive
tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu maka kotto but it was too late,positive
when you want to drown a dog you say it has rabies prophesies lumumba of his own fate,positive
peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players although they frequently succumb to cliche particularly regarding lumumbas private life,positive
pecks script illuminates bantu sayings like the hand that gives rules when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador,positive
pecks direction is less assured with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare,positive
hes served well though by his casting of ebouaney in the title role,positive
ebouaney is dynamic radiating his characters fierce passion for his people and his country,positive
lumumbas intelligence and ability to strategize even as hes cornered by insurmountable odds are given life by ebouaney,positive
pecks subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production,positive
lumumba is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaneys performance makes the tragedy personally felt,positive
there seem to be two reactions to dark city,positive
you either love it or you are unimpressed,positive
count me as a love it,positive
as good as the crow and spawn are dark city is better,positive
where the former two have a specific comicbook following the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal,positive
it has a similar look to the others but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent,positive
not clever or complex the story is still fascinating like a selection from the twilight zone,positive
a man rufus sewell is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe,positive
surprised the attacker runs off,positive
the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a womans body in the room,positive
a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately so he packs some clothes and leaves never sure why hes leaving or what hes fleeing,positive
ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city hounding him like figures in a nightmare,positive
an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i d,positive
the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch,positive
now if only he could remember the rest of his life,positive
dark city is good on many levels,positive
first the look of the movie is excellent,positive
give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements,positive
there are visual elements from the american 1920s60s mixed with dickensera urban industrial elements,positive
it is all pulled together in a sad dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hoppers painting nighthawks,positive
proyas use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the films world for not only does the audience see the city a model but so do the ghouls,positive
the look is like a cross between tim burtons batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay,positive
second the editing of the film is good,positive
the pacing is on track and the plot is revealed the amnesia explained in satisfying increments,positive
also the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense caffeinated look,positive
third the special effects are well used,positive
they look good but more importantly the right effects are used for the right job,positive
one example stands out in my mind the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically,positive
a simple ripple effect is used,positive
a more showy effect could have been chosen but then it would have just been gratuitous,positive
restraint was shown where necessary letting the more critical effects look more impressive,positive
finally like gattaca dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance,positive
unlike gattaca the story is just openended and nonliteral enough to be successful,positive
john murdochs recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night and the hopeful coming of the dawn,positive
his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind at least in his world,positive
when we finally see the big picture of the movies world it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle,positive
a few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave but i do strongly recommend it for its look its pace its story and its timelessness,positive
it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system,positive
no major surprise when j s mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either,positive
the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority,positive
small wonder that hollywoods most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individualunderdog against some larger collective oppressive witness braveheart born on the fourth of july rocky first blood clear and present danger jfk the list goes on,positive
theres little of that in singapore we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line though the governments been long worried about the younger people getting americanised and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition,positive
the people vs larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america sex,positive
does pornography have a right to exist and circulate,positive
larry flynt the publisher of hustler magazine thinks so and obviously so too the u s congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net,positive
but even with such actions americans remain undecided,positive
the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire,positive
what they have ignored is actually a great picture,positive
woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a tohellwithmorality tohellwiththelaw and tohellwiththesystem antichrist that we last saw in natural born killers,positive
and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his exstripper wife dearly,positive
the latter is played with abandon conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination if not of the award itself,positive
edward norton plays their jerky lawyer,positive
the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox superficially they are immoral outcasts whove had it coming woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down and courtney dies of aids,positive
gods damnation,positive
but in the powerful love they have for each other each standing by the other in turn the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and in the american context a christian if they can love and care and feel just like anyone else on a personal level,positive
friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moralchristian influences,positive
to go beyond good and evil,positive
this is a great picture no doubt and i love it personally,positive
because it is moving funny ends with open american optimism blah blah,positive
but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases,positive
there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities,positive
this movie is not so much about larry flynt but about americans and american society,positive
theres a moment in schindlers list when a number of jews are trudging through snow clean and crisp dark edges and frost on the ground,positive
one girl waltzes through wearing a red dress that stings the eyes,positive
it is probably the finest moment through out the film,positive
when i first saw it i began to cry though i could not say why,positive
this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole,positive
when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground so black and murky its almost pomegranate red,positive
at another time we follow a young boy as he runs searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet which is already occupied,positive
like so citizen kane fargo the godfather the godfather part ii greed many of the greatest american films schindlers list plays with the concepts of money power and soul,positive
but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing,positive
starkly emotional and brutally powerful schindlers list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings,positive
the following that it has gained is not suprising this is probably thus far the best film of the decade,positive
steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks jaws the indiana jones films and e t,positive
but it wasnt until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be,positive
the product of his genuis is really something to see it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you,positive
throughout we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads,positive
we watch oskar schindler liam neeson grow from an arrogant self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment,positive
the film requires much work and can be a harrowing experience go expecting a quick entertainment and youll be bitterly dissapointed,positive
it does reward the patient viewer,positive
this is a mature spielberg and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece,positive
this eqsuisite beautiful film is a rare gem,positive
it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies,positive
it leaves one breathless uplifted and with much to think about,positive
afterwards you can reflect on individual images visions and people,positive
laconic removed schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all does much and leaves feeling as if he could should have done more then he did and was able to,positive
the change seems natural in the hands of a lesser filmmaker it would be crude and would cheat the audience,positive
instead we are told a tale told a story,positive
the film is punishing to watch yes,positive
but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle and a genuine masterpiece of a movie,positive
the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ which explains why the bards materials are such a popular source for remakes revisions rewrites inspiration subtlety credit and dispute,positive
indeed in recent years american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products,positive
including this years upcoming a midsummer nights dream shakespeares material has been the cause for twentysix big screen productions since 1990,positive
but for a change of pace mrs,positive
brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love,positive
marc norman and tom stoppards story is largely fantasy although as the viewer soon learns shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously,positive
will shakespeare of the 1590s wouldve been married to anne hathaway and he wouldve had a teenage daughter and two young sons here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play and his current comedy in the works romeo and ethel the pirates daughter just doesnt quite seem right,positive
with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe rupert everett and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies romeo and juliet,positive
the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet to great effect,positive
fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy,positive
the supporting roles are well filled out from geoffrey rush as wills worrisome agent philip to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman,positive
even ben affleck leading the troupe of actors manages to make a favorable impression and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i gwyneth paltrow is by far however the standout of the lot creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance,positive
the story is wellcrafted if nothing else although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the lets make a movie genre,positive
the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted and certainly accessible by the audiences lowest common denominator,positive
theres something for everyone in this romantic comedy making it prime date flick material,positive
although certainly not inspiring in any regard it revels in a wholesome wellrounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998s pictures the truelove story is one of the best around,positive
certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent yearsopen releases is just around the corner,positive
after the average mouse hunt the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz dreamworks try again with the childrens film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story,positive
as the film warns us at the beginning its not the full story and some liberties have been taken but generally this the bible story we all know and love featuring burning bushes the plagues and the parting of the red sea,positive
the only thing missing is charlton heston,positive
instead we get val kilmer voicing moses an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt helen mirren,positive
we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses fiennes all grown up,positive
moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron sandra bullock and jeff goldblum that he isnt really the son of the pharaoh seti patrick stewart and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule,positive
he soon sets about this along with his wife tzipporah michelle pfeiffer,positive
rameses and his two wizard friends voiced by steve martin and martin short try to stop moses completing his task,positive
while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults for children reared on aladdin and hercules this film could be the most godawful thing theyve ever seen,positive
gone is the quick fire humour and standard easy to follow plot,positive
but spectacularly and to dreamworks credit nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen,positive
jeffrey katzenberg who produced this film certainly knows how to keep a child interested,positive
hes included some songs in the film plus some comedy and a exciting chariot chase to keep the children interested,positive
and somehow himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across without ever being boring,positive
its a remarkable achievement,positive
also remarkable is the animation which puts hercules an almost slap dash effort to shame,positive
relying on hand drawn and computer animation the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed,positive
the film seems a little caught up with its amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and moving shots but they do look incredible,positive
the final plague where god kills every first born child and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed,positive
kudos to the animators,positive
the vocal talent is also very good,positive
val kilmer does a fine job as moses although he doesnt sing and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses and he does sing,positive
sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great and steve martin and martin short are very good but not in the film long enough,positive
finally michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife,positive
kudos also goes to the voice of god who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued,positive
sadly he is uncredited and i couldnt quite work out who the voice was,positive
but email if you do,positive
the songs are good ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number,positive
they dont disturb the movie and while not particularly memorable they are nice to listen to theyre well sung aswell,positive
the musical score is suitably epic with some beautiful tunes,positive
coupled with the superb visuals the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat backed up with a great story,positive
entertaining both for kids and adults this film is a must see,positive
a david wilcock review 1998,positive
you know for kids norville barnes,positive
there was a lot riding on this movie,positive
everyone even moderately interested in the scream series was dying to know how it would end,positive
what would be the final act,positive
this is the end of an era for them a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies and for kids under 17 those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into scream while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves,positive
no need to worry scream 3 is endlessly inventive and entertaining a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name reinvented the horror genre and continued in the selfreferential postmodern tradition of quentin and co,positive
so how does the story go,positive
as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe sidney prescott neve campbell now allgrownup and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress but rather in upstate california living understandably alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems,positive
she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone,positive
but that s not where the movie starts off,positive
instead in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar and conceptually horrifying sequence in eye for an eye 1995 cotton weary liev schreiber now a big star drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls demands the location of sidney s home and when he doesn t get it threatens the life of cotton s girlfriend christine and cotton can t do anything to stop him,positive
the rest of the sequence is particularly clever setting up a constant throughout the picture the killer has a hightech electronic voicechanger that tops that of the first two,positive
not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voiceover artist roger jackson ha ha he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters including sidney and the returned gale weathers courtney cox arquette and dewey riley david arquette,positive
at the same time stab 3 the third filmwithinafilm based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro whereas the account of the first two films was true the franchise within scream has now become totally fictional,positive
nevertheless we learn cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production as himself to be killed off in the first scene,positive
so it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie either the actor portraying them or the real thing,positive
sometimes both,positive
clever indeed,positive
but who goes next,positive
no one knows,positive
three different scripts were penned we re told to keep the true finale off the internet a nod to the scream 2 fiasco a few years back and no one knows for sure which one the killer read,positive
still all the while sidney stays concealed in her home only visiting dad for the first halfhour of the film while also having horrifying visions of her mother which takes us back a bit to sidney s fear of becoming what her mother was or at least what her mother was secretly,positive
when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent she s chased onto the set of stab 3 wandering through woodsboro written and directed as an odd surreal nightmare indeed this is one of scream 3 s finest moments,positive
okay over the years i ll admit that i ve become quite the scream fan,positive
no i don t have the ghostface costume or the director s cut laserdisc but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films yes i said dramatic element sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with scream,positive
throughout the film though i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films,positive
granted that there s stabbinaplenty going on throughout but there s considerably less blood less gore,positive
honestly i like this approach,positive
it s more classical more rebellious constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven,positive
he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience,positive
some critics have noted that scream 3 seems to take itself more seriously this time maybe so or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger arlington road who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts saw an opportunity for true irony maybe even a little bit of satire if the film worked in a few more clich s,positive
what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film i m afraid is the ending or rather the identity of the killer,positive
it does the job i guess accomplishes what it should bringing the three films full circle but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived too arbitrary after a second viewing which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation the killer s identity still seems a little too random but his motivation came across more sound this time around and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying,positive
all in all scream 3 does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy it is not the worst of the films,positive
as a trilogy scream was a lot of fun refreshing humorous offbeat,positive
almost sad to see it go,positive
but then it does seem best to quit while you re ahead and scream 3 does a fine job of providing closure to its characters,positive
for now scream holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid,positive
not too shabby,positive
plot during a 10week span in london in the fall of 1888 jack the ripper a man whose identity was never uncovered committed five ritualistic grisly murders of prostitutes,positive
this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the centuryold mystery,positive
critique awesome,positive
i love dark movies i love stylish movies i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp so,positive
yes i really dug this movie,positive
the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously and this movie my friends is,positive
very serious,positive
in fact its also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell,positive
it aint for the kids ill tell you that much,positive
and if any of those recent hack directors of twobit screamesque slasher flicks want some advice on effective kill scenes do not look any further because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner especially when compared to their generic sliceanddice contrivances,positive
in fact most of this films structure is very creative the actors all solid the atmosphere and feel of the picture remarkably real gotta love those unfortunates and the descent into darkness well honed by the filmmakers,positive
you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time,positive
but its also an impressive mystery film based on the truelife tale of jack the ripper a man whose identity was never discovered,positive
the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel from hell written by alan moore and presents a compelling story which despite being a little oliver stoneish did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem sexual depravity drug usage insanity murders and love,positive
yes the brothers even managed to slip a little love story in here and despite not truly being developed i guess it couldve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already,positive
thats right theres no real need to put any romance in a film about a mass murderer,positive
but that aside you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities to center this movie all the way through,positive
sure hes just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one,positive
i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie but she was fine and how little the of depps character had to do with the films development from what i had seen in the trailer i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story but thankfully it wasnt,positive
on the downside the film doesnt really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development,positive
but then again a story about the most mysterious serial killer of alltime is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement,positive
i mean the less i knew about each person the more suspicious i became of each ones motives reasons etc,positive
in fact i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end and that was in part due to the distance to which id been held from the films characters or,positive
am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention,positive
perhaps,positive
overall this is an extremely creepy production with glorious cinematography reminiscent of coppolas dracula and burtons sleepy hollow a grim score and solid acting,positive
but its not for everyone,positive
some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events and even though the murders arent shown as graphically as you might think theres enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors,positive
but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable gothic atmosphere and this flick is just that and plenty more,positive
and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the rippers haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon brrrrr,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
the crow 910 dark city 910 dracula 710 jfk 910 the nightmare before christmas 1010 the ninth gate 810 the others 910 quills 810 shadow of the vampire 610 sleepy hollow 810,positive
for the first reel of girls town you just cant get over lili taylor,positive
is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student,positive
harder still can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part,positive
with the sure showy expertise of a de niro taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuckyou confidence she can muster,positive
its a deeply felt deadon performance and by the halfway point youve forgiven taylor her own maturity,positive
for all its verite pretenses girls town is less about a bunch of highschoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writerperformers examining their own feelings about rape relationships and american womanhood,positive
the movies opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four high school outsiders on the verge of graduation patti angela bruklin harris emma anna grace and nikki aunjanue ellis,positive
but about 10 minutes into the film we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life,positive
the remaining girls manage to smug nikkis diary out of her grieving mothers home and page through it at pattis place investigating the root of nikkis despair,positive
what they find is cruel and galvanizing nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen,positive
shellshocked by the truth of the matter the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives,positive
emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player,positive
pattis barely sympathetic wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jocks car,positive
and anyway pattis had her own share of guys who wouldnt take no for an answer,positive
pained acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry angry about the impossibility of saying no and angry with themselves for being weak for being naive for putting up with it,positive
why do we put up with it,positive
emma finally asks once the argument has reached a fever pitch,positive
we try to talk about it and look what happens,positive
we fight for 20 minutes,positive
theres the admirable crux of this picture,positive
girls town is a political film in that it calls for action,positive
but its incompleteits never quite sure how to justify that action or what form it should take,positive
the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity and its surely one of this years most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passengerside window of that damn jocks car doing the right thing,positive
they hang out in the bathroom chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall,positive
subvert the patriarchy emma writes and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to,positive
the girls silence their hecklers take revenge on the deadbeat father of pattis child and eventually come facetoface with nikkis tormentor,positive
still the movie has a desperately unfinished quality and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying,positive
you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls but nobody thinks of it,positive
perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah who you callin a bitch,positive
the points are well taken but they should have been unnecessary,positive
long on characterization but a little short on story girls town is less than it could have been and too selfcongratulatory for my own taste,positive
director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r e m s,positive
michael stipe he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking,positive
the movie was created and scripted by committee but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when predictably the group couldnt secure funding,positive
then again girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film,positive
the movies slapdash quality is key to its significance,positive
truth be told all three of the leads look too wise for high school but thats ok theres a onceremoved quality to their fine spontaneous performances as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were the girls they wish they had been or some combination,positive
for all its flaws this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place,positive
run lola run a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance,positive
for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of nonstop movement we follow a fieryhaired heroine named lola franka potente as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers,positive
lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 000 marks in time to save manni moritz bleibtreu from being killed by the dealer,positive
but in something of a pseudo groundhog day approach director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal,positive
in these trio of episodes we gradually learn the unique effects of fate for even if tiny changes are made in lolas journey the future can be seriously altered,positive
run lola run is an experience like fight club or the matrix in that each film takes you through a supercharged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways,positive
in addition all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack,positive
lola is no exception with stylish quickflash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the getgo,positive
tykwers world is a landscape of mood and color with brilliant shades of red and pink including lolas fiery hair used as effective symbolism throughout,positive
with its visual style and mindblowing pace run lola run is one of the more invigorating movies of the year,positive
even more so when considering the fact its all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81minute time period,positive
as a heroine potente does little more than run wildly through the streets as the title suggests but she has a certain flair and charisma,positive
her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star,positive
meanwhile bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life,positive
both actors perform beyond the call of duty,positive
the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola and the outcome is ultimately rewarding several twists and turns are unique and unexpected,positive
the other characters lola runs into both purposely and inadvertently include her banker father herbert kraup and a friendly security guard armin rohde but aside from the two leads no one has more than a few minutes of screen time,positive
additional stars that couldnt possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy who are both responsible for the films eyecatching visual elegance,positive
run lola run is subtitled so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightningfast dialogue occasional sections of it are especially fast,positive
this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching,positive
the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation,positive
most are just chess pieces in tykwers elaborate game of visual presentation and he never really makes a significant move with any,positive
but the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay,positive
a few petty gripes aside this film is a wild exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality,positive
most people believe foreign films are mainly boring talky character studies,positive
perhaps run lola run will recharge their batteries,positive
not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny it also delivers a whiteknuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity,positive
like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character run lola run is exhausting,positive
if you want some hearty laughs then rat race is the movie for you,positive
this unpretentious little comedy which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype will have you bouncing in your theater seat,positive
and while the film fits neatly into the lowbrow slapstick school of comedy one refreshing aspect is its lack of meanspiritedness,positive
the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner john cleese who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city n m,positive
inside the locker is a duffel bag containing 2 million,positive
the first one to open the locker gets the bag and the money,positive
what the group of participants doesnt know is that cleeses donald sinclair i can do anything i want im eccentric is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel,positive
the participants include vera whoopi goldberg and merrill lanai chapman a newly reunited mother and daughter disgraced pro football referee owen templeton cuba gooding jr italian tourist mr pollini rowan atkinson randy pear jon lovitz and his family the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody seth green and vince vieluf and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer breckin meyer,positive
various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city,positive
screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another,positive
the most sidesplitting situations involve vera and merrills encounter with the squirrel lady a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates owens commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball lookalikes on their way to a lucy convention the cody brothers misadventures with a hotair balloon a flying cow and a monster truck and the pear familys stopover at a barbie museum which turns out not to be what they think it is,positive
the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckmans script builds the laughs,positive
without going into detail this bit segues from the museum to hitlers touring car to eva brauns dark lipstick to lovitz burning his tongue culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans,positive
rat races cast is first rate,positive
cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap lovitz is at first a bit whiny but his character grows on you gooding is having a fine romp and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleeses deadpan assistant a man born without a personality,positive
the film is directed by jerry zucker who knows something about comedy,positive
along with his brother david and friend jim abrahams he was responsible for such hits as airplane,positive
and ruthless people,positive
a throwaway subplot which is good for some laughs features cleese and his buddies betting on a series of outlandish situations including one dealing with a hooker and peptobismol,positive
this is a fun little feature,positive
the only letdown comes at the finale which is too touchyfeely and sweet almost negating what came before it,positive
rat race is a summer sleeper but it will keep you awake as will the laughter of those watching around you,positive
driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small intimate story,positive
its a quiet film a slow film a deliberate film,positive
but if youre patient with it the movie offers innumerable rewards such as a pair of selfassured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy,positive
driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhrys pulitzerprize winning play of the same name which first opened in new york four years ago,positive
the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union,positive
uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza,positive
the film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years a cranky 70something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60something black man who becomes her chauffeur,positive
the movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action,positive
in fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesnt present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together,positive
rather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on,positive
the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlantas history including the 1958 bombing of the temple the citys oldest jewish congregation and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr,positive
the story begins in 1948 with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway,positive
the insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her a chauffeur,positive
freeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke,positive
the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger,positive
driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature aging prejudice and a great many other things but more than anything its about a relationship one that spans 25 years 4 cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon,positive
daisy is strongwilled and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur,positive
initially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere,positive
once she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate backseat driver,positive
to make matters worse she is extremely selfconscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand,positive
eventually however daisy is worn down by hokes goodnatured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him,positive
tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace,positive
weve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon,positive
nevertheless tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own,positive
freeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances,positive
there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color,positive
hoke is uneducated and illiterate but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior,positive
both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element in full command of their natural charisma,positive
they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves,positive
they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movies gentle humor,positive
at the same time tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama,positive
in his first dramatic role dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie tandys loving and patient son,positive
drama seems to agree with aykroyd taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ghostbusters ii the great outdoors my stepmother is an alien,positive
the only other significant characters in the film are daisys housekeeper idella marvelously played by esther rolle good times and boolies pretentious wife played by patti lupone,positive
under the direction of bruce beresford crimes of the heart tender mercies driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again,positive
but fortunately beresford never forgets hes shooting a movie and accordingly he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches such as gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes,positive
in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety,positive
uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say,positive
beresford wisely exercises restraint in the films dramatic moments,positive
the movie tugs at your heart but it never goes for the jugular,positive
the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees,positive
copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives,positive
sid james plays henry who no sooner has the film started is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon,positive
as part of his alliance with france he requests the handinmarriage to the queen of normandy joan sims,positive
she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath he is totally averse to the idea of marriage,positive
henrys court is very corrupt with the cardinal terry scott trying to bribe cromwell kenneth williams and cromwell trying to bribe the king,positive
there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen sims in the tower of london ready for execution,positive
the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey who has a rather lecherous character to play this time,positive
the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices,positive
owing to circumstances sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isnt,positive
this is because of renewed threats by the king of france peter gilmore to come over himself which in the end he does,positive
by then henry has found himself a new queen played by none other than barbara windsor,positive
it looks like he has some explaining to do,positive
there are standout performances by sid james as henry joan sims as marie and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal,positive
also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth who plays barbaras father,positive
the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good,positive
there is even an early appearance from david prowse who later became the green cross code man and darth vader,positive
the film does have its downsides though as it is getting pretty routine for the carryon team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly,positive
there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw who could have helped the film along,positive
however overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyones while to sit down and watch it,positive
meet joe black is your classic boymeetsgirl boylikesgirl boygetskilledinhorribleaccident supernaturalentitytakesoverboysbody supernaturalentityfallsinlovewithgirl story,positive
based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love,positive
william parrish anthony hopkins is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday,positive
he has built a huge media empire and raised two beautiful daughters allison marcia gay harden and susan claire forlani,positive
william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality the one situation he wont be able to talk his way out of,positive
and he has good reason to fear for death himself is stalking him,positive
however death has a deal to make,positive
death has taken possession of a man who has recently died brad pitt and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living,positive
in return william gets to live a few extra days,positive
of course he agrees,positive
death under the human name of joe black gets to experience life as a complete innocent,positive
he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter,positive
and hes not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love,positive
but is their affair doomed to an early demise,positive
at nearly three hours in length meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side though it never gets boringly lengthy,positive
instead the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations,positive
you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere rather than being hurriedly rushed through it,positive
the romantic angle works well though surprisingly the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter,positive
this is most likely due to anthony hopkins who once again displays his superb acting skills,positive
william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life and doesnt want to let it go,positive
by contrast claire forlani is merely the romantic interest,positive
she gets to show joe the ropes of love but is hardly as interesting a character,positive
as joe black brad pitt seems a bit stilted,positive
granted hes supposed to be outofplace but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role,positive
still he is able to hold his own and over the course of the three hours his character begins to grow on you,positive
the main character who seems out of place here is drew jake weber an ambitious executive in williams company who is joe blacks main rival for susans affections,positive
weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash,positive
this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters,positive
the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily but never distractingly so,positive
we never learn what is the exact nature of death or why hes never done something like this before,positive
it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own,positive
his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter,positive
and the ultimate resolution to one of the films supernatural problems seems well somewhat superficial,positive
still even with the films length it was a pleasant time at the movies something you wouldnt necessarily expect from a film about death but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow,positive
with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately what with that whole clinton thing going on you know 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern oh please government waste my taxes just a bit more would you,positive
its about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement,positive
with this and crimson tide hes created two successfully chilly films that are interesting exciting even pretty smart but never totally riveting as cinema and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart,positive
that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them and was appropriately scary and all but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant,positive
enemy of the state is the same way its engrossing for its entire running time and its scary the way that it shows a mans decent into kafkaism but its too technical,positive
its too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be,positive
it casts will smith one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because hes charming and witty and never uninteresting and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person,positive
i hate to do this but last years film the game got it damn perfect it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened,positive
the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling but also the best mindfuck of the entire year,positive
not that i want every kafkaesque film to be the game this years the spanish prisoner succeeds with less thrills and chills but it should be an example of what works and what doesnt,positive
will smiths character is frankly too perfect at least too movie perfect,positive
he had an affair with another woman lisa bonet ha ha but his relationship with his wife regina king is basically fine regardless,positive
he has a kid and hes raking in money as a lawyer albeit a very good and reasonably moral one,positive
so he generally doesnt have any real problems as a human being and is therefore boring except that he is played by will smith who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering id4 men in black territory,positive
hes a good dramatic actor just see the first half hour of six degrees of separation for proof of this not that he isnt great the whole time and here he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities,positive
smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party a nature observer played by uh jason lee,positive
the government wants the disk and is prepared to destroy his life to get it,positive
as smiths plight is dramatized we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him sitting in vans disguised as other businesses staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet,positive
these guys played by jack black jamie kennedy and seth green are the most interesting part of this film because theyre well fascinating theyre doing their jobs which are evil but the film doesnt view them as such and they almost become our friends,positive
we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesnt automatically judge them as the villains,positive
theyre also scary because we get the idea that theyre not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world,positive
its as if theyre obsessed with their jobs not because theyre evil but because hey its a fun job and no one else can do it like them,positive
unfortunately this also backfires a bit on the film instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that the game was you see everything and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on,positive
sure youre chilled but youre not exacty freaked out by whats going on,positive
but what do you expect from tony scott the man who never met a fivesecond piece of film he ever liked,positive
hes a notbad director because hell he is always interesting to watch if not occasionally moronic exhibit a days of thunder but the reason hes not great is because hes too technical and calculated,positive
his shots are perfectly executed and leave nothing to the imagination and theyre always making sure youre paying attention,positive
this is incredibly annoying and it reduces enemy of the state to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths but still manage to entertain without any real problems,positive
despite never actually becoming great its never actually boring and its always intriguing,positive
watching the government setup smith is endlessly fascinating and since we care about smiths likeable protagonist we are setup for a good two hours worth of tom clancyesque entertainment,positive
add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos and youve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smiths plight without a minutes worth of boredom,positive
of the major horror subgenres vampire movies are easily the most adaptable,positive
think about it,positive
frankenstein movies havent changed all that much because they still need that madscientistinbavariancastle setting,positive
if you made a frankenstein movie today youd have to have the monster be a virus or something and outside of michael j fox there arent any actors that could play a virus convincingly,positive
movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt,positive
theres not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something,positive
and theres that michael j fox thing again,positive
but you can have vampires do anything and you can place them in any genre you want just about,positive
you can have traditional vampire movies bram stokers dracula or have the anne rice version interview with the vampire or play it for laughs vampire in brooklyn,positive
you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california the lost boys to squalid mexican dives from dusk till dawn to your local high school buffy the vampire slayer,positive
were it not redundant you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires,positive
any day now i expect well see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record,positive
or you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie and when you do that you get blade,positive
wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie the silent expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path,positive
in this case the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead bleeding corpses,positive
snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u s marshals but does a demonstrably better job here as a halfvampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers,positive
blade is a silent brooding presence laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse,positive
he is as cold as his silverbladed sword as single minded as his garlicfilled bullets,positive
yet hes not without quirks blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent,positive
like any good hong kong movie blade is heavy on the chopsocky action,positive
for some reason blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional antivampire weapons of garlic and silver,positive
blade dismisses a manportable arc lamp as being too heavy although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires,positive
unfortunately the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers which it most strongly resembles,positive
the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didnt review mostly because it made no impression on me and i couldnt remember anything other than noise violence and the intensity of fats performance,positive
blade has a little more going for it and has the vampire myth to draw from but other than that its the same kind of movie exciting with well choreographed action scenes but with no resonance,positive
with a stronger villain stephen dorff is pardon the pun curiously bloodless as the head vampire leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role a wittier script and a strong supporting cast blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment,positive
as it is blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying,positive
with the abundance of trite recycled movies in the late 90s there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers never mind movie critics for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original perhaps audaciously perhaps purely thematically,positive
for the former you need look no further than director tom tykwers incredible german thriller run lola run a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards,positive
lola a contemporary gothgirl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day,positive
it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks and if he doesnt deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes he will be killed,positive
this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 000 marks or her boyfriend dies,positive
so she runs not just jogs sprints in hopes that somehow someway shell be able to obtain the money and save a life,positive
from there as critic steve rhodes described it run lola run plays a bit like sliding doors on steroids,positive
with a nonstop techno soundtrack wierd camerawork all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something,positive
indeed the movie is often outrageously exciting as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious,positive
very much like titanic run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film,positive
the way the movie is made for pure visual style tykwers movie is breathtaking literally sometimes,positive
thematically it does leave something to be desired it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash,positive
while you are watching this will not matter,positive
running a breezy 81 minutes this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted,positive
it is the equivalent of a rollercoaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers,positive
1999 eugene novikov137,positive
renown surrealist director the 77yearold frenchman alain resnais hiroshima mon year at lo has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven 1978 tv serial 1981 movie and the singing detective 1986,positive
the film follows potters gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lipsynched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts,positive
he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct such as the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort,positive
the tale has resnaiss unique touches as a director to go along with his homage,positive
it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person and that there is a song in everyones heart for every occasion,positive
what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers and the farce seems more banal than daring,positive
yet it is not without its striking moments and charms such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs,positive
also the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else which has always been embellished in movie lore comes through with flying colors,positive
it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there,positive
it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness,positive
they are the attractive sisters odile sabine az ma and camille agnes jaoui with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts,positive
she is married to the glum and laconic claude pierre arditi,positive
she once went out with a businessman nicolas jeanpierre bacri who left her 8years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family,positive
simon andre dussolier works as a realestate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat in his spare time he writes radio plays,positive
simons boss is the much younger unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier lambert wilson who inherited the firm from his father and is the realestate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view,positive
screenwriters and actors jeanpierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts,positive
jaouis camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph d,positive
in history using for her thesis the study of the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru,positive
she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks even though she appears to have outwardly perfect selfcontrol,positive
on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her but not having the nerve to tell her this,positive
to his dismay he finds out she is dating his meanspirited but handsome boss whom she meets when looking at her sisters new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold not because hes so sensitive,positive
bacri as the classy nicolas turns out to be now working as a chauffeur,positive
he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him,positive
odile still pines for him but hes married telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly,positive
love is the same old song that makes the world go round even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are,positive
everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odiles place as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be,positive
theres not a lot of bite to this satirical musical but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors if not the best,positive
this film is not one his great ones but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting,positive
it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice,positive
it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters behavior as being similar in business as in love,positive
magnolia left me relling from the theatre staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft,positive
at nearly three and a half hours magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film,positive
it not only demands your attention but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions,positive
it is delirious depressing heady pretentious surreal filmmaking,positive
its also a movie that will polarize its viewers,positive
director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesnt let up until an oddly exhilerating biblically influenced pseudoclimax,positive
the characters make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives,positive
there is frank mackey tom cruise a slithery snake charmer of men whose search and destroy seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants,positive
there is earl partridge jason robards a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son,positive
there is game show host jimmy gator phillip baker hall a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public,positive
and there is police officer jim kurring john c reilly who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process,positive
given equal weight are stories involving a cokeaddled emotional cripple melora walters a former tv quiz show champion william h macy,positive
a materialistic adulterous wife julianne moore a child jeremy blackman victimized by a mentally abusive parent and a caring empathetic nurse philip seymour hoffman,positive
hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death lies and despair,positive
it is not a pleasant movie,positive
there is not one bad note in the acting,positive
it is affecting and layered and wonderful,positive
there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films,positive
then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene,positive
walters plays her character with redeyed rawness and a fierce selfdestructiveness that is anxiety inducing,positive
robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man who still hears a lions roar when he speaks,positive
director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote,positive
the problem is that he stays on them too long,positive
julianne moores character linda quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt tears screaming and remorse and never backs off from it,positive
after a few hours it turns from interesting to chinese water torture,positive
quite a few scenes such as the game show go on just a bit too long and will be offputting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around,positive
and just what is the theme,positive
alienation,positive
hopelessness,positive
anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesnt make it easy,positive
the film starts by showing three strange and seemingly unrelated events,positive
its a harbinger of the synchronicity to come,positive
at times different stories reach reach key moments at the same time,positive
other times stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory regardless of what else is happening,positive
anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film,positive
whats surprising is that it mostly works,positive
if you have doubts about andersons intentions ill ask you to pay attention to the final frame,positive
despite all the sturm und drang magnolia ultimately speaks to mans capacity for hope and attempts at redemption,positive
despite magnolias needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur showing off fro the masses i have to admire his guts,positive
this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling,positive
my rating a bulleye,positive
stars,positive
a side note helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann,positive
her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful,positive
when she sings save me at the end it enhances the yearning felt by the characters just as wise up mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives,positive
larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the of the multimillion dollar hustler publications company,positive
the people vs larry flynt is the story of larry flynts fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine hustler,positive
based on a true story the film is almost a documentary in that its a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynts life,positive
woody harrelson gives an excellent performance,positive
he conveys flynts peculiarities and his character with depth and focus,positive
by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves somewhat grudgingly liking larry flynt,positive
this is some feat given flynts apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court,positive
however flynt has a number of things going for him hes rich hes funny and most importantly he says exactly what he means,positive
larry flynts wife althea leasure is played by courtney love,positive
larry meets althea at one of his clubs and they fall in love a very sexual and open love,positive
both of them indulge in a world of too much sex and eventually too much drugs,positive
flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down which was especially upsetting for him by an assassin,positive
althea had joined him in taking the drugs,positive
following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs althea does not have any such plans nor the determination to follow them,positive
as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick,positive
courtney love obviously has a great understanding for altheas situation as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect,positive
its extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away,positive
edward norton plays flynts lawyer alan isaacman,positive
again this is a solid performance,positive
the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynts courtroom antics,positive
flynt is not only childish in the courtroom but downright rude to the judges and lands himself in a lot of trouble and even in a mental institution because of it,positive
isaacman is very easy to like and great at proving in quite clever ways his points to the court,positive
milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs larry flynt,positive
it is not really an exciting or thrilling film but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story,positive
due to larrys character it is also at times a very funny film,positive
however it is much more than that,positive
it is about the fight for freedom of speech anticensorship and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy,positive
an excellent look at flynt his life and his story,positive
keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey,positive
devotees of robert a heinlein be forewarned paul verhoevens starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinleins novel than it is a literary satire,positive
the authors jingoalltheway militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless faceless parade of carnage from the film version,positive
and i suppose thats exactly what verhoeven delivers with sometimes hilarious results,positive
heinleins basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement while their strengths become the stuff of highenergy entertainment,positive
outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor since its basically a big bug hunt aliens in broad daylight,positive
sometime in the future humanity is threatened by giant malevolent insects which have evolved into twentyfoottall action figures arachnids with superimpaling spikes beetles that spew forth lava dragonflies with guillotine legs,positive
among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires conflicted rich kid johnny rico casper van dien his math whiz girlfriend carmen denise richards dizzy dina meyer who secretly carries a torch for johnny and carl neil patrick doogie howser harris who notsosecretly carries a torch for dizzy and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets,positive
while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry their various battles intertwining with romantic subplots out of a third season episode from beverly hills 90210,positive
so if starship troopers is another movie where onedimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens what makes it any better than say independence day a movie where onedimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens,positive
for one thing you sense that the filmmakers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material,positive
the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate not just fiscally prudent,positive
if starship troopers had been turned into a tvmovie aaron spelling would have produced it,positive
its a story which requires emoting not acting its a prime time soap opera with big guns played for all the dopey melodrama its worth,positive
the noname cast also plays into verhoevens treatment of heinleins most controversial conceit,positive
in this society we learn one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service military for most,positive
verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads named after the world war iiera why we fight series in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches,positive
these characters really are just fresh meat for the grinder as one character puts it which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting,positive
its not that starship troopers is antimilitary because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big violent video game,positive
in fact the characters are living the propaganda particularly johnny who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends,positive
verhoeven is actually having it both ways hes making fun of gungho boosterism even as he fires his freshfaced recruits into battle on a gungho booster rocket of visual effects,positive
if that makes starship troopers hypocritical at least its enthusiastically staged hypocrisy,positive
there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film but it moves like nobodys business,positive
verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping,positive
it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasnt perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings,positive
i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers but it didnt work out that way,positive
that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material,positive
notice this is a review and analysis of exotica,positive
the first part of this piece is the review the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers,positive
if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so then save the second part for the discussion afterwards,positive
starring bruce greenwood mia kirshner elias kosteas don mckellar arsinee khanijian sarah polley director atom egoyan screenplay atom egoyan,positive
exotica is a film that grows on retrospection,positive
exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film,positive
all of the people know each other but apart from that there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account,positive
the director hints for possible solutions using a multiline plot so popular with critics in mystery train and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction,positive
exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique,positive
at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features,positive
the outofchronologicalorder technique has become ever so popular perhaps even de rigueur for biographical films,positive
similarly we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use to varying extent converging multiplots,positive
on a first glance once the multiplot puzzle in exotica is solved there seems to be little left to look at,positive
but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather commentaries on views of life,positive
exotica is very much worth seeing,positive
it opened to critics praise worldwide i first saw it in mexico city last december,positive
in canada it broke records for a movie of its kind which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release,positive
apart from a strong plot acting is very convincing and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie,positive
the spoonfedentertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie and thus it might last little on screen,positive
but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd with an originality that is ever so rare by all means see exotica,positive
analysis spoilers ahead,positive
what is behind the complex plot in exotica,positive
first a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means,positive
the lone taxauditor the repressed homosexual pet shop owner the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub the rich man which has the club remodeled the audience at the movie theatre all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul,positive
then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people including those who sit watching exotica,positive
in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub for the rich man looking through silver mirrors and poorrich people looking at others people lives through a silver screen,positive
exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner,positive
exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person no attraction to the strip dancer and only interested on avoiding jail no personal relationship with the tax auditor,positive
in exotica everybody is watching and what is worse everybody knows,positive
second exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters,positive
the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter,positive
the niece becomes the baby sitter the baby sitter becomes the dancer and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter,positive
the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj by finding the proverbial daughter,positive
a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie,positive
steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits like jurassic park and oscar awarded critical triumphs like schindlers list,positive
however in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories,positive
one of them is close encounters of the third kind extremely popular and influential sciencefiction spectacle,positive
unfortunately it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars,positive
although both films have a lot in common groundbreaking special effects brilliant score by john williams their future was different one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow,positive
when spielberg began work on that project he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit jaws,positive
together with other young directors of his new hollywood generation like kauffman carpenter hill and millius he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment,positive
ironically it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of blockubuster philosophy,positive
but in the mid 1970s many things were different spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie,positive
although very personal spielbergs screenplay was partly based on the book ufo experience by dr j allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2,positive
spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost unmatched until the contemporary era of xfiles and the roswell anniversary,positive
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic uforelated incidents as the element of the plot,positive
the story begins with one of such incidents team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u s navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19,positive
such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary richard dreyfuss power company worker from muncie indiana who later becomes obsessed with his experience,positive
because of his obsession he loses his job family and sanity but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler melinda dillon single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction,positive
in the meantime the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u s government in cooperation with the french led by lacombe francois truffaut begin with the preparation for ultrasecret project,positive
when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area,positive
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions,positive
two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there,positive
spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects,positive
the slow gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents close encounters is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale,positive
but instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder,positive
throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big magnificent and wonderful is about to happen and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end,positive
the last sequence with its even in this age impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull would leave many mouths open,positive
one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism,positive
aliens who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in sciencefiction cinema are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful,positive
it is very ironic when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story howard hawks thing and byron haskins war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind,positive
spielbergs humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era the only hint of the contemporary gloom is postwatergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public,positive
but even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chainsmoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to xfiles and its more cynical and disturbing visions,positive
there lies the main and probably the only flaw of this great picture lack of conflict and consequently lack of drama,positive
the movie has few excitements or even action scenes especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcocks north by northwest but generally almost everyone neary jillian government aliens are the good guys,positive
despite such shortcomings the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles,positive
richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary yet nice guy who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale,positive
melinda dillon was on the other hand nominated for oscar as a struggling mother yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as nearys longsuffering wife ronnie,positive
apart from visual wonders of this film spielbergs semiofficial composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot and as the basis for his score,positive
the aliens who are the main subject of this film were visually very convincing,positive
too convincing one of my acquaintances in the uforesearching circles said,positive
according to him the depiction of extraterrestrials as greyskinned little people with big eyes was so accurate that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos,positive
so they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien this time designed to be anything but the real life,positive
the result was e t for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts,positive
anyway whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema,positive
did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion,positive
that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward with a comatose sunny von bulow,positive
she is the main narrator of the film in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder,positive
the dramatic trick works as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder sex unhappiness and a lawyers moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win,positive
jeremy irons is claus von bulow in what is his finest role and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history,positive
he is as hated as any man alive as cold as a cucumber,positive
his remorse for his wifes comatose condition is nonexistant and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas 1980,positive
the background to the case is such,positive
during christmas of 1979 sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke,positive
the same situation occured in 1980 only sunny never woke and probably never will,positive
when examined it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood,positive
claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson convicted and freed on bail,positive
he immediately hires alan dershowitz the renowed harvard law professor to acquit him,positive
ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him,positive
we follow him through two very different cases the case of the johnson case where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didnt commit and von bulow who he still hasnt figured out,positive
dershowitz doesnt know what happened to sunny and he is extremely hesitant to take the case,positive
nevertheless he does based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him,positive
together with a group of law students dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed,positive
silvers performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film,positive
schroeder directs on many different levels with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz,positive
there are flaws at times the film gets overly theatrical,positive
yet due to glenn closes troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well,positive
the flashbacks are good but at times schroeder doesnt fill in the blanks,positive
the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film and it could have used a better ending,positive
the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly without any intelligent conclusion,positive
the supporting characters are often neglected and dershowitzs team should have been allowed to grow character wise but schroeder oversimplifies the story and the characters,positive
yet for all these flaws the film is deeply engrossing because of irons,positive
as von bulow he is brutally evil,positive
antisemitic prejudiced arrogant protective he is a rotten lying monster whose conviction may have been wrong legally but morally he was to blame,positive
irons plays him to a cold perfection with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence,positive
he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder,positive
however the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility,positive
there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wifes death by years of neglect and coldness,positive
however legally did he do the murder,positive
schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind,positive
with all the character flaws reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent he wants the viewer to make up his own mind,positive
schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow in death,positive
for all the failed dramatic theatrics this is one that works beautifully,positive
we dont know what happened,positive
that sense of legal ambiguousness along with von bulows obvious moral guilt is why reversalf fortune works,positive
in the end von bulow is as sadistic as ever,positive
irons is haunting and that is why reversal of fortune is so good,positive
ingredients neophyte lawyer legal situations corrupt insurance company,positive
synopsis rudy baylor matt damon is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time,positive
rudys girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband rudys elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded and the family of rudys friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldnt pay for a bone marrow transplant,positive
rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser danny devito who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge danny glover,positive
jon voight plays leo f drummond the intimidating and arrogant leader of the allpowerful insurance companys team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice,positive
will rudy defeat leo,positive
will he enjoy being a lawyer,positive
opinion the good news is that this movie has a happy ending and it features a guy trying to do the right thing,positive
director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie,positive
in the typical lawyer movie theres one big case and the movie focuses on solving it and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins after lots of gripping courtroom drama,positive
however coppolas movie is deliberately more low key,positive
the rainmaker plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters,positive
in the background rudys voice narrates his feelings and makes halfcynical jokes about the legal profession in general,positive
two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be,positive
first rudys time is split juggling three cases rather than concentrating on a single highstakes case,positive
also rudys use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge,positive
the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win and rudy narrates his way into coming of age,positive
its ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original directors cut of the film,positive
films such as aliens the abyss the wild bunch blade runner and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmakers integrity later chopped up or mucked with by the studio,positive
the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films,positive
the dvd release of the original international version of luc bessons 1995 masterpiece the professional which is known as l on around the world is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a directors cut,positive
for years i have heard of an international version available only in laserdisc format which has eluded me for years,positive
i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors cuts including l on,positive
but after countless searches in laserdisc stores i could never find it,positive
until now,positive
the film follows the story of l on played by jean reno a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello,positive
he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12yearold girl named mathilda played by then newcomer natalie portman whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops,positive
one day a crew of the cops lead by gary oldman in an overthetop performance kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries,positive
taking pity on her l on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life,positive
mathilda learns of l ons hit man profession and decides to follow in l ons footsteps as a cleaner,positive
she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l on he has kept locked away as part of his profession,positive
at this point the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in,positive
the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l on and mathilda footage that american censors deemed too explicit,positive
i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle,positive
the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathildas and l ons motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops,positive
theres even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jeanhugues anglade star of queen margot bessons la femme nikita and killing zoe,positive
with these additional scenes replaced l on and matildas relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version,positive
the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes the film becomes primarily a heavy emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film,positive
the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema,positive
my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional throw down twenty bucks and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece,positive
luc besson producer luc besson claude besson starring jean reno natalie portman gary oldman danny aiello,positive
ive never been a huge fan of jeff bridges but i loved him in the big lebowski,positive
the part of jeff the dude lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind and the fit is perfect,positive
the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians,positive
hes enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes,positive
after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy but not before they urinate on his rug,positive
the dude assumes that these collection agents were after another jeff lebowski a famous millionaire who also lives in l a so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug,positive
the millionaire refuses but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped,positive
he wants the dude to act as gobetween for the kidnapers,positive
dude and his friend walter john goodman take on the task and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers millionaires high schoolers nihilists artists pornographers thugs and league bowlers,positive
comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres so take my recommendation as you will for me the big lebowski is very funny,positive
it is an incredibly successful comedy the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films,positive
not only are the two leads bridges and goodman funny separately and together but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure,positive
all the characters end up as the butt of jokes but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived,positive
each person may be a comic caricature but there is always a respectful selfacceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension,positive
the characters are firmly established and they never change their behavior for a quick cheap laugh,positive
its not what they do thats funny its who they are which is why the acting is so important and so successful in this movie,positive
worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus thats jeezus not haysoos the greaser bowler whos in a lusty marriage with the game julianne moore as the postpostfeminist artist whose work has been described as vaginal steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter and sam elliott as the rambling longwinded narrator,positive
aside from the performances what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue,positive
people lose trains of thought they interrupt they boast they repeat themselves they repeat their friends,positive
they sound natural,positive
taken with fargo the coen brothers last film it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers,positive
ethan coen is not just good at directing actors hes also good at technical directing,positive
he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film,positive
perhaps beautiful is the wrong word nihilists carpetpissers and thugs are not objects of beauty,positive
but the bowling photography and a series of fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film,positive
all around the big lebowski is great solid comedy,positive
outstanding acting writing direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success,positive
seven is one of the best mystery movies ive ever seen,positive
its extremely intriguing and suspenseful but its also quite fun,positive
its a serial killer mystery but you dont care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer,positive
the story is a copsonthetrailofserialkiller mystery,positive
someone is murdering people who are offenders of the seven deadly sins,positive
a fat man gluttony was forced to eat himself to death a lawyer greed is slaughtered by his own rich possessions,positive
i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much,positive
what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the good guys which makes the unseen villain seem so vile,positive
brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills the cocky rookie,positive
however morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset the wise veteran on the verge of retirement and he doesnt get killed by the end,positive
there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief,positive
this is impressive because the mood is so tense and the fact that it can be downplayed as well as it is here let alone at all is quite an accomplishment,positive
the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil scary place many believe it to be,positive
the production design is superb in the spirit of batman and the crow this film embodies the gothic mood,positive
the way the words fade in and out along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level even the credits are scary,positive
the killers victims have no connections at all and thus mills and sommerset dont have much to go on to solve the case,positive
they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense,positive
we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown,positive
not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this,positive
the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect,positive
lets just say it seems a little too mystery movie or too convenient in other words,positive
when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe a terrific chase scene ensues,positive
this is a typical thrilling element but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story,positive
if anything this film is the epitome of twist endings,positive
i dont have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal but the way in which this happens is surprising,positive
there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives and even though hes obviously insane his charisma makes for some good points,positive
whats even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the films resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is,positive
seven is not just a film about crime but about the evil within man,positive
john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of scum,positive
but as justified as he makes himself seem we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice,positive
it stands as a moment one will not soon forget a giant green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds,positive
this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek dreamworks second computer animated feature but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema a page of this tale serves as that ogres toilet paper,positive
from this opening moment one can infer shreks defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard disneyesque fairy tale,positive
although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship courage and acceptance excelled by outstanding direction stunning actor voice work and most importantly a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye,positive
while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline shrek the previously mentioned ogre holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community,positive
the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider known only as the donkey his species who talks and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world,positive
the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way,positive
their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone,positive
shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey,positive
courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines along the journey to rescue fiona donkeys immeasurable cowardice reveals itself,positive
whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without selfacknowledgment,positive
but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant firebreathing dragon guarding fiona either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage,positive
he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them,positive
secondly upon shreks and donkeys redeeming of princess fiona the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her to satisfy her desire for a human knight in shining armor,positive
throughout this storyline shrek faces his deep perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona,positive
an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth but eventually shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona,positive
children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it if one sets mind to overcoming something in particular endless possibilities exist,positive
after the friendships and courage prevail the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development acceptance,positive
surprisingly fiona holds a dark secret of her own due to a spell cast upon her years ago she transforms into an ogre by night,positive
in this storyline fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself and she must realize what beauty truly means to simply act as ones self,positive
upon fionas learning of shreks desire to pursue a relationship with her fiona knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work gives in to her inner demons of selfridicule and hatred,positive
any child can pull from fionas transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of selfacceptance,positive
on the technical side shrek triumphs,positive
directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters,positive
these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers shrek eddie murphy donkey and cameron diaz princess fiona,positive
myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other normal beings,positive
murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the highstrung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen,positive
cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona giving the a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack,positive
while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay written by ted elliott terry rossio joe stillman and roger s h,positive
schulman,positive
the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike,positive
capping it off with a constant tongueincheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers,positive
with shrek dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly oneupped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come,positive
the smaller children will laugh and cheer the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not,positive
a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages,positive
andrew lloyd webbers musicals preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time,positive
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as oklahoma or the slapstickness of shows like a funny thing happened on the way to the forum,positive
they instead tackle hot issues from our past and view them differently and pack them together with redundant catchy music as well as thoughtful lyrics,positive
like jesus christ superstar which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective in the cool tune superstar a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didnt spread his message wider evita takes an inventive stance on its topic this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator juan per n eva who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent among other things,positive
evita deals with the rise and fall of eva per n a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died at the young age of 33 creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di the two do share a bit in common although it wasnt like di slept to the top,positive
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals but they always have a point for doing it,positive
here they wish to expose her for what she is but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks her lying and covering up for her fascist husband but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions and her death was very sad,positive
its also a musical with almost no words not unsung,positive
the film plays like a rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience but also a very entertaining one,positive
after all this is a musical and webbers musicals never undermine this,positive
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth walking on a fine line between the both and never stumbling on either side,positive
this is why the beginning of evita is kind of a letdown,positive
okay it is a letdown,positive
im not saying the opening moments are bad because theyre pretty good,positive
but what comes after is a lifeless unentertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer jimmy nail into taking eva to buenos aires after a onenight stand,positive
in the musical its a fun energetic sequence culiminating in the show stopper buenos aires which is also lifeless,positive
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer instead of her leaving him where she ends up singing the sad tune another suitcase in another hall which was meant for a later character screwed over by eva,positive
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted it for the screen are afraid to present her for what she is even while its being narrated by a hater of evas the omnipotent antonio banderas who presents her in a negative light,positive
for a while it looks like alan parker cant pull it off,positive
however the film pulls itself together in a flash and after that song is over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend is magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful,positive
from this point on the film is hypnotic satisfying and satirical,positive
no more punches are thrown and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact,positive
we see eva woo and marry juan get him out of jail rise to stardom falter a bit come back and then gradually die of cancer i think it was because of cancer,positive
more importantly many of the themes from the musical carry on with this as well as some fillinginthegaps reconnassaince work,positive
juan who is pretty underwritten in the musical is given some extra scenes and exposed as what he was for eva an accessory,positive
a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than we did before,positive
from the goodbye and thank you number on the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation and saved a government even while it left the nations people downtrodden,positive
but despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she was a star,positive
thats when our narrator ch comes out to show that she wasnt the great woman she really was and expose her fame,positive
describing this character is difficult mainly because he has no real realistic background hes said to be based on the revolutionary ch guevera but the two probably could have never met like they do in the film but he serves as a perspective on eva but even his perspective cant help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death,positive
alan parker no stranger to bizarre musicals hes done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter which is absolutely brilliant nails the film exposing everything for what it is,positive
we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should by the way it is presented,positive
his direction is manipulative for a reason to show the mourning for what it is,positive
and there is energy throughout with lots of bright colors and scenes which are cinematically entertaning as well as enriching and deep such as the balcony scene where she sings dont cry for me argentina and her death sequence which is poignant becuase of how sad it is,positive
madonnas golden globe winning performance is much like the movie starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly remaning there for the rest of the film,positive
at the beginning she looks like shes too busy concentrating on her singing to act but she eventually gets it right though never really getting the presence of say patti lupone who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s,positive
her death though is brilliant,positive
her singing could be better though,positive
i know she took lessons to improve her range and all but it still sounds like shes trying to hard,positive
she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding like patti,positive
lupone i heard her sing on an old evita cd and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her,positive
but its generally very good although not up to the brilliance the role really requires,positive
antonio banderas who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days im one of the few people who thinks he rocks is extremely comanding in his performance presenting a lovable narrator,positive
his singing is very good though nothing compared to the original mandy patinkin,positive
he does have a pretty good singing voice and a great range,positive
and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome although very brief at times in his role as juan seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade,positive
although it gets off to a rocky start rocky s polite for what it really is it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical,positive
like the other musical released in 96 woody allens everyone says i love you its a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance,positive
the event of events is upon us,positive
people have waited twentytwo years for the prequel to star wars and diehard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it,positive
i dont think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused,positive
it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history,positive
anyone who tells you its just a movie is either lying or clueless,positive
it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic,positive
the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz which is far too weak a word that star wars epsode i the phantom menace so effortlessly generated,positive
but that does not mean that the film itself is bad,positive
in fact it is terrific,positive
i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash,positive
it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place,positive
the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo,positive
the republic sent two jedi knights people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as the force quigon jinn liam neeson and obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor to negotiate,positive
unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene,positive
on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine where they meet the movies real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd,positive
he is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong with him so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi,positive
as any selfrespecting star wars fan should know anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker,positive
from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actors movie,positive
around 70 of the characters if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effects are seamless the movie lacks soul,positive
i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this,positive
this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far with plenty of broad comic relief to go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jarjar binks,positive
hes essentially a computeranimated sidekick who says things like exqueeze me,positive
and mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying,positive
the visual effects are astounding although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them and the movie is a thrilling triumph,positive
if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement,positive
the climactic lightsaber battle oh come on as if you didnt already know among other things is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie,positive
what made me surrender and give this movie 12 stars was the score by john williams,positive
even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days his work here is nothing short of brilliant,positive
his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling,positive
the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia,positive
when you see a long time ago in a galaxy far far away when the familiar music plays when the words star wars appear on screen youll feel a tingle even if you didnt see the movie when it first came out in 77,positive
it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin a boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side,positive
it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not,positive
we not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like were seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years,positive
the phantom menace although lacking in human aspects of the story is a very worthy installment in the star wars,positive
it works as an action flick visually eyepopping and often paralyzingly exciting it also works as an elicitor of memories a piece of exquisite nostalgia,positive

tarzan chadz good 1999 g 90 minutes 1 hour 30 minutes animated starring the voices of tony goldwyn tarzan minnie driver jane porter lance henriksen kerchak brian blessed clayton written by tab murphy bob tzudiker noni white produced by bonnie arnold directed by chris buck kevin lima based on the story tarzan of the apes and characters created by edgar rice burroughs,positive
seen july 4 1999 at 7 15 p m at crossgates cinemas 18 guilderland ny theater 9 by myself for free using my hoyts season pass,positive
theater rating 12 very good sound picture and seats,positive
title tarzan beautiful to look at easy to follow,positive
review disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story,positive
the basic premise is the same as every other tarzan story a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding or even noticing that hes human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends,positive
the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala voiced by glen close a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism,positive
her mate kerchak henriksen is a mean conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzans extended family,positive
he refuses to acknowledge tarzan voiced by alex d linz during the childhood scenes as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts,positive
i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and its funny how the adults fail to comprehend this,positive
later as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a fullgrown man voiced by goldwyn he is encounter by a party of three humans from england jane porter driver a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist her father prof archimedes q porter voiced by nigel hawthorne who is also a scientist and their slick and cunning yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton blessed,positive
its easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesnt seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for childrens enjoyment,positive
sure theres a lot of cliche stuff here like claytons smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane the goofy supporting characters voiced by rosie odonnell in full brooklyn accent and wayne knight hello newman,positive
theres also a lot of fun action such as tarzans swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks,positive
its just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks those mcdonalds commercials really prove this point,positive
ultimately you get exactly out of tarzan what you expect,positive
and i mean that as a compliment so have high expectations,positive
pros animation and sound are a feast for the senses story is lighthearted breezy and not dumbeddown no stupid singalong songs to get stuck in your head,positive
cons surprisingly violent should have been rated pg,positive
young children may not understand some of the more adult themes parents be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way,positive
running time is a bit short,positive
would you recommend this to friends,positive
not to my friends but to the moviegoing public i would,positive
score or with no 0 rating,positive
whats shocking about carlitos way is how good it is,positive
having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacinos previous film scent of a woman and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one he had just won an oscar carlitos way was destined for underrated heaven,positive
thats what it is an underrated gem of a movie,positive
and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study,positive
carlitos way deals with well carlito brigante pacino a puerto rican exdrug kingpin who gets out of a long jailterm when his cokeaddicted curlyhaired lawyer sean penn points out a legal technicality,positive
of course carlito was actually awoken in prison and has decided to go straight even if hes really a crook at heart,positive
carlito like barry lyndon is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn and cant escape into something he is not,positive
carlitos attempts at a clean legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn,positive
when he first gets out a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shootout where he has to kill a couple people to survive,positive
hes constantly getting bugged by the government to see if hes doing anything illegal and his lawyer finds himself neckdeep in a pile of shit needing him to try and help him out which includes him doing some prison breaking,positive
carlito like ratso rizzo wants to go to miami since according to film logic thats where its at but needs some funding,positive
being a legend he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club this is the 70s by the way and since some of this takes place in night clubs we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics including several k c,positive
and the sunshine band tunes my personal favorite,positive
he gets a bodyguard the great luis guzman at his best and is soon running a pretty good business even if hes constantly attracting underworld young thugs like benny blanco from the bronx john leguiziamo who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito,positive
on the other side the symbol of promise and hope is gail penelope ann miller what happened to her his girlfriend from before prison,positive
shes a goregeous ballerina and a stripper and soon carlito is trying to get back with her and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami,positive
while this relationship is never fully defined or anything we get a sense of love between them and they have some truly interesting scenes between them she never gives him addresses or locales he always has to track her down,positive
all of these elements clash together at the end in a brilliantly executed emotional climax which is inevitable,positive
when i say inevitable i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack putting a great spin on it,positive
sure its going to eleveate some of the tension but it gives the film a lot of depth as carlito is seen trapped by fate,positive
whats amazing is the big chase sequence amazingly done by de palma has a lot of tension and thrills,positive
like apollo 13 we know whats going to happen but were still thrilled by what happens in the middle,positive
its also very emotional thanks to a great script by david koepp and amazing performances by pacino and miller,positive
de palma is famous or infamous for lots of violence in his films,positive
his earlier flim scarface which starred pacino in the lead has a ton of it especially at the end and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which im still not over,positive
but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes,positive
to me the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet,positive
this is the most brilliantly done and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film and probably the best in de palma film history,positive
with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlitos head and a saddened remorseful look on pacinos face its a tearjerker well for me i dunno about you,positive
the acting from all is great especially from the three leads,positive
pacino was panned for his performance chiefly because his accent wasnt puerto rican enough and well it wasnt as strong as his oscarwinning role in scent of a woman,positive
well his scent of a woman performance was great and all but it was nothing really but as comic kevin pollack said a foghorn leghorn impression,positive
in carlitos way hes emotional and strong despite the fact that hes remorseful over his entire lifestyle which he cannot change,positive
i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tangodancing insultthrowing blind guy in scent of a woman,positive
as i said penelope ann miller is great and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry,positive
and theyre scenes are wellwritten with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship,positive
and sean penn is amazing as the cokeaddicted rat attorney,positive
every scene hes in he has great energy and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino,positive
in smaller roles john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great,positive
carlitos way is one of those films which you heard about briefly but when you finally watch it youre absolutely blown away,positive
its a wonderful film a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didnt do so hot,positive
but trust me and check it out,positive
its a great little film and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right,positive
fritz langs first american film since leaving nazi germany is an eyeopener about a lynch mob in a small town,positive
joe wilson spencer tracy is a regular joe a hardworking stiff a decent guy who is living with his two brothers tom walcott and charlie albertson in chicago,positive
he is engaged to katherine grant sylvia sidney but cant save up enough money to marry her,positive
she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher,positive
before she departs she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother sews up his ripped trench coat corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento and kisses him goodbye,positive
a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station,positive
driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her he arrives at a nearby town called strand,positive
but the deputy sheriff buggs meyers walter brennan comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him,positive
he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl,positive
the sheriff ellis finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money and he fits the general description of the suspect,positive
locked in jail he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence,positive
in the local bar the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping,positive
fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect a mob storms the jail burns it down and dynamites it when they cant get through to the prisoners jail cell,positive
the sheriff called the governor for the national guard but one of his political advisers countermanded that request saying it wouldnt look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him,positive
somehow joe escapes but his dog rainbow dies,positive
katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell and becomes convinced that he died,positive
the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses,positive
joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers who are startled to see him alive that he wants revenge,positive
he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob,positive
an ambitious district attorney walter abel prosecutes the 22 for murder,positive
katherine not knowing hes alive remains in a state of shock but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death,positive
the defense claims that it cant be a charge of murder without a corpse,positive
the trial proves to be interesting as the citizens in this closeknit respectable community lie under oath providing alibis for each other to prove they couldnt have been at the jail,positive
the sheriff also lies saying he cant identify anyone in the mob,positive
but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film,positive
as for proof of the corpse an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe,positive
in the note memento is misspelled which makes katherine realize that joe is alive,positive
when the sentence is announced 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened,positive
katherine forgives him and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have,positive
but dont blame lang for all the changes in the film of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive,positive
mgm couldnt bear to have it made the way lang wanted it that is by having tracy die in the lynching,positive
instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script,positive
to langs credit even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook,positive
his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised,positive
you couldnt help get the feeling that the citizens didnt care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail even perjuring themselves,positive
their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they werent going to be convicted,positive
lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident,positive
he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed and the innocent jovial goodguy seen in the beginning of the film has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience,positive
this has some major spoilers for the film so be forwarned,positive
the wont appear till later in the article so youre safe for now,positive
eyes wide shot 1999 running time 2 hours 39 minutes 2 35 1 theatrical aspect,positive
starring tom cruise dr,positive
bill hardford nicole kidman alice hardford sidney pollack leelee sobieski todd field nick nightingale directed cowritten produced by stanley kubrick inspired by traumnovelle by arthur schnitzer,positive
this is an interesting film,positive
i must first off state that you musnt believe any of the rumors of the film,positive
cruise is not a cross dresser kidman doesnt shoot heroin and theres not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist,positive
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written,positive
the translation dream novel makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film,positive
there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film,positive
rather than complain about it as some may and already have see it as a style of shooting,positive
i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could,positive
this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly,positive
as an auteur and stickler for details kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one,positive
the film looks great but there are a good deal of that occur,positive
you see lots of boom shots in reflection and you see the camera at least twice,positive
16 months for this,positive
wow,positive
reflection is the biggest killer for this film,positive
their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these some quite glaringly,positive
one more topic of heated discussion i saw the austin powers version and to be perfectly frank unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be youll probably not see them,positive
two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way its supposed to be,positive
spoilers below,positive
the film itself starts with cruise bill and kidman alice getting ready for a little xmas soiree,positive
they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment which is actually an apartment owned by pollack,positive
bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the partys entertainment,positive
soon after bill and alice are flirting with others at the party thinking that the other has not noticed,positive
bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time,positive
the next day bill and alice casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations,positive
they both discover that they both knew about the flirting,positive
bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship and gets alice extremely angry,positive
in her hazy state she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill not caring about the possible aftereffects,positive
bill gets called away when one of his patients dies and goes to console his daughter,positive
when his patients engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife alice and a naval officer,positive
he sees opportunity as a betrayal to his wife and before they can continue they are interrupted,positive
as he strolls home he encounters a hooker,positive
seeing another opportunity arise he follows the hooker home,positive
they toy around but before the act ensues alice calls his cell phone,positive
he breaks the date with the hooker and heads back out into the night,positive
he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing so he heads in,positive
when he meets the friend the friend reveals that for extra scratch he plays these strange parties while blindfolded,positive
bill is intrigued and wants to go to one,positive
nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password,positive
what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl leelee sobieski and her father,positive
the young girl has drawn his eye but her young age and the prescence of her father deter this from happening,positive
he gets to the party which is to say the least a strange affair,positive
after partaking in some strange religious right women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies,positive
a woman warns bill in disguise that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party,positive
he is detained after a second warning where he is outed for not being in the group,positive
after getting home he hides the evidence of his evenings events,positive
unable to carry on in his day he tries piece the events of the previous night together,positive
in the process he finds that nick has disappeared his life is possibly in danger and the woman that warned him has died,positive
im trying to save a bit of the film here its worth sitting through to get to this point,positive
this is only about 100 minutes at this point,positive
this is a strange film because despite the events that occur the film has a strong family message behind it,positive
it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film,positive
its got sex in it it has nudity drugs and many more immoralistic values,positive
but they all serve to show why they are bad in ones life,positive
i recommend this film highly on many merits,positive
cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself,positive
seen at the 21st portland international film festival,positive
film title supermarket woman director juzo itami country japan 1997 cinematography yonezo maeda music toshiyuki honda cast nobuko miyamoto masahitko tsugawa shiro ito yuji miyake akiko matsumoto super features typical itami film,positive
funny and pointed in its own way,positive
if you dont care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket then this film is not for you,positive
maybe it is better to ignore it as this strong and biting satire as only juzo itami can deliver will give you an insight as to what some foods go through,positive
having in the past made films that pulled every punch imaginable from the family traditions the funeral to taxes a taxing woman a taxing woman returns to the diabolical gangsters minbo to hospitals the seriously ill juzo itami this time takes on the supermarkets own war to get the consumers,positive
and while this film has its funny side in the crazy situations that it creates it also shows another side which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer,positive
goro has a supermarket,positive
and a competitor comes into the neighborhood trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket,positive
bargains galore its name has in mind the closure of goros humbler venue so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can,positive
goro hires hanako a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management than they are in anything else,positive
hanako as she gets familiar with the operation discovers many of the tricks of the trade done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market,positive
and the procedures are not always fresh food but a new packaging and a new date to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves,positive
hanakos ideas take hold starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket being that they do not even shop there at all,positive
and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference,positive
if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store,positive
a price error forces them to give away eggs for very low prices and causes the store a few hassles but it brought the people in and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things,positive
as the operation gets stronger the competition also has trickery up its sleeve and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors,positive
eventually these people are found out and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully until in the end they all have a showdown,positive
and here the truth and honesty win out and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent,positive
in the process they also find that freshness with some very funny jokes on this word as well becomes a much more important tool than they imagined,positive
with some very nice performances in this hectic and fast paced film this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much even though towards the end it is suggested,positive
but this would take away from the satire and its strengths,positive
with food gags all over the place the film lets you have it,positive
and what fun it is,positive
worth seeing,positive
editorial the director of this film juzo itami died shortly after the film was finished and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare and uncompromising,positive
we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making of which he must have had a few stories to tell but we will have to do with much of the japanese society and its many errant ways,positive
not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else,positive
america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all should anyone have the guts to tackle it,positive
we could learn something along the way too,positive
worth seeing specially is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns,positive
the funeral is also good although not as funny as the later films,positive
tampopo is also very enjoyable,positive
all four of these films are available in video which means your best local site for foreign film may have them,positive
ask for it,positive
if he doesn92t watch out mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max,positive
of course there are still a few big guns in this film but there92s some accomplished acting too,positive
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty antihero skin as his career progresses here he explores a new genre the businessman as action hero,positive
in ron howard92s latest film gibson plays tom mullen a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers,positive
mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation,positive
a veteran of numerous hardnosed business negotiations the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive he has to play his hand differently,positive
the casting is what puts this film over the top,positive
the trio of gibson the kidnappers mastermind gary sinise and fbi team leader delroy lindo play off of each other wonderfully,positive
sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark,positive
his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h g wells92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of,positive
society mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below feeding off the unsuspecting,positive
gibson92s character is an allamerican hero with a few flaws,positive
his cowboy,positive
tactics tend to work but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with,positive
in a round about way if he weren92t known as a man who i s willing to buy his way out of trouble his son wouldn92t have been kidnapped,positive
as sinise says you92re a payer,positive
you did it once and now you92re going to do it again,positive
one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities,positive
lindo calls home to talk to his kids obviously shaken at working this case,positive
even the kidnappers are real people arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars,positive
gibson92s breakdown on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective,positive
it92s one of the best filmed representations of a man92s world falling apart that i92ve seen,positive
it92s not all perfect,positive
the shoot em upending while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution,positive
as well crafted as the scene is we92ve seen it before,positive
mullen92s wife rene russo has several good moments but occasionally just seems to be there,positive
while adequate brawley nolte sean doesn92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around,positive
but you92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one,positive
forget about the large coke you won92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later,positive
james cmaerons breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok,positive
for those of you who do not know the plot in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race,positive
human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed,positive
however some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor,positive
to stop connor the machines send a terminator arnold schwarzenegger back to 1984 to murder connors mother sara linda hamilton and thus prevent connor from ever being born,positive
in response the humans send a protector kyle reese played by michael biehn,positive
images of machines and of humans reliance on machines dominate the film,positive
even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 humans continue to use the machines,positive
in the climax of star wars luke relies on the force alonehis own spiritual powerto destroy the death star,positive
in the terminator however sara must use another machinea giant hydraulic pressto vanquish her enemy,positive
cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapableand hes not happy about it,positive
unabated technological growth brings about the terminators other obsession the apocalypse,positive
we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la,positive
children watch the flames in a burning television,positive
when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him,positive
even though the future is not set there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence,positive
all sara can do is await it,positive
cameron doesnt wimp out like he does in terminator 2,positive
the end of the world is the human races own fault too,positive
after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place,positive
back in 1984 when the cold war was still in full effect the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war another obsession of camerons,positive
these days one can read a criticism of machinelike behavior in humans,positive
true humanizing touches are put into paul winfields and lance henriksens detective characters but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected,positive
cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la,positive
from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done,positive
arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonistunstoppable merciless obdurate,positive
we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzeneggers later works eg commando but fear him,positive
cameron and hurds script basically depicts a one hour and fortyfive minute chase taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot,positive
while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reeses intentions,positive
cameron directs the film at a rapid kinetic pace,positive
either the camera is moving or something within the frame is movingusually both occurs,positive
the violence is not particularly graphic temple of dooms heartpull scene outgrosses the terminators but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective,positive
for a low budget film the terminators special effects and art direction especially in 2029 la are remarkably well done,positive
special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton,positive
it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen,positive
one thing that doesnt hold up after all the years however is linda hamiltons hairdo,positive
when i was asked to see this movie with a friend my initial reaction was not hugh grant,positive
i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker i just could not picture him in any romantic lead,positive
what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script,positive
this writer richard curtis whose exceptional first work four weddings and funeral shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy with splashes of drama thrown in between,positive
hugh and his hair is almost identical to the character that made him famous in four weddings,positive
he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck,positive
unfortunately he is type cast in this role but fortunately it works well for him in this movie,positive
if only he would dither a little less,positive
julia knows this role well,positive
the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love,positive
there are moments in this movie that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness,positive
how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful but to have no one to share it with,positive
the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels,positive
how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment,positive
how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice,positive
even if i did not know that director and cowriters james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the xfiles i would have inevitably made a connection,positive
the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon like plot to the mysterious characters to the overall dark ominous settings,positive
it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie,positive
another more important similarity is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time,positive
this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie especially when compared to some of the trash of the same genre released in the last couple of years urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch,positive
what helps final destination is its unique premise,positive
unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders the villain presented is unusual its the grim reaper,positive
this being already has predestined when and how you will die,positive
according to the brief history lesson given in this film everyone was meant to die at a certain time some people at 100 others at 17 whatever death chooses,positive
what is unique about death is that its already dead so you cant really kill it,positive
the only way to defeat death is to cheat it the question is how do you do that,positive
this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers,positive
alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash leaving no survivors,positive
alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off,positive
shortly after the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal,positive
however death isnt through with them yet,positive
it gradually kills off the seven one by one leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again,positive
the plot allows for some of the most creative original death scenes i have seen in a while,positive
some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock,positive
creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films,positive
sure it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ali larters character is particularly annoying but the shocks from the beginning to the end are extremely entertaining,positive
also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously,positive
he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that wont win any academy awards not even a golden globe,positive
the myriad of inside jokes and gags the characters are named after famous horror directors one character who plays a jerk is named carter like xfiles creator chris carter and a song by john denver who died in a plane crash plays whenever death is near show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie,positive
and from this i had a great time watching the movie,positive
i must admit im going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend,positive
the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity,positive
i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre but something drew me to this film,positive
maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role and the hilarious eugene levy,positive
maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity con air and pushing tin,positive
but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life,positive
the story of serendipity is simple,positive
two people john trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale looking ever so hot have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves with buck henry smack dab in the middle,positive
charmed beyond repair these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf called serendipity talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink,positive
but with each of them already involved with other parties sara has john write his name and number on a 5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera,positive
sara declares that if this thing lets just call it love is destined to happen fate will bring them together in the future,positive
years later and on opposite coasts of america john and sara both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts,positive
what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious catandmouse game with the fates involving such items as mistaken identity a graduate homage john corbett as a freaky new age musician and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman to find out if that thing was right after all,positive
fortunately firsttime screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong wellrounded characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative,positive
coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones and the use of timelapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity,positive
both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters,positive
on the flipside films such as youve got mail made in heaven and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the films main journey at hand,positive
but its what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture,positive
lets say you live at the end of an airport runway,positive
large jetliners continuously pass over your house rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace,positive
lets say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home,positive
now lets say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway and offers you more than its worth,positive
wouldnt you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed,positive
of course you would,positive
but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise and the house your castle,positive
thats what they are to darryl kerrigan michael caton and although hes happy that a multinational corporation would like to buy his home sorry its not for sale,positive
unfortunately the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice,positive
not about to take this lying down darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto tiriel mora and makes a determined albeit pathetic attempt to fight back,positive
the castle an australian comedy by rob sitch is perhaps one of the simplest movies ive seen in recent memory yet also one of the funniest,positive
in fact it is this films reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful,positive
the good guys and the bad guys are clear the humor is straightforward and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets,positive
its the perfect setup for a relaxing hilarious good time and as much as i hate to admit it i liked the fact that i didnt have to think all that much while watching this film,positive
i just sat back and enjoyed myself,positive
the situation is one weve seen before regular joe fights back against the government or big business or whatever,positive
what makes this film different is its characters,positive
darryl thinks hes got the best life in the world he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when hes got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal anne tenny and he swells with pride when his son dale stephen curry digs a hole in the yard,positive
steve kerrigan anthony simcoe constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for investments like jousting sticks and overhead projectors while wayne kerrigan is in jail as a result of dennis denutos incompetent courtroom maneuvers,positive
the great thing about the kerrigans is that they arent so stupid that they get annoying,positive
theyre just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing,positive
we look upon them with a little bit of pity but a whole lot of affection,positive
screenwriters sitch santo cilauro tom gleisner and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans,positive
sympathy for their situation the laughter they bring us and the familys wonderful characterization simple as it may be leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them,positive
i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans but trust me it works,positive
i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs,positive
dont get me wrong slapstick when executed well can be genius,positive
its just that too often a film will resort to its use as a shortcut to amusing the audience not always successfully,positive
instead the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world,positive
when they are by themselves the are funny and when they are with normal people they are hilarious,positive
one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though,positive
the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the films running time,positive
luckily its a funny little detour that while slightly distracting from the films main drive is still quite enjoyable,positive
with all the levity abound in the castle the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes,positive
im not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution of australia and certainly sounds impressive at any rate,positive
and for that matter its more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this,positive
minor plot spoilers in review no major spoilers are in review,positive
the previous two alien films have each had their own unique styles to them,positive
the ridley scotts alien was very much a stylistic suspense film,positive
james camerons aliens was much more of an action film,positive
and i liked each film separately for which it was,positive
now alien 3 is out,positive
and it is its own film in the same right that alien and aliens were,positive
unlike aliens alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens,positive
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off,positive
the survivors of the expedition to lv426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens,positive
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item an egg,positive
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch find its quarry which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel,positive
this vessel crash lands on fury 109,positive
everyone in the vessel is killed except ripley,positive
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash,positive
fury 109 is an ex security prison,positive
when closed down some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet,positive
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years,positive
ripleys arrival sparks a problem with the inmates,positive
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoners sport there is an infestation of lice on the planet,positive
being an exprison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons,positive
so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own,positive
i will not go into detail but you can guess what happens here,positive
the alien is loose and no one believes ripleys outstanding story,positive
she finds comfort in the arms of the colonys doctor,positive
yes after 57 years ripley has sex,positive
it is not gratuitous in fact we dont even see them kiss but it is just as well,positive
a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film,positive
there is a lot more gore in alien 3,positive
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two,positive
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs,positive
i wont say how but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle which i am sure will be explored in alien 4,positive
sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character,positive
her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination,positive
the rest of the cast is also quite good,positive
notably charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109,positive
alien 3 has a very distinct look,positive
this is due largely to its director david fincher,positive
mr fincher who until now has only directed music videos and commercials has done an incredible job here,positive
his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no alien film has before,positive
for mr fincher i see a long prosperous career ahead of him,positive
the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry,positive
elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the alien series been set in,positive
this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii james horners aliens,positive
this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring,positive
this is a great score,positive
the ending to alien 3 is quite good,positive
there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up but it played very nicely,positive
i will not ruin the ending for you,positive
go see the film,positive
i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season,positive
alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien,positive
and when they make alien 4 perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in,positive
studio expectations must not have been high for great expectations the films release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999,positive
its actually a smart move because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isnt quite oscar fodder it is strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year,positive
great expectations also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmanns william shakespeares romeo juliet,positive
great expectations opens somewhere in 1970s florida the original story is set in 19thcentury england as eightyearold finn jeremy james kissner meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future,positive
theres icy 11yearold estella raquel beaudene a pseudoplaymate of finns ms dinsmoor anne bancroft estellas auntie whos quite offkilter over a past romance that never took off and a mysterious prisoner robert de niro whom finn saves the life of,positive
finn who lives with his sisters affable boyfriend lone stars chris cooper fancies himself an aspiring artist and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms dinsmoors lipstick eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion,positive
flash forward into the 90s after a brief stop in the 80s and finn now played by ethan hawke despondent over a strange hotandcold relationship with the elusive estella gwyneth paltrow receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor its enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art,positive
there finn seems to gain everything he could ever want wealth prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world,positive
when estella resurfaces albeit with an aloof fianc hank azaria finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction,positive
but shes not the only ghost from finns past thats going to be paying him a visit,positive
comparisons with the aforementioned romeo juliet seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting,positive
great expectations is a much better venture though because it treats its source with evenhanded respect where romeo was never quite sure whether to be a spoof a homage or both,positive
the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezkis sexy cinematography notably he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious erotic charge thats steamier than the films surprisingly muted love scenes,positive
the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the onscreen action beautifully especially new songs by tori amos mono and duncan sheik,positive
acting credits are firstrate often hiding the screenplays occasional slipups,positive
hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man something we also learned from gattaca and his finn is quite a likeable guy,positive
paltrows estella on the other hand is rather underdeveloped,positive
while the actress is at her icily seductive best were not told very much about her character and as a result its often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level but oh what a physical level sometimes we root for finn although we dont quite understand why shes fueling his fire,positive
robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft a macabre throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous,positive
alfonso cuarons visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movies climax,positive
another problem is predictability you can guess your way through the plot even if you arent familiar with the story,positive
despite its script flaws though great expectations is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy,positive
and frankly its nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality,positive
perhaps that renovated release date awfully close to valentines day will end up helping great expectations seemingly average box office chances after all,positive
okay let me first say this is a beavis and butthead movie,positive
if you do not like beavis and butthead do not go to see this movie,positive
however if you do like them i recommened you get out right now and go see it,positive
the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv,positive
they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it,positive
this wind their way through america searching for dallas she is a woman,positive
they look for her because as they are searching for the tv they find a drunk who wants them to do his wife,positive
well of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her,positive
and the fun starts their,positive
this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off,positive
it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy,positive
i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace,positive
even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag he manages to keep the laughs coming,positive
if you expecting changes from the show keep looking,positive
the same character the same voices the same everything from the show and thats what makes it good,positive
you might think with a movie from a tv show you can change a few things,positive
often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place,positive
is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of alltime,positive
its quite possible,positive
his career spanned over 40 years and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could,positive
yet when he is talked about in the media he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role the nice guy,positive
and thats really a shame,positive
the naked spur features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him,positive
its a western which stewart specialized in around this period and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend,positive
before he finds that man though he runs into two men who agree to help him thinking he is a sheriff,positive
when the criminal is eventually caught the two men discover stewarts secret and decide they want a piece of the action too,positive
the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly,positive
also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal well played by janet leigh,positive
were never too sure whos side shes really on until the end,positive
leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the shower lady from psycho and thats unfair,positive
she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men,positive
stewart gives a performance unlike anything ive ever seen from him,positive
he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs but here he gets downright hysterical at times,positive
i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a nice guy,positive
his performance borders on psychotic at times but i loved watching every second of it,positive
its roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do,positive
he was an actor unafraid to take chances and even ruin his public image,positive
plot odin is a great high school basketball player,positive
hes dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass,positive
in fact the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him,positive
unfortunately the coachs real son hugo isnt too pleased to hear that,positive
in fact he doesnt like hearing about any of odins triumphs as they generally supersede his own,positive
so what does he set out to do,positive
well lets just say that he starts to mess with peoples heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to well,positive
youll see,positive
critique a very powerful thoroughly depressing wellacted nonteen movie starring a bunch of teens,positive
credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic set in a realistic high school environment with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core,positive
you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film who turn over some very convincing performances taking you through all of their characters ups and downs,positive
hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of sign of a good actor if you ask me,positive
phifer also comes to play in this movie with a nice blend of charisma fear love and anger spread over his character,positive
i was always on this guys side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along,positive
julia stiles was also good but her character wasnt much different from others that shes played recently,positive
i was however very surprised with martin sheens showing since i hadnt taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years,positive
his character is definitely overthetop in this film but i appreciated his fervor his rage his ultimate and blind desire to win above all,positive
a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest,positive
i did have a few reservations about the movie though,positive
first of all what was with all of the gangsta hiphop music used in pretty much every other scene transition,positive
it was cute at first but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times,positive
the film was also edited pretty choppily like,positive
some scenes were cut out and no one cleaned it up afterwards,positive
i also didnt like the fact that hartnetts character the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film was infallible,positive
in other words pretty much everything he says or asks of someone happens automatically and without any goofups,positive
i mean i know the guy is smart and all but i would have appreciated a little more realism under some of the circumstances,positive
but overall the movie will devastate you,positive
its not a fun date movie,positive
its not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks,positive
its about jealousy love envy fury passion revenge and pretty much any other negative thought thats ever passed through your head,positive
is it worth seeing,positive
oh most definitely,positive
pun intended its a moving picture with great performances no shakespearian speak thank you god and an outstanding directorial job by nelson,positive
the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine and i was especially impressed with the directors choice of music near the end,positive
in fact the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver and i guess thats saying something right there,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
10 things i hate about you 710 election 710 hamlet 610 loves labors lost 810 natural born killers 910 save the last dance 710 shakespeare in love 510,positive
a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal,positive
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nationstate against another,positive
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain,positive
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end,positive
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues,positive
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label,positive
edward zwicks the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states,positive
youd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines,positive
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the u s responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack,positive
however unlike the reallife tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin ladens camp and manufacturing facility the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal,positive
in retaliation the terrorists bring the fight to the new world,positive
unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agentincharge anthony hubbard denzel washington who works out of the bureaus new york office at one federal plaza,positive
while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple he encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying to uncover information,positive
generally the fbi is charged with problems inside the u s while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm,positive
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country,positive
hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form a tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government,positive
the original tagline for patriot games was there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil,positive
however true it was pulled before the movies release because it sounded too much like a dare,positive
revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america,positive
admittedly the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive whos going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by twothirds but the basic premise is still valid,positive
i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic actionthriller fare of good guy gmen against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order,positive
it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arabamerican population and that in an effort to find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself,positive
in fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk,positive
although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups,positive
throughout the film maintains a conflict between hubbard who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully,positive
what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides,positive
it actually gets rather heady at times but its a credit to screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they dont underestimate the intelligence of the audience,positive
i dont know if its his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great,positive
this combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the midlevel authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable,positive
annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character ive seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable,positive
its somewhat unfortunate that her characters fortitude is broken at a certain point but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range,positive
bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a toughguy role always standing straight and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face,positive
however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the films development,positive
notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad a lebanese immigrant,positive
the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society,positive
difficult to say the least shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch,positive
perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night,positive
whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwicks favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer,positive
i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific scorewriter graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabianthemed music and horners record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irishsounding at most,positive
revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole,positive
its nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films weve been getting throughout the year,positive
missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes,positive
for example its pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick,positive
unfortunately theres a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eyecatching,positive
in the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops,positive
verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point,positive
the film also gets a little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races to get along,positive
a noble gesture the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously,positive
these flaws are glaring but they dont detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class,positive
there is a striking scene early in city of angels where all the angels who live unseen in our midst gather at the beach to watch the sun rise,positive
the camera moves above them showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women all garbed in black,positive
then the camera moves in on the face of seth an angel played by nicolas cage and as the sun rises he smiles and his entire face lights up,positive
you see the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets but they cannot feel a human touch,positive
it is an important scene for several reasons,positive
first of all it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible,positive
the film presents these fantastic beings as normallooking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth watching what goes on with little interference,positive
there are none of the standard hokey angel references used in recent films like angels in the outfield 1994 or michael 1996,positive
the angels here are stark and believable,positive
this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition for its shows how gods angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs or the smell of the salt in the air,positive
there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel although there is much beauty in it as well,positive
they eternally walk the earth listening to our thoughts touching us in our pain and leading the dying to heaven,positive
like human existence being an angel is often confused and unsure,positive
city of angels is essentially a love story between seth and a human a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan,positive
he first sees her when he is in her operating room waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven,positive
maggie is distraught doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table and seth is moved by her efforts and more importantly her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies,positive
angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain and seth does what he can with his invisible touch but its not enough,positive
he wants to be with her and share her pain not just stand back at a distance,positive
he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to fall and become human,positive
he learns this from another fallen angel played by dennis franz n y p d,positive
blue in a touching and humorous performance,positive
sitting at a diner together franz tells cages character about how wonderful it is to be human to be able to taste food feel another persons skin smell the air and most importantly have a loving wife and children,positive
of course there is pain to go along with all this but for seth it will be worth it,positive
city of angels is something of a reinterpretation of wim wenders haunting 1988 film wings of desire,positive
wenders film was more like a poem it was the feeling the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened,positive
the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human,positive
and unlike most foreign films that are remade into hollywood fare it doesnt suffer extensive damage,positive
this may be because director brad silberling casper and screenwriter dana stevens blink wanted to make city of angels its own movie inspired by wings of desire but not an attempt to copy it,positive
and yet city of angels is not a typical hollywood movie,positive
it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale the english patient whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world,positive
seale creates many striking visuals in addition to the beach scene there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by,positive
while the film travels along a charted plot it takes time to develop its characters and situations it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly and shows just how thin those boundaries are,positive
both cage and ryan give soulful softspoken performances,positive
ryan who is usually so bouncy and energetic truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch,positive
cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple heartfelt gazes and speaks with the comforting knowing voice that only an angel could have,positive
what is most striking about city of angels is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay which is both unexpected and challenging,positive
its not a formulaic hollywood ending because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time,positive
it doesnt give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance,positive
instead it offers something much better something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive,positive

an eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http www bigfoot comjimkendrick,positive
email jimkendrick com,positive
its terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of 1996s unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than a month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office,positive
these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama,positive
additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist,positive
and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary,positive
i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits,positive
adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens with a cute sixyearold boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath,positive
he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there,positive
finally he asks does it hurt to be dead,positive
apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isnt the focus of the picture,positive
instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist,positive
jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hardworking wife,positive
one night while at a party with their closest friends tom convinces maggies newage sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him,positive
it unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he wouldnt normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months,positive
seeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door,positive
she didnt expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees,positive
stir of echoes isnt a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horrordrama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling workingclass family,positive
kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe 1997s dream with the fishes are topnotch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems,positive
after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit,positive
bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet,positive
in a masterfullydone entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness,positive
lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater,positive
telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep,positive
never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantlyconstrued as this one,positive
truthfully this setpiece and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen,positive
having loads of fun with her small role as maggies sister lisa illeana douglas 1995s to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films,positive
funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about toms visions of the girl she remarks i wouldnt be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that shes dead gives one pause,positive
also of note are jenny morrison 1994s intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in 1998s whatever as morrisons grieving teenage sister debbie,positive
if the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it doesnt what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty,positive
the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the offkilter frameofmind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realisticallywritten characters,positive
stir of echoes isnt as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be,positive
both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is a spinetinglingly good horror film,positive
all those who were offended by theres something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch,positive
and while this uproariously funny grossout summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end,positive
american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenagetargeted fare this season,positive
i must question the studio that releases a movie like this,positive
the producers are aiming these films at the 1524 crowd but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an rrated film,positive
some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc17 a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie,positive
american pie was threatened with an nc17 but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product it was given an r but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park,positive
it is sick perverse and ultimately disgusting not to mention extremely funny,positive
american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night,positive
jim jason biggs kevin thomas ian nicholas oz chris klein and finch eddie kaye thomas are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead,positive
jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base to which one of his friends replies like warm apple pie,positive
of course this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner,positive
there are many moments such as this in which director paul weitz uses a gameplan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief,positive
american pie is a hardfought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it,positive
i loved the young cast in this movie,positive
consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects and you should appreciate their performances,positive
biggs is more than enjoyable and chris klein who recently played a similar jock in election is obviously a young talent on the rise,positive
but in a teendominated movie the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy of televisions sctv who is unexpectedly brilliant as jims uneasy father,positive
scenes in which the familiar fatherson conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie,positive
after levy discovers jims new use for apple pie he tells him i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age,positive
but i never used baked goods,positive
it is performances such as his and bill murrays in rushmore that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out,positive
there are some lessthanoriginal aspects of the film,positive
a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of exlax is something weve seen before,positive
if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers then this is a decidedly unwise move the same prank was pulled in the brothers dumb and dumber and used to greater effect,positive
secondly the characters are forced into a halfhearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing,positive
but at one point in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of its own biggs asks his buddies why hes going through so much pressure for something thats not very important anyway,positive
and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate it still manages to be mature,positive
in its own way,positive
when 17 year old beau hall jonathan tucker the virgin suicides gets in a car accident after drinking with his 30 year old companion club owner darby reese josh lucas session 9 his mom margaret tilda swinton the war zone pays reese a visit to convince him to leave her son alone,positive
instead reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese,positive
the next morning margaret discovers darbys dead body on their beach and suspecting the worst weights it down in a distant part of the lake,positive
but her troubles are just beginning as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer alek spera goran visnjic practical magic in the deep end,positive
the incredibly pale redheaded scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american supermom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and livein fatherinlaw jack peter donat the game,positive
she shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco named the deep end near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated,positive
gradually her loneliness becomes apparent her husbands a naval officer usually away at sea when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later when a most unusual yet chaste romance turns tragic,positive
its a terrific performance,positive
the stendahl syndromelike script adapted from elisabeth sanxay holdings 40s noir novel the blank wall by directors scott mcgehee and david siegel would be unbelievable if not for swinton and her costar visnjic,positive
alek spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after reeses body has been discovered,positive
he shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese and demands 50 000 or hell turn the tape over to the reno police,positive
subsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards though as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail,positive
theres yet another problem though his partner nagle raymond barry dead man walking is a harder cored criminal who wont let up until his share of the money is delivered,positive
visnjics dark brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us believe hes a victim of circumstance and environment,positive
his turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margarets inherent decency and her workaday surroundings,positive
also outstanding is tucker as beau who has a terrific character arc and pas de deux with his mother,positive
initially beaus the typical sullen teen,positive
youre blowing this out of proportion he says of her concerns about reese not comprehending that his mom has enough insight to have divined the true nature of the relationship,positive
as his mom gets in deeper and deeper trying to cover up a crime he didnt commit beau becomes suspicious of her actions and apparent new companion turning tables,positive
his early black eye becomes her later split lip,positive
while the two can never be completely honest with each other their love for each other comes through strongly,positive
the directors suture have a firm grip on their material and cast,positive
the story builds perfectly with bold strokes amidst a myriad of subtler underpinnings,positive
water imagery is constant an early shot of weirdly rushing green is revealed to be a young boy cleaning out an aquarium,positive
giles nuttgens fire cinematography which won the 2001 sundance festival award is crisp and startlingly clear,positive
the tahoe locations and production design by kelly mcgehee and christopher tandon provide a dual personality for the film contrasting the calm well off existence of the lake against the gambling city of reno,positive
the deep end is a complex story of domino deeds and shifting relationships,positive
take the plunge,positive
steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back he spent this time writing essays and short stories for the new yorker several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation pure drivel 1998,positive
much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview in a fine chapter called in search of the wily filipino,positive
now as writer and star of bowfinger he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema perhaps finally venting the frustrations everything being made now is crap that led to his brief retirement from hollywood,positive
martin stars as bobby bowfinger a roger cormanwannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer quality of the projects be damned,positive
his accountant adam aleximalle proposes a movie called chubby rain about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops,positive
bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film based on the lie that americas top box office draw kit ramsey murphy has agreed to star,positive
ramsey of course wants nothing to do with such lowgrade material so bowfinger on the thinking that action stars need to run not speak decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously,positive
he sends his cast members who arent in on it either they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his costars to ramseys table at restaurants asks them to follow him in parking lots etc spouting script dialogue all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance,positive
the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time,positive
ramsey is a member of mind head a cultish selfhelp organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities,positive
as if thats not familiar enough mind head guru terry stricter terence stamp has been dressed and combed to resemble l ron hubbard founder of scientology,positive
when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble white code in his face they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat requiring bowfinger to find a standin,positive
murphy will probably win more fans as jiff ramseys adorable ignoramus double than as kit but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage,positive
always surrounded by an entourage suffering from a racial inferiority complex murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself,positive
furthermore consider the enemies hell make of popular scientologists,positive
pacing stricters neutralcoloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly,positive
murphys scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta clearing,positive
not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick bowfinger is steve martins invention,positive
his script is surprisingly clever as satire given that the pseudoreligion is a sitting duck as is the entire los angeles film industry,positive
the griffin milltypes take quite a beating in the form of robert downey jr as bigwig jerry renfro,positive
martins decision to tell the story from a bottom feeders point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovativenever have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture,positive
as expected there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs such as martins crew of mexican borderjumpers who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading cahiers du cinema or martins nonsensical explanation to dave his loyal cinematographer jamie kennedy that every movie in the end has a budget of twothousand dollars,positive
most of bowfinger is universally funny however i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski one of our brightest comediennes is on screen,positive
bowfingers main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath,positive
were also asked to believe that a few simple closeups of kit ramsey would redeem chubby rain zgrade entertainment that would make ed wood blush,positive
this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in ozs last directorial effort the poorly conceived in out,positive
these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece,positive
as i mentioned at the start of this review bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather grahams character daisy does hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom,positive
that said it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome,positive
martin gets sentimental by storys end as he did in l a story and how could he not,positive
for those who can hack it the movies might be the greatest business in the world,positive
seen july 8 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 albany ny theater 7 at 8 15 p m with my mom using hoyts cinema cash,positive
theater rating 12 very good sound picture and seats,positive
its very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life,positive
all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters lives but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do,positive
therefore gone with the wind deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does in such a crafted intricate and entertaining manner,positive
its a crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself,positive
the film takes place in georgia before during and after the civil war,positive
this plays a major factor in the films success,positive
to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy,positive
it might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers,positive
can a story set so long ago be relatable now,positive
the film confronts all these problems paradoxically by not cronfronting them,positive
it doesnt simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant,positive
building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media without which what is there to build on,positive
were given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters especially our main character scarlett ohara leigh a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel a cunning wit and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time,positive
she knows how her society works wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her,positive
right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be,positive
being the most soughtafter woman allows her to manipulate men and their women to ensure she gets her way whether it be obvious i e,positive
who will be the one to get her food or subtle i e,positive
getting married just to spite someone,positive
the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes howard a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him,positive
he isnt so arrogant and demanding as scarlett in fact hes engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his,positive
her name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable characters one will ever see,positive
she and scarlett become very dear friends but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her and the love she has for her husband,positive
her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but doesnt give her much emotional selfdefense,positive
acting a catalyst to the love triangle and to the story as a whole is the daper stongwilled cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable,positive
hes quite a character all right everyone listens to what he has to say even though hes got a bad reputation,positive
butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior,positive
he tells everyone the muchneeded truth in the rigid castelike society where freewill doesnt seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition,positive
for example in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners theres no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out,positive
this angers them not for his lack of faith but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that,positive
do we have ammunition factories,positive
do we have food,positive
do we have a navy,positive
all we have is tobacco,positive
all true statements and yet the south still insists hes wrong,positive
butler is a shifty character to be sure but he takes such pride in his arrogance its appealing,positive
scarlett notices this too when she first sees him and from the look butler gives her we know hes not going to stop until he has her,positive
but scarlett cant get past her need for ashley and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever,positive
and so the story goes on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life,positive
the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dies,positive
this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story,positive
some are vital for only a few scenes but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film,positive
in most films only a few characters exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance,positive
even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set,positive
the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place,positive
the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these types of simple approaches are never taken,positive
the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war,positive
fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is,positive
one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming no,positive
not my leg,positive
dont cut off my leg,positive
another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street but as the camera pulls back we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers but it is their moaning thats more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be,positive
as the second half begins the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who singlehandedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north,positive
she manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she has cant help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the souths ultimate defeat,positive
this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship,positive
most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett,positive
each uses the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other,positive
scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett cant help but want her more every time she tries to oneup him such as marrying another man and taking over his business,positive
they say opposites attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities it borders on magnetic polarization,positive
they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together,positive
perhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaves it up to us to make this call,positive
both have things the other wants and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other,positive
love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film were left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why,positive
gable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture,positive
all,positive
none,positive
either way is possible and its a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings,positive
its safe to say most of us wont live such overly dramatic lives as those in gone with the wind but its still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that weve just experienced a lifes worth of joy and pain,positive
synopsis rumored to be about a true person the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years and has inspired operas literature and even coinage,positive
since 1984 china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures the 1992 set includes mulan,positive
in the ballad of mulan written in the 5th or 6th century an imperial edict by the khan emperor orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china,positive
a girls parents hear sighing and think that their daughter mulan the name means magnolia is dreaming of boys but actually shes dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle,positive
mulan bravely runs away masquerading as a boy to serve in the army instead of her father,positive
ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later the army finally returns in triumph,positive
the emperor wants to reward mulans valor with a prestigious position in government but she declines accepts a horse and returns home quietly to don her true clothes,positive
mulans old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman,positive
the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story only it adds a modern character for comic relief mushu the dragon eddie murphy,positive
in disneys mulan when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army,positive
old mr fa soontek oh is handicapped and has no son he has only his spirited young daughter mulan mingna wen,positive
fearing for her fathers life the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair disguises herself as a man and sneaks off to serve in the army in her fathers stead,positive
meanwhile mushu the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner,positive
his only duty is to ring a gong,positive
mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero,positive
with the help of mushu a horse and a lucky cricket can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family,positive
opinion east meets west,positive
i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors,positive
from their state of the art animation studio in orlando disney is hoping to work the same kind of magic with mulan,positive
i mean what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art with donny osmond singing mingna wen acting and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson,positive
yet this is the case in the disneys reinterpretation of the familiar chinese classic,positive
the end result is spectacular mulan is one of disneys best movies ever,positive
personally im also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weakwilled subservient asian woman take a beating mulan is portrayed as a normal if spirited compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative,positive
mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney,positive
kids of any age will like the family themes and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing,positive
and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor while the boys admire the battles,positive
and adults can admire those nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family honor and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love gumption and questioning,positive
but even the tiniest details reveal quality,positive
the movies art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look negative spaces positive detail period clothing and graphic designs typical of the time and place,positive
computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 000 people and a special program called attila was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback,positive
and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game,positive
balance is crucial,positive
a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disneys cup of tea but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine then pow,positive
the dream team,positive
by the same token a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself but toss the dragon in there and youve got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp,positive
its rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west old and young male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole but mulan hits the universal bullseye,positive
its movie for any age creed gender or color,positive
when i first heard that disneys next animated feature was going to be tarzan i was almost horrified,positive
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules sorry jerkules,positive
that effort was too overloaded with comedy and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero and after viewing it to this day i find it a disgrace for disney animation,positive
when i saw the trailers i was thinking hmm,positive
this isnt bad at all,positive
this just might have potential,positive
when i bought the soundtrack i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features,positive
i have never really heard of phil collins nor have i heard of mark mancina so i was wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin,positive
i was pleasantly surprised the music is topnotch,positive
phil collins songs are terrific percussionheavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs,positive
the score from mark mancina was also neat it reminded me a bit of the lion king but it was more original,positive
so the soundtrack wasnt bad at all considering it was by two people i am not familiar with,positive
this film could be good,positive
but will it be,positive
when i finally went to see it on opening day as i tend to do with most disney animated features my question was answered in a complete turnabout of expectations for me disneys tarzan is surprisingly decent,positive
the story starts out with tarzans parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace,positive
however one day a vicious leopard sabor attacks and kills tarzans parents leaving him at this time a baby aloneuntil kala of the apes rescues him,positive
kala wants to raise the child as her own she lost hers previously to sabor but her mate kerchak is not too sure,positive
its not our kind he says,positive
he agrees though to let her take care of little tarzan but that doesnt make him my son,positive
tarzan grows up vowing to be the best ape ever but no matter how hard he tries or what he does at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend terk he just cant convince kerchak that he is one of the apes even when he defeats sabor in a battle,positive
one day a new animal shows up humans,positive
this is where jane comes into the picture,positive
she is on an expedition with her father professor porter and a despicable hunter clayton searching for gorillas,positive
tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons and soon they get to know each other,positive
even though tarzan falls in love with jane this causes things to go wrong,positive
clayton tricks tarzan into taking him jane and porter to see the apes who are convinced that he has betrayed them,positive
worse clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money,positive
will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes,positive
im not gonna tell you sorry,positive
youre gonna have to see for yourself,positive
and see it you should the animation is as always top notch particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees read that skateboarding,positive
the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in,positive
in fact it seems similar to the computer animation combination in rival disney animted films such as foxs anastasia and dreamworks prince of egypt,positive
could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals,positive
the casting is fairly good,positive
tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan and to my relief the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules,positive
nicely done and glenn close is wonderful as kala she has a beautiful singing voice too by the way,positive
lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby bensons beast voice which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping,positive
minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane,positive
i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film when i first saw the trailers but when i saw the film i didnt have a problem with her,positive
i take back my insult on driver,positive
its nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature he was fflewdurr flamm in disneys most underrated classic the black cauldron he is funny and delightful as professor porter,positive
on the villiany side of the voices brian blessed the guy who did boss nass in star wars episode ithe phantom menace brings a pompous and later on vicious voice to the sinister clayton,positive
he might not be the strongest character in the film hes just a plain bad guy nothing else but blesseds vocal work contributes greatly,positive
but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show it should be rosie odonnell who is hilariously funny as terk,positive
she also has a fiesty attitude im gonna kill ya,positive
she says more than once,positive
i almost sung along with her during one of the films best moments where the apes make a mess of the humans camp via song er scatting shoobedoo dabedah,positive
i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film shes a good singer,positive
not that she was the only funny character in the film though,positive
wayne knight who played stan in space jam gives a whimsically funny style to tantor an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into unsanitary water,positive
thankfully there is no real sound of flatuencethat would have killed the picture,positive
the songs as i said before are decent mostly sung by collins,positive
this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time the characters do not sing,positive
i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would but i found this to be a nice change of pace,positive
the story does have elements of comedy in it but they also load it with strong dramatic touches which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules,positive
if there is anything disappointing about tarzan it might be the omission of the n sync version of trashing the camp from the film,positive
i heard it on the soundtrack and wondered where it was going to be,positive
i was upset that it wasnt because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like n sync to see tarzan,positive
oh well,positive
overall i was enthralled with tarzan,positive
i wouldnt hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame my alltime favorite disney classics but this film deserves a high place among disneys greatest achievements,positive
i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular masterpiece mulan with this great animated adaption of egar rice burroughs tarzan,positive
steven spielbergs amistad which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who owned them is concerned with several different aspects of this story,positive
first the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery,positive
second it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins,positive
last and most importantly it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade,positive
amistad succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements,positive
i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another antislavery movie,positive
having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery i doubted that there was much i didnt already know about it,positive
fortunately i turned out to be wrong,positive
for one thing spielbergs camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders operations in africa so amistad was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning,positive
and some of the images here are in fact much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery,positive
one scene in the middle in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their excess slaves by throwing them overboard to drown has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year,positive
spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc17 rating,positive
the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time,positive
exposing politicians as narrowminded opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff of course but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation,positive
the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time such that john quincy adams and probably other politicians like him who clearly disapproved of the practice was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court,positive
the biggest success of amistad is probably the characterization of cinque djimon hounsou who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin matthew mcconaughey the lawyer who represents them in court,positive
through cinque we are given a window into the native culture as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ,positive
cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that again contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles,positive
what kind of country is this where laws almost work he asks baldwin in bewilderment when he learns that the case must be retried before the supreme court,positive
spielbergs direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinques angry outburst in the court room,positive
still there isnt enough of this for it to be a serious problem,positive
the main flaw in this film which prevents it from earning four stars is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni cant quite handle all of these issues at the same time so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie,positive
this summers contact for example dealt with several issues at once but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and most importantly all of them were resolved at once,positive
amistad tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams but it somehow feels a little forced and in any case the speech itself which lasts almost fifteen minutes wears out its welcome about halfway through,positive
perhaps the best way to describe it is this amistad is three four star films edited into one,positive
almost every individual scene works but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence and thus is less than the sum of its parts,positive
however i cant honestly say how it could have been done differently and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery,positive
some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies,positive
that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find to their big surprise that the majority of people vote republican go to church every sunday and usually dont tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film,positive
such rude awakening however can happen in another direction conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in,positive
something like that happens to jake van dorn george c scott successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community,positive
one day his daughter kristen ilah davis disappears from calvinist youth convention in california,positive
van dorn is worried because he doesnt believe that his daughter would run from home,positive
however the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast peter boyle is even harder kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film,positive
infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way masts investigation is going so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself,positive
unfortunately he lacks experience and the quest that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld is fruitless,positive
things change when he devises cunning plan and while doing it stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky season hubley,positive
almost two decades after its release hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars,positive
it is a real shame because very few movies in todays hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt,positive
in late 1970s it was totally different situation films were expected to have mature serious themes for the mature audience,positive
for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work taxi driver one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s,positive
on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great,positive
but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and instead of facing them prefers to live in rural conservative cocoons,positive
the new america on the other hand fares no better ideals of the socalled sexual revolution same as all other revolutions of the swinging sixties degraded into exploitation and depravity,positive
instead of being liberated baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms,positive
schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas actually arent so far away nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist meets sleazy porno producer the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian paternalistic and very dedicated to this job,positive
the difference between the two is simply in the line of work,positive
many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda,positive
on the surface it may look that way audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest,positive
in the first scenes he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesnt deserve to experience parents worst nightmare,positive
the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristens fate is extremely cruel pain and humiliation brought by oscarwinning actor george c scott is of such intensity that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda,positive
van dorn is perhaps flawed and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end but the viewers simply know that his cause is just and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body,positive
on the other hand schrader who grew up in an environment very much like van dorns his own parents wouldnt allow him to watch movies until he was 18 knows better and tries to bring another side of coin,positive
even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities like nicky who actually tries to improve her life and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end,positive
unfortunately schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich d finale,positive
the script is slightly flawed and schrader as director doesnt show too much originality his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver,positive
apart from the scenes in grand rapids those two films even look alike,positive
but the content might be more than interesting for todays viewer especially those inspired by the current 70s revival,positive
until boogie nights no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s,positive
hardcore on the other hand might serve as precious document because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs before the advent of video when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists,positive
the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering though but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience that shouldnt be too surprising,positive
anyway despite some flaws hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema,positive
theres something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days,positive
stiller currently has three projects in circulation and what other actor can lay claim to that,positive
hes in theres something about mary which i still havent seen,positive
and hes in the acerbic your friends neighbors playing a talkative sexuallyfrustrated drama coach called jerri,positive
now theres permanent midnight in which stiller plays another jerry this one a heroinaddicted television writer last name stahl,positive
theres also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drugaddiction pictures the minute theyve proved themselves commercially,positive
ewan mcgregor springs to mind who after successful turns in emma and brassed off received greater respect and admiration for his mindblowing realization as renton in danny boyles transatlantic junkfest trainspotting,positive
the philosophy appears to be a simple one if you want em to be taken seriously make em do drugs,positive
permanent midnight is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl a successful hollywood writer who in the mideighties had a 5 000aweek job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a 6 000aweek heroin habit,positive
a habit in stahls own words the size of utah,positive
as stahl stiller contributes a commanding performance,positive
unlike trainspotting which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse permanent midnight instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance,positive
one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to naked lunch author william s burroughs who when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds so i can shave,positive
stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in permanent midnight its so he can talk to his mother on the phone show up for work on time even pay his bills,positive
while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl the writing adapted from stahls autobiography by director david veloz is controlled and pointed,positive
permanent midnight shows how stahl moved from new york to l a toagain in the authors words escape the drug scene yeah right why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec elizabeth hurley so impossibly polite youd swear her single profanity was dubbed and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings,positive
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty norristowns own maria bello with whom he spent some rehab time,positive
janeane garofalo is wastedand miscastas a heavilybespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the dopedup wordsmith and thats stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor,positive
stiller unshaven burroughs take note and with lots of mascara around the eyes has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but to his credit never once pushes his pillpopping needlejabbing performance over the top,positive
the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see permanent midnight a dark comic and strangely absorbing study of assisted living,positive
the premise is simple if not bizarre,positive
a mad scientist trace beaulieu as dr clayton forrester launches an averagejoe michael j nelson as mike nelson into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made,positive
why,positive
its torturous its maniacal and its just plain fun,positive
based on the cultfavorite cable television series mystery science theater 3000 the movie isnt torturous but as for being maniacal and just plain fun it foots the bill quite nicely,positive
mike nelson on a dogbone shaped spacecraft spends his days as any young man would dream indulging in sarcasm and horseplay and seeing quite a few movies,positive
the catch is these movies arent the movies he chooses but retched examples of filmmaking chosen specifically by dr forrester in an attempt to break mikes will to live,positive
dr forrester is convinced that one too many b movies is all it will take to ruin a man but with a couple of wisecracking puppet buddies tom servo voiced by kevin murphy and crow t robot voiced by beaulieu the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema,positive
the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known even if by very few of us to man,positive
we watch as the silhouettes of mike tom and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them,positive
in this case its the 1954 scifi film this island earth,positive
we basically watch as our three leads watch only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary,positive
the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant but for the sake of those who might want to know ill explain this one,positive
this island earth is the tale of two scientists a man and a woman who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth,positive
together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet,positive
to make mst3k work the filmwithinthefilm naturally has to be as horrible as possible and although the tvseries introduced us to several worse films than this island earth its a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty,positive
mst3k which doesnt actually contain the complete this island earth is a short 73 minutes but this is a step very wisely taken,positive
as funny as some of their observations are it can only go so long,positive
occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously,positive
although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment its better than overkilling the whole concept post haste,positive
mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly but if you dont know what youre in for it could be a jarring disappointment,positive
although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars it is a movie to be seen on home video late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway and with a large saracastic crowd new years at midnight for example which is when i saw it,positive
warning although mst3k has more to its end credits than most the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun they are actually more annoying than most,positive
the name slandering and asinine oneliners were extremely unfunny and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight it put a heavy damper on the overall experience,positive
most people will likely stay to see what the smartalecs have to say but for me it almost ruined an otherwise good film,positive
let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal,positive
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal,positive
i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times,positive
under no circumstances should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix,positive
this theater owned by the parent company of one of hollywoods biggest studios hasnt even graduated into stereo sound yet,positive
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age,positive
in other words the sound sucked,positive
as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater bad sound doesnt do anything to add to a film,positive
im not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together,positive
there ive had my rant now on with the regularly scheduled review,positive
which sadly wont include commentary on the films sound which im assuming was spectacular but im just guessing,positive
my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix,positive
it is nothing short of stunning visually,positive
sadly the rest of the film while pretty good doesnt quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good,positive
the matrix has at its core a good concept although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked,positive
keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax,positive
it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster,positive
now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator plugged into a computer network,positive
the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed,positive
the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose,positive
that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons,positive
they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie,positive
reeves character neo is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus laurence fishburne,positive
newcomer carrieanne moss and one of hollywoods most underrated actors joe pantoliano join fishburne in the band of freedomfighters,positive
the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular,positive
this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actors extensive preproduction training in martial arts,positive
this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film,positive
when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world it all adds up to an eyeful,positive
as i already said the visuals far outpace the rest of the film,positive
acting in the matrix is not bad but it certainly isnt real good either,positive
keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances,positive
although to his credit it is one of his better performances,positive
laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a scifi action film,positive
more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama,positive
joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had,positive
carrieanne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role,positive
its nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks,positive
you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film,positive
it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences,positive
i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue which was terrible at times,positive
in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird,positive
it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie,positive
so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about,positive
thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability,positive
my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending,positive
the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before,positive
the ending itself was just plain strange,positive
the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch,positive
while the rest of the film acting dialogue and to a degree plot detract from the high production values they dont detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening,positive
the happy bastards quick movie review,positive
me tarzan you,positive
happy viewer,positive
for a minute there i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disneys latest another adaptation of a legend from the past,positive
remember the pathetic pocahontas,positive
yikes,positive
but guess what disney a company thats been on a roll lately with animated films strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you,positive
the story is pretty basic tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla whos lost her young adopts him into her group,positive
as he matures into a much older man tarzan still wonders just why hes so much different from the clan and then arrives a hunter a professor and the professors lovely daughter jane who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons,positive
from there tarzan faces tough choices should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england,positive
the voicework here is pretty toplevel,positive
tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the alreadybeautiful jane nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice rosie o donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzans best ape friend terk and wayne newman knight has his moments as a panicky elephant,positive
the movie is superb throughout mixing a great script with incredible computerassisted visuals,positive
when tarzan treesurfs a twist that was added on top of the same ol vine swinging and a great one i might add the camera twists and turns allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly,positive
i couldnt believe my eyes disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast,positive
and the musics not half bad either,positive
fortunately theres no ridiculous singing characters here just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood,positive
theres some great action sequences here as well including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan jane and the aforementioned babboons,positive
but of course its not all action theres a message here as well that has to do with family,positive
this is easily one of disneys best animated films of the decade and its one i cant wait to put in my home library that,positive
is if my vcr still works in the year 2000,positive
im not quite sure how best to go about writing this review,positive
i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinsons political satire wag the dog but in retrospect this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it,positive
quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through and it didnt do that,positive
they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and alltootrue attack on the way the american political media works and it didnt quite do that either,positive
a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubricks dr,positive
strangelove in the tradition of political black comedy and it most definitely didnt do that,positive
that said wag the dog is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them,positive
the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean robert deniro to distract the american public from the accusations that the president who is up for reelection in two weeks sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office,positive
the accusations the script suggests are probably untrue but as brean so pointedly puts it that isnt particularly relevant the scandal is likely to derail the presidents campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood,positive
brean along with his assistant anne heche decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and specialeffects trickery to make it appear that the u s is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor,positive
as i said wag the dog is not quite as laughoutloud hilarious as i had expected but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here such as when in an echo of a familiar movie clich the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting inspirational music then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform we have the right to fight for democracy,positive
another scene shows us how with modern editing equipment an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village,positive
the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda teams attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt,positive
william old shoe schumann woody harrelson an exmilitary officer who turns out to be a firstclass psycho,positive
of course not everything goes as planned the cia for example realizes whats going on and strikes a deal with the presidents electoral opponent to report to the media that the fighting has ended forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis,positive
still even with the cias involvement the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable,positive
regardless of the official word from the president or the cia wouldnt the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is in fact no fighting going on in albania,positive
the film never addresses this question nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt,positive
schumann we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it,positive
there was also an instance towards the end of the film in which one of motsss forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away,positive
with these plot holes wag the dog doesnt quite work as a satire of american politics but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place,positive
brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical rather they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off,positive
the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret,positive
motss and his hollywood buddies meanwhile seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project,positive
in fact one of the sources of conflict in the film is motsss increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war in his mind it is the greatest work of art he has ever created,positive
i think its fair to say that wag the dog underachieves a little bit more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a fourstar film and a classic satire,positive
still the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one,positive
wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks what if the war wasnt even real,positive
with this premise and the talented cast the film still delivers more consistently than most whatever its flaws,positive
i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so liveactiondisney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins separated at birth by divorcing parents never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again,positive
and everyone should know how i feel about remakes especially of films i happen to enjoy my fallacy unless youre going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with a gasp new idea,positive
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list and was actually quite the opposite,positive
contemporary liveactiondisney films are not one of my favorties anyway theyre usually unfunny alienating and a big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10,positive
this one however is shockingly not bad,positive
in fact its actually good,positive
not the original good but whats great about it is that it doesnt necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining,positive
because its cute and innocent fun,positive
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with,positive
because the lead star is immensely appealing,positive
because the parents are also immensely appealing,positive
and im repeating myself because its cute and innocent fun,positive
theres nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and its aimed directly at either kids adults who want to remember the original or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid,positive
i personally am somewhere between the second and third,positive
i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasnt so weird or diverse the names godard and kubrick werent even a glimmer in my right eye back then when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abcs wonderful world of disney where theyd show you a liveaction madefortv disney flick an hour per week,positive
i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films like lady and the tramp and pinnochio,positive
and most sadly i remember every single christmas without fail there were a barage of childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively for the christmas season that i wouldnt dare missing,positive
i can even remember seeing the madefortv parent trap ii on tv one night and after i had seen that one over and over and over again i saw the original parent trap,positive
its more of a late childhood movie because it deals with the issue of divorce but it deals with it in a disneyized version,positive
its playful and witty and charming and if i saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood id probably dismiss it,positive
id probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadnt seen the original at such a perfect age,positive
watching it i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seeminglyperfect parents splitting up and how it affected my adolescence,positive
and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fuckedup of situations things could always work out if you well manipulate things a bit at least for the better,positive
this new version did that for me but its also charming in its own way,positive
it has a new cast a contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for a liveactiondisney flick a tone that isnt corny or condescending but just right,positive
the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way,positive
and for the first time since the original film the kids actually know better than the foolish adults,positive
the story is basically classic by now repeated almost as many times as kurosawas the seven samurai a pair of twins played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mills in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parents,positive
one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than i had ever noticed in london where she lives with her parents and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz as she works as a swingin fashion designer,positive
she grows up refined and classy but also with a keen knowledge in sports and pokerplaying,positive
the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on a vineyard with their pseudomaid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming,positive
they both meet at the same camp one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged,positive
they feud because they look alltoo similar and are thus in tight competition which results in some nasty pranks which winds them in seclusion together in a private outoftheway cabin,positive
there they become friends then learn about eachother,positive
once they know everything they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent whom theyve only heard of,positive
they learn about eachothers lives in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously earpiercing a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer comes they switch and hope for the best,positive
lindsay lohan doesnt necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original,positive
but she comes off just as appealing as she did once,positive
she does though add a couple new things she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively,positive
she also adds on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake ones accents arent exactly perfect,positive
shes also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actors are especially in their first films,positive
she makes a great protagonist and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing,positive
dennis quaid in fact hasnt been this likable in about a decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past not just that hes mr meg ryan,positive
ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasnt ever been this likable period,positive
the two make a winning couple maybe not so winning as maureen ohara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film,positive
instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original during the opening credits we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the films more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraineinducing way as in many such films,positive
this all brings this new parent trap to a level of entertainment that hasnt really existed since well the original film years ago still my money the best liveactiondisney flick of all time,positive
this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot a golddigging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix whos deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film a treat instead of a bore,positive
like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it takes two starring the olsen twins because it treats the children as the smart ones and the adults as the silly ones not the other way around,positive
and because above everything it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew,positive
however in comparison with the original it could be a bit better,positive
certain scenes work well but not nearly as well as they worked in the original,positive
i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing a lesson extracted from the howard grant films of yesteryear,positive
and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom,positive
the original though not gritty was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences,positive
as such this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances,positive
im an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously a tad biased at least i admitted it,positive
of course that doesnt mean that im gonna be giving this a fourstar review or something because alien resurrection the fourth film in the coolashell series is not an absolutely amazing film much like the first two were,positive
however its a very good film which never fails to entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series,positive
in short i had a good time,positive
alien resurrection leaves off 200 years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genres answer to job had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one,positive
of course the last one wasnt very great or anything i liked it though not as much as the first two and more importantly it wasnt financially successful a tawdry 55 million bucks,positive
so back we are with ripley back as a clone which means we get another little satirical look at cloning not that thats a bad thing but its becoming a cliche,positive
so shes cloned aboard an even more futuristiclooking ship called the auriga by some doctors including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played by j e freeman as well as the littleseen dr gediman played by none other than brad douriff mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her,positive
once you get past the fact that you cant figure out where they got her blood although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one the films okay,positive
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon a jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out to have a bit of a secret i wont state it but unless youve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years you probably know all about it although its nicely covered up,positive
theres a bit of a nonsexualyetslightlyhomoerotic relationship between her and ripley but its never really deepened enough,positive
oh well,positive
well as you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship,positive
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance whos death is comical yet sad since well hes dan hedaya and the remaining people about 7 or 8 are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth,positive
of course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun,positive
the real focus of the series seems to be on style not really substance although theres always a bit of it most notably in aliens with the relationship between ripley and the little girl,positive
whats interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach,positive
alien is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights,positive
aliens is a wild tense thriller,positive
alien 3 is a bleak moody piece of seminoir,positive
alien 4 is kind of like an offbeat french film filled with lots of humor and cool scares,positive
jeanpierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like das boot has with echoes hinting at a possible threat,positive
the chills in the film are really cool especially with the music which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes theres the most tense surgery scene since towards the beginning,positive
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that,positive
this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others,positive
there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed,positive
one is the aforementioned surgery scene,positive
another one takes place between call and ripley which is just awesome,positive
the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jawdropping scenes in the entire saga with a small allusion to jeunets earlier film delicatessen,positive
and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool with a lovely allusion to goldfinger,positive
but the best scene in the entire film im sure im not the first to mention it takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her she has a an 8 tatooed on her arm,positive
it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga,positive
the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work as it never really deapens a lot of the characters,positive
however it does make us care about most of them so that when theres very little of them and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared,positive
and yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who do i have to fuck to get off this boat,positive
johner well i can get you off,positive
but not this ship,positive
the acting is good all around with standout performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in se7en who performed the lust sin as an anxietyridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him,positive
winona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she meshes well with the film,positive
of course and as usual sigourney weaver steals the show,positive
playing a variation on the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable,positive
shes not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for aliens but shes just awesome,positive
overall its a thrilling entertaining film which doesnt really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment,positive
the style is the best part of the film which isnt really a bad thing but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply,positive
but its entertaining as hell and its definitely fit for the alien series,positive
playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeares works,positive
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare i mean really who doesnt think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter,positive
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare,positive
and despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded,positive
shakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year,positive
its so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have a movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written,positive
it could have been a smug selfimportant movie that panders to diehard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this film is almost universal if youve ever read a play by shakespeare or know anything about his life its likely that youll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love,positive
joseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself hes a delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from lifes more serious problems debt plague etc,positive
hes commissioned to write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann tom wilkinson,positive
shakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work,positive
he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel,positive
this all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps a radiant gwyneth paltrow a young heiress set to marry the financiallyoriented lord wessex colin firth,positive
shakespeare instantly falls in love with her he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo,positive
he discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love with him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex,positive
but she continues to act because she loves shakespeares writing so much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet is set to be performed,positive
shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter,positive
i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy hes clearly a man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability to turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense a great deal of affection and care,positive
he practically overflows with passion in every scene,positive
fiennes is matched by paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance ive seen her in,positive
the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh,positive
of course it doesnt hurt that they have a masterful script to work with,positive
stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor,positive
the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet,positive
one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid,positive
director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director,positive
im going to have to see the movie again im certain there are numerous references that i missed,positive
in fact i doubt its possible to gather everything with just one viewing,positive
stoppard is a master of detail youll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not as lines of a play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time,positive
theres also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played by the openlyhomosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowes mysterious death in a pub,positive
theres also a scene featuring a wideeyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing,positive
theres no dog in this play,positive
no,positive
no dog,positive
the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year,positive
geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard to recognize but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously,positive
ben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrows and in humor he has some of the best oneliners in the movie,positive
colin firth always stuck playing the sap does a good job being hateful,positive
judi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words,positive
my single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end,positive
the story is moving but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes,positive
but my quibbling is not important,positive
what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill with which it has been written acted and produced,positive
shakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them its a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him a film in which the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync,positive
its also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeares work in a positive way without seeming condescending or superior,positive
i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them,positive
not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it,positive
the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas has made the film out to be a comedy and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one,positive
its 1971 and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few washouts among them journalist raoul duke johnny depp and his attorney dr gonzo benito del toro,positive
these two spend most of the film in a druginduced stupor having strange hallucinations trashing their hotel rooms and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path,positive
duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas but gets lost in a blur of drugs beer and flying dust and ends up wandering around with no clue who won,positive
he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate to cover a drug enforcement conference,positive
fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs,positive
it doesnt even in the beginningwhile the pairs antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first the humor here is still fairly dark,positive
director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye and even when were laughing were laughing at them rather than with them,positive
they spend most of their time paranoid angry or just plain befuddled which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles,positive
the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen but its probably not something most other audience members would want to experience firsthand,positive
all this aside i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its onehour mark thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an offkilter satire of drug culture,positive
thankfully the script delivers it before too long as duke in a rare moment of lucidity stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie riding the wave of something that seemed special and important,positive
now its six years later and the wave has finally broken as he puts it,positive
materialistic culture is still alive and well and for most of this film right in his face in las vegas the american dream of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever,positive
the social protesters have lost and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment,positive
in many ways fear and loathing is gilliams most realitybased film all of his others with the exception of the fisher king have made use of some sort of fantasy or sciencefiction plot elements,positive
yet it is his offthewall masterpiece brazil to which this film bears the most visual resemblance,positive
the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks and similarly dukes world is composed of the artificial empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations,positive
unlike the protagonist of brazil however duke is not a particularly admirable figure and neither is gonzo,positive
during the latter half of the film their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress while duke though he doesnt seem to approve doesnt do anything to stop it either,positive
by the time this scene takes place they dont seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner,positive
duke seems to realize at some level that hes become something he doesnt like but hes either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change,positive
this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience,positive
while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places i think he and his cowriters deserve more credit than that,positive
theres plenty of substance here particularly in the second half its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the 60s and the objects of their rebellion just arent usually very pleasant,positive
unlike say brazil or the fisher king both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment fear and loathing in las vegas shows us someone whos given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs,positive
in its own psychedelic whackedout way its sad and regretful but i think its also a bit of a kick in the pants a challenge to find an alternative between chemicallyinduced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegasstyle materialism,positive
indeed duke himself admits at one point that hes never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them,positive
im not sure if hes any closer to accepting it by the end or not but i suspect the audience will get the idea,positive
urban legend surprised me,positive
based on the last few films the genre has produced including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween h20 i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena,positive
thankfully legend rose above its soggy premise to become not only a hip scary and stylish entertainment but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year,positive
youre all familiar with the plot a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac whos identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be you guessed it everybodys favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks the,positive
only person you didnt suspect,positive
however just because legend doesnt really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it cant qualify as firstclass entertainment,positive
it was believe it or not one of the funnest times ive had at the movies all year,positive
the thing is im not really sure what made this particular stab pardon the pun at the genre seem so fresh and alive,positive
maybe it was the abovepar performances by the movies two leads jared leto and cybil actress alicia witt,positive
or it could have been the on target direction by jamie blanks,positive
more likely though it was because of the inspired premise,positive
i dont think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman,positive
urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film,positive
a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when gasp a gas problem heehee forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill,positive
one problem though,positive
would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif,positive
i thought not,positive
predictably the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company,positive
its odd though when you pick up a phone to realize that nobodys on the other line,positive
naturally the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off,positive
and the when we least expect it whack,positive
a decapitation,positive
it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car,positive
so who is it this time,positive
the obvious candidate is the slightly offkilter professor at the college the girl went to none other than freddy kruger himself robert englund who teaches a class on urban legends,positive
aha,positive
or could it be the famehungry local journalist leto looking for a meaty story to put on his resume,positive
like all movies of this nature one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit,positive
and it turns out to be of course the one you didnt suspect,positive
im not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is but i must give credit where credit is due,positive
and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been fun,positive
complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi ca,positive
expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a featurelength film and youve got babys day outan agreeably amusing childrens comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant,positive
the plot tracks a trio of crooksposedasphotographers mantegna pantoliano haley who steal ninemonthold bennington august cottwell iv aka baby bink from his oldmoney home,positive
but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago,positive
following the path of his favorite story called babys day out baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site,positive
while baby stays unscathed the crooks fare worse for the wear,positive
the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and of course suffer multiple crotch injuries,positive
john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one,positive
like he did in planes trains and automobiles john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple setup and extended execution,positive
here hes aided and abetted by a director patrick read johnson whose choreography could rival a coen brother,positive
best bit baby crawling across a busy city street,positive
babys day out has only two emotionsawww and ouchand the actors play them accordingly,positive
forget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon disposable as mom and nanny respectively the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing,positive
joe mantegna is a great head stooge barking lines like that little doodoo machine is my retirement money,positive
brian haley has a great scene with a gorilla while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegnas moe,positive
he is funny,positive
needless to say twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief,positive
nosferatu the vampyre germany 1979,positive
a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson,positive
this extraordinary retelling of bram stokers dracula by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore,positive
inspired by f w murnaus 1922 silent film of the same name herzogs film is a work of exquisite bleakness an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards,positive
the original fulllength english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u s distributor anchor bay entertainment and in gorgeous widescreen prints,positive
until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video and only in europe,positive
both of these rereleases restore the film to its full length but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue,positive
apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed,positive
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one,positive
everyone knows the story of dracula,positive
or do they,positive
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly wont hurt,positive
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count played by klaus kinski who wants to buy a house in harkers hometown,positive
upon seeing a photo of harkers wife the radiant isabelle adjani he instantly falls in love with her,positive
locking harker up in his castle he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him,positive
upon divining his identity as a vampire adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises,positive
that is a story familiar to millions but herzog has elevated stokers tale into the realm of and i use this term a tad reluctantly cinematic art,positive
nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film shot through blueish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised,positive
the films surreal dreamlike quality is utterly mesmerising,positive
there is much to enjoy but ill limit my praise to a few key points,positive
holding the film together is kinskis remarkable performance as count dracula,positive
past screen portrayals including bela lugosis famous turn have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp,positive
but kinski oh boy this is something far more compelling,positive
aided by a startling makeup job he portrays draculas vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease,positive
this man is dreadfully lonely,positive
he lives in utter solitude shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust,positive
kinskis portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting,positive
when he dies you almost feel as if this mans tortured soul has been freed at last,positive
then theres the unforgettable soundtrack largely composed by german group popul vuh,positive
it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that its quite impossible to imagine the film without it,positive
popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancientsounding kind of spacemusic using piano chants and exotic instruments,positive
when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums,positive
the one i still listen to the most is tantric songs from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken,positive
its a testament to the musics depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them,positive
the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies,positive
this is a timely rerelease by anchor bay,positive
after francis ford coppolas unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stokers tale in 1992 it is a joy to go back to herzogs film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a centuryold story,positive
to some aficionados nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made,positive
without a doubt it is an unmistakable classic of the genre,positive
dont miss it,positive
this remake of la cage aux folles features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their sons future inlaws,positive
the couple robin williams and nathan lane are about as archetypal or as the less kind might put it stereotypical gays possible,positive
williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star,positive
they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode,positive
williams is excellent as should be no surprise,positive
gene hackman as rightwing potential fatherinlaw is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles,positive
the real star is lane,positive
his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straightshooting uncle is hilarious,positive
perhaps it is a personal failing on my part but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it,positive
luckily for me at least it doesnt last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men their son and the deception,positive
the question of stereotypes is a touchy one,positive
these guys personify the homophobic gay image,positive
you can almost hear the swishing,positive
if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world youll be outraged,positive
but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals youll love it,positive
your choice,positive
review a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders,positive
living with his grandfather jehan jack warden in poverty nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times they are renting a spare oneroom cottage and the greedy malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them out of the house if they dont pay the rent,positive
nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen in either a movie or in real life,positive
his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the 17th century,positive
not that these are the only things that make nellos life happy however,positive
he has a dog of flanders whom he names patrasche who is a heroic rintintin of the 19th century whom he rescues from his cruel unkind master,positive
in addition he even has a best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with lowerclass nello,positive
he thinks hes not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying,positive
but then he was a poor guy himself before he married as mentioned later on in the film,positive
one day nello encounters a mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully by jon voight who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist,positive
and every christmas there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting a lot of money,positive
eager to save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides to become an artist asking aloise to pose for him,positive
one night the two travel to a circus where they have their fortune told one of the films most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them,positive
she gives the kids a ring whom nello places on aloises hand,positive
afterwards the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers,positive
unfortunately things are not all ladeedah in this tale,positive
aloises father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again,positive
bad enough that they cant see each other although we know nello and aloise dont we but thats only the start of nellos troubles,positive
aloises farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused by the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise,positive
this decreases nellos reputation around the town save aloise and her parents and a kindly miller william who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by,positive
matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies and he has to pay for his funeral,positive
but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly,positive
this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind,positive
worst of all the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time the portrait of the princess fails to win the prize at the festival,positive
now nello and patrasche are really depressed and close to freezing to death,positive
will nello be able to find any happiness in his life,positive
will patrasche save the day,positive
will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise,positive
a dog of flanders is a delightful heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages,positive
even older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grownups too,positive
there have been other movies of this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself,positive
move over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight,positive
the cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really adds to the powerful drama of the film,positive
it also gives a feel of being in flanders the whole film was respectably shot in flanders,positive
the music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century,positive
the opening song over the credits is very beautiful i hope the soundtrack is available and theres a brief excerpt of cheer up charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung by aloise to nello in another delightful scene,positive
the cast is firstrate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life so are the girls who play aloise madyline sweeten as the younger and farren monet as the older,positive
not that they are the only good stars however,positive
jack warden is ideal as jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character,positive
the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming touching ones,positive
also bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william,positive
hes another one of my favorite characters in the film,positive
but jon voight as i mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel,positive
he brings a mysterious yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest,positive
but what makes this film fun to watch is how welldefined the characters are and the pace of the story best of all it has a happy ending though i will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters,positive
for the first time since the beginning of 1999 there comes a film which doesnt rely on popular formula stuff such as bigbudget special effects commercial rock soundtracks or any of that stuff,positive
this one relies on telling a fully characteroriented story with just the right amount of heart humor and drama,positive
that to me is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful,positive
eleanor osullivan of the home news tribune noticed this and was kind and generous enough to welcome it for want of a better word a glow surrounds a dog of flanders,positive
its heart is in the right place and it engages you,positive
you can guess where the film is going because this is welltraveled territory but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner an oftentold story is well worth a revisit,positive
in addition there were a couple of other enthusiasts such as chicagosun times and the washington post you should read their reviews theyre really positive,positive
other critics however were not so kind,positive
stephen holden of the new york times had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing,positive
he found the film to be a sea of sugary bromides and condemned mr voights character as hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda,positive
in addition entertainment weekly slamdunked the film condemning it as the worst family film of the year,positive
there have been so many other bad reviews like this too,positive
my suggestion disregard the critics,positive
they just have a big problem with touching family films and one should never pay attention to them,positive
this dog of flanders may only be a little family movie it probably wont be a big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other film has been since then but that is not a bad thing in and of itself,positive
this is a story that is sure to warm your heart and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders,positive
it is also one of the better family films around this year,positive
none of the other films i have seen this year though they were good have been so lowkey and touching,positive
if youre looking for familystyle entertainment look no further than this charming boyanddog yarn,positive
go see it while you still can for as i mentioned it might not be a big bowwow at the box office for a long time,positive
see it while you can,positive
there is really no need to compare a multimillion dollar blockbuster such as star wars episode i the phantom menace or tarzan or even the iron giant with a tender sweet little family movie,positive
warning may contain some mild spoilers and offensive material,positive

a mild r rating,positive
starring rob schneider oded fehr eddie griffin arija bareikis amy poehler norm mcdonald,positive
running time 88 minutes,positive
deuce bigalow male gigolo is simply a hilarious goodnatured comedy that may offend some but underneath all its crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving,positive
it isnt any kind of cinematic classic but its a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too,positive
it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny the screenplay is witty and smart and the whole story is sweet and cute,positive
deuce bigalow rob schneider is your typically average guy he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it,positive
though one might call him a loser deuce gets a job he would never thought he would get,positive
he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo oded fehr and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip,positive
trying to be like him he hangs upside down from a pole and accidentally pushes off the fishtank and burns his cabinets,positive
the thing is now he has to try and find 6 000 dollars in three weeks to make sure everything looks right again,positive
so he decides to go manwhoring and to his luck gets the oddest people on earth an overweight woman who decidedly wants to eat everything in site a woman with narcolepsy who sleeps all the time a woman who has sudden screaming outbursts and a woman he cant stop thinking about,positive
he charges 10 but he is willing to negotiate,positive
from now on he is considered deuce bigalow male gigolo,positive
with nonstop laughs an a abundence of crude humor deuce bigalow male gigolo is sometimes like last years hit theres something about mary that is offensive but very funny,positive
the screenplay by harris goldberg and rob schneider himself is a smart clever and witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to make is so hilariously funny,positive
the characters in the film are all actually likable especially jabba lady with her big body but soft heart,positive
there are actually times in the movie where i fell out of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me,positive
even though i thought toy story 2 and being john malkovich were the funniest of the year deuce bigalow follows right behind them,positive
the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic and shows he took time on the film,positive
rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate arija bareikis it is a sweet romance that we get involved in and actually like being involved in it,positive
deuce bigalow is a goodnatured film worth all the merit it can get,positive
its not a classic or a masterpiece its just a comedy that we dont feel bad about watching,positive
sure it may come off as offensive and may come off as dumb sometimes but you cannot deny that it isnt funny,positive
deuce bigalow male gigolo is no disappointment,positive
its a fast paced entertaining sweet and hilarious comedy that may be destined to become a cult classic,positive
fans of schneider will not be disappointed and fans of crude but nice comedies will not either,positive
for some reason the film garnered an r rating but with no f words or extensive use of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why the film was r a mild r to put it to the least but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see,positive
dont try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they do not like it just sit back laugh and enjoy the movie,positive
the long kiss goodnight r meryl streep tried it and failed,positive
even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her wellbared assets,positive
however geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband renny harlin,positive
davis plays samantha caine a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years,positive
with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey samuel l jackson she slowly remembersand reclaimsher past as charly baltimore toughasnails cia operative,positive
needless to say with the reappearance of comes the appearance of an assortment of nogoodniks out to erase more than her memory,positive
shane black netted a cool 4 mil for his script im not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag but for what its worth it delivers the goods,positive
like blacks previous work such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny quirky dialogue,positive
the humor especially works well in this case for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously,positive
but theres no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car,positive
while ice skating,positive
jackson and davis make a good team,positive
jackson is funny as ever as ever in fact his spirited line deliveries especially when he first appears are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction,positive
as good as he is the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis who shows much promise as an action heroine,positive
what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesnt take herself too seriously,positive
she is obviously in on the joke slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation,positive
this is not to say that she doesnt need worksometimes she lays on the toughness a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature,positive
but should the public embrace the film and in turn the notion of a kickass female davis could have found her special niche,positive
it seems as if davis and harlins first collaboration the middling pirate epic cutthroat island was just a dress rehearsal albeit a very costly one for long kiss in which the wifehusband team hit their action stride,positive
anyone simply looking for a fun escapist entertainment that requires littletono thinking will find this film to be a morethanwelcome kiss,positive
many people dislike french films for their lack of closure,positive
while possibly shallow ive often had a desire for a sense of epiphany or at least a resolution in the films which i view,positive
there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional however the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passiondenying protagonist stephane daniel auteuil,positive
stephane daniel auteuil is a master violin maker,positive
he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing,positive
even the relationship between he and his boss maxime andre dussollier is a controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches,positive
in the beginning of the movie stephane is a closed solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man,positive
camille kessler emmanuelle beart is a master violinist and the new love of maximes,positive
maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife,positive
like stephane camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges,positive
when stephane and camille meet there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals,positive
however whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him,positive
stephane ignores his feelings for camille which the audience cannot help but to see is present,positive
as the movie progresses the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another,positive
these two people with very similar approaches to life initially react to their new circumstance very differently,positive
stephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship,positive
however their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation,positive
the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well due to his relationship with a master violin teacher,positive
however apparently he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing,positive
consequently stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays,positive
in contrast camille had almost given the violin years earlier,positive
however with the aid of her manager she has progressed to being almost one of the worlds finest successfully submerging herself to her playing,positive
during the course of the movie we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions,positive
stephane attempts to remain unchanged,positive
however we do see subtle hints of his transformation,positive
one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash,positive
the development of all of the characters many of which is not included in this synopsis is incredible,positive
american movies with rare exceptions have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development,positive
in its essence this movie is about the development and growth of the characters camille and stephane,positive
the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie including a death is to further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters,positive
i am not sure why berardinelli says at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified and it is to auteuils credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty,positive
this movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are,positive
i find the ending appropriate unfortunately i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling,positive
this portion of the film is where the sense of closure could have been successfully accomplished,positive
unfortunately there is a hurried and almost a soap operatype surge of emotions from all of the characters,positive
while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart ravel has his day in this film,positive
the synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen,positive
the directing in this movie is wonderful,positive
the actors and actresses are excellent each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth,positive
emmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful,positive
and needless to say i must say that emmanuelle beart herself is beautiful,positive
besides the near ending the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral,positive
i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of,positive
the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot has their attitude towards love changed,positive
i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at but i am unsure of which the director is espousing,positive
in summary this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship,positive
in the process we see their attitude towards life and other people,positive
in itself i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie,positive
where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we as americans have preconceived american notions of relationship love and people,positive
i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture,positive
however i bringing my american preconceptions enjoyed the film,positive
i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it,positive
the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be in some ways,positive
in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint and its series sequel the return of the saint val kilmer plays simon templar an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others,positive
this movie closely resembles a james bond flick,positive
it has the classic bond symbols a man who can do just about anything and get away with it a woman whom the man persues a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal,positive
kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations,positive
the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests,positive
as a young boy kilmers character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork,positive
that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name that of a catholic saint,positive
he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be,positive
this leads to a devestating mistake which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life,positive
kilmers first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak played by rade serbedzija,positive
during a press conference he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area avoiding guards cameras and many other potential obstacles,positive
once his mission is completed and he is safely home the fee is paid,positive
when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of 50 million he decides to carry out only one more mission then retire,positive
dr emma russell portrayed by elisabeth shue has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion,positive
this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia where millions are without heat and are freezing to death,positive
the only problem is tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people,positive
this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal,positive
tretiak hires him to steal the equations small pieces of paper from shue,positive
one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions,positive
they are very convincing not only to the characters in the movie but to us,positive
kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shues character into getting to know him even more which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula,positive
when the two meet and end up having a sensual experience kilmers character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell as she is falling in love with kilmers alterego a traveling artist,positive
yet he must reach his goal of 50 million which requires him to steal the energy formula putting his feelings aside,positive
shues character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces the names of the catholic saints together something no one else is able to do,positive
when she finds him they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak,positive
the saint is very actionpacked with few slow points,positive
the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments,positive
along the course of the movie there are even a few although brief moments of comedy,positive
these moments are almost always thanks to kilmers extraneous very convincing disguises and personalities,positive
all in all a rather enjoyable movie with nearly nonstop action,positive
warning to those who have not seen seven this review contains some spoiler information,positive
seven is a powerful fullyrealized film on the level of the silence of the lambs,positive
it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goalsit occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled,positive
while this film is not for the squeamish there is no denying that seven demands attention for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance,positive
for starters classifying seven as a thriller would not be an altogether complete classification of this film,positive
while i was genuinely thrilled throughout i would rather call seven an intense drama because that is what it deliversmeaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up,positive
part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style,positive
he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as simple as a corpse,positive
and visually fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in alltoorealistic and graphic terms courtesy of rob bottins alwaysgrisly special effects,positive
throw in the appropriate but nottobeunderestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene,positive
these scenes alone are quite impressive as fascinating as they are harrowing,positive
yet seven is more than just a technical accomplishment,positive
in addition to style fincher supplies substance,positive
seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society,positive
detective william somerset morgan freeman is a man who has nearly given up on the world,positive
its easy to see why,positive
the world doesnt make sense,positive
somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct,positive
after knocked down and robbed of his wallet the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes,positive
why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and picking up the pieces he will be able to catch the killer,positive
somersets new partner david mills brad pitt has not given up on the world perhaps because he is still young and perhaps by having this optimism hes naive in this films portrayal of the world,positive
he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope,positive
however davids wife gwyneth paltrow has so much fear of her urban surroundings she isnt even sure if she wants to tell her husband about her recent pregnancy let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment,positive
these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered,positive
and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world fincher gives us support for why they feel the way they do,positive
but if theres one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey it has to be the killer john doe kevin spacey,positive
sevens payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does,positive
one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a psycho with no motives behind his slayings,positive
this is exactly the mistake mills makes,positive
in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes were allowed to see that doe is in his mind merely a product of society,positive
hes a killer who kills those who are bringing society down,positive
in his mind he didnt kill innocent people and perhaps they were not completely innocent but then again who is,positive
hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent,positive
really seven doesnt just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwedup john doe is,positive
seven makes larger statements about how screwedup society is hinting that societys degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does,positive
besides the stylistic and largerissue arguments for seeing this film i recommend seven because it is after all also a very slick and wellmade thriller,positive
it features exciting plot developments commanding performances lots of suspense and a conclusion that is chilling riveting and quite unfair,positive
but then again its a cruel world,positive
youve got to love disney,positive
no matter what they serve up it is a guaranteed success as long as its animated,positive
kids have to go see the movie,positive
then they have to get the toys,positive
oh the video came out,positive
got to buy it or risk little billys temper tantrums for the next month,positive
all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca a visit to the magic kingdom,positive
stay at the disneyland hotel,positive
buy a disney tshirt,positive
eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick,positive
its both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it,positive
dale carnegie should have had it so good,positive
whats most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality,positive
you see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot,positive
the theme changes with each new movie the plot does not,positive
the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same,positive
however while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as boxoffice receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer,positive
luckily disneys latest animated offering mulan manages to be engaging and refreshing even while rife with formula,positive
the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns led by the imposing shanyu miguel ferrer,positive
soon chinas emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in chinas defense,positive
when the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soontek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household,positive
fearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan mingna wen disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army,positive
mulan based on a chinese epic poem is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling,positive
mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional womans role and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points,positive
very early on we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to ones family and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task,positive
by leaving home to fight in her fathers place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too,positive
as is the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film,positive
im not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time,positive
both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulans army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salongas voice translates much better to animation,positive
you have to hear it to understand,positive
interestingly the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan,positive
there is no significantly big number which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie,positive
it is however an expectation which has been built by disneys own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing,positive
artistically the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works it helps to contribute a more authentic and therefore more credible nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically disneyfied ethnic tale,positive
there are also a couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shanyus hun army which utilizes the same computerenhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast,positive
the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it,positive
when mulan resolves to take her fathers place she dons her fathers old battle armor and unsheathes a sword,positive
as she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal,positive
it just left me thinking that was really cool,positive
a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film varying from the straight such as soontek oh as fa zhou to the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao a gruff pugilistic member of shangs conscripted army,positive
even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan,positive
although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance,positive
i found the choice of b d,positive
wong as shang a little strange you may remember him as martin shorts wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so i guess anythings possible,positive
in any event wong performs admirably as well,positive
one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa,positive
she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people,positive
june foray who supplies grandmother fas speaking voice is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha,positive
marni nixon who provides grandmother fas singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady,positive
with this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history,positive
mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films,positive
in an effort to be culturally sensitive and to avoid a miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asianamerican actors for both lead and supporting roles,positive
in addition to the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei,positive
i guess clyde kusatsu wasnt available,positive
at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults,positive
this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better,positive
in the muse albert brooks plays steven phillips a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio,positive
they claim that hes lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them,positive
he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over,positive
so he turns to his best friend jack jeff bridges another screenwriter whos enjoyed success after success,positive
on the way over to jacks house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman sharon stone into a cab and begins to think is he having an affair,positive
when confronted jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is in fact a muse a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity and has helped him garner his success,positive
she doesnt do any actual writing he is told but inspires you,positive
steven is excited by what hes hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if shell take steven on as a new client,positive
jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present preferably something from tiffanys,positive
after the meeting the muse sarah decides to take on steven but at a price she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her like bringing her salads in the middle of the night,positive
stevens wife andy macdowell sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon,positive
steven confesses everything and although at first suspicious she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life,positive
the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble hes going through for her,positive
and thats a question only time will tell,positive
the muse is albert brooks sixth film as actor he cowrote with monica johnson and although its a good movie its not up to the level of his best works defending your life and mother,positive
the problem lies in the script and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor there arent nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good oneliners,positive
it has a great premise but doesnt deliver up to its full potential,positive
but i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit,positive
he may whine and complain but he just wants to support his family and be happy,positive
and i like sharon stone in this movie too its a nice change of pace for her,positive
and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner james cameron and martin scorsese,positive
and although the muse doesnt have as much to say about hollywood as robert altmans the player i still left the theater feeling good,positive
and thats something i wish i got out of more movies,positive
martin scorseses films used to intimidate me,positive
because of his reputation i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks,positive
as much as i enjoyed them i usually felt like i missed something,positive
i learned from scorseses casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story,positive
no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies,positive
for example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other,positive
there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on,positive
or toward the end when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building,positive
again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing,positive
i dont mean to say that his techniques are not creative or goodlooking,positive
but he simply uses the best tool for the job,positive
it shouldnt have surprised me then that kundun a film about a mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward,positive
the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet,positive
the movies title is another name for the dalai lama which means ocean of wisdom,positive
his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story,positive
one of which makes an interesting statement pay attention to the films opening shot and watch where it is repeated,positive
we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old,positive
his curiosity and selfassuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama,positive
a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before,positive
several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items,positive
the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own,positive
the boy picks correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama,positive
scorsese and longtime editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk,positive
before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation,positive
sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made a second choice,positive
either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise perceptive leader,positive
from this point on the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lamas spirit and the future leader of a nation,positive
it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child,positive
in the u s it might be grounds for a call to social services,positive
but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage,positive
neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable wellrounded person,positive
certain patterns take shape over the years,positive
for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology,positive
radios clocks and telescopes are some of his favorite toys,positive
when he is old enough to accept his leadership he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet,positive
he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain including herd animals,positive
its nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter,positive
but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibets gigantic neighbor china,positive
tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china as first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the armies come across their common border,positive
the chinese invasion is so successful that the lamas life is in danger if he stays,positive
the movie ends when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaves tibet for india,positive
the story doesnt lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do,positive
it just doesnt fit that mold,positive
if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie perhaps more like seven years in tibet which is good in its own right,positive
the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that,positive
the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events not viceversa,positive
perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestments and architecture of tibet,positive
a mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie,positive
the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold,positive
the bricks are a rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans,positive
even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet,positive
philip glass composed the music for kundun and he was the perfect choice,positive
for those who dont know of glass his music is like a tibetan mandala,positive
his building blocks are lots of small notes tiny grains of music which are first grouped then repeated in patterns,positive
these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition,positive
people wont be flocking to kundun for its great ending or talking about its outstanding plot but it does have a lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sights rich cinematography and innovative music,positive
it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person,positive
on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who gives the film a strong beautiful consistent look,positive
my summer was recently saved by two very different movies,positive
on opening night i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron,positive
then a few nights later i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershmans greenfingers even though it didnt feature a trip to band camp girlongirl action or seann william scott,positive
however i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs clive owen of croupier,positive
after spending roughly half of his life behind bars he is transferred to a more lenient facility edgefield,positive
the picaresque rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges,positive
at first briggs doesnt want to be there,positive
hes used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone,positive
however his ailing roommate fergus david kelly of waking ned devine wears briggs down through his benign nature,positive
the two become friends with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift,positive
briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers,positive
after the prisons governor warren clarke reprimands them hes awed at what briggs has accomplished,positive
and hes struck by an idea briggs fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prisons grounds,positive
greenfingers which is inspired by actual events becomes a bit like a sports movie after that,positive
despite their differences the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game in this case a prestigious garden show,positive
one renegade in this case briggs will prove to have talent,positive
of course love will also rear its head no not prison love,positive
to hershmans credit he doesnt pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs like last years lame marijuana comedy saving grace,positive
i had to keep pinching myself when i didnt see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies or the men giving highfives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers,positive
the movie deals with people and scores on that concept,positive
its wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again,positive
give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting,positive
his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freemans last stand in the shawshank redemption,positive
owens bedside scenes with kelly who lends the film a human touch are a marvel to behold emotionally gripping without being sappy,positive
written by hershman greenfingers contains plenty of laughs,positive
most come courtesy of helen mirren who shines as the worldclass gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose natasha little when she starts dating briggs,positive
the mother cant believe what hell do if her daughter burns the sunday roast,positive
nothing is forced in greenfingers,positive
the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines,positive
primrose and briggs relationship takes awkward steps,positive
even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield its done for reasons of loyalty not because the movie requires him to do so,positive
after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like americas sweethearts and the princess dairies its an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well,positive
hilarious ultralow budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers brian ohalloran and jeff anderson,positive
they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to selffulfillment,positive
the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all getout but you could spend ten times the films budget a reported 27 000 and still not get dialogue half as good as this,positive
originally rated nc17 for language,positive
not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears,positive
killing zoe,positive
remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and youre halfway to killing zoe roger avarys slowmoving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery,positive
eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in way over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers,positive
hes the safecracker whos blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go,positive
though intriguing on all fronts the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction which avary cowrote with quentin tarantino,positive
in english and french,positive
the road to wellville,positive
based on the novel by t coraghessan boyle the road to wellville doesnt go very far,positive
bowels bowels and more bowels are explored by dr john harvey kellogg a bucktoothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins who in the early 1900s advocated abstinence vegetarianism and frequent defecation,positive
he also invented the cornflake,positive
really,positive
checkingin to kelloggs battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda just two of the many wellknown faces in this failed comedy,positive
leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack michael lerner lara flynn boyle john neville and dana carvey,positive
the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing but the novelty quickly wears off as alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doodoo into drama,positive
what he ends up with is something that i cant print here,positive
phew,positive
stargate,positive
lawrence of arabia meets star wars,positive
this epic scifi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else,positive
director roland emmerich universal solider shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on,positive
the film is overlong the characters are cardboard and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern scifi history,positive
that said theres still plenty to watch here,positive
scifi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands the morphing headdresses and a surprisingly spunky james spader,positive
he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that somebody else built the pyramids,positive
less interesting are costars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame,positive
star trek generations,positive
trek fans may be more forgiving but for the rest of us the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best,positive
the story is interesting but each scene goes too long,positive
the cast is earnest but the direction lacks punch,positive
and so on,positive
the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii,positive
original enterprise captain james t kirk appears on both ends of the story though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead get a life,positive
remarkably unremarkable,positive
miracle on 34th street,positive
in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street is necessary,positive
john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfielddirected production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original,positive
the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesnt work too well but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle,positive
his chemistry with children can moisten any eye,positive
no claus for alarm,positive
junior,positive
arnold schwarzenegger pregnant,positive
sure billy crystal did it before in rabbit test but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie,positive
what should be nothing more than a onejoke premise actually gets better as it goes along,positive
director ivan reitman dave twins wisely keeps the farce to a minimum so the first hour moves slower than you might expect,positive
dont expect too many yuks from danny devito but you cant beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie,positive
hows that for a collision of acting styles,positive
robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible godgiven gifts but are able to act like ordinary people,positive
in the natural 1984 he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined to be the best there ever was but still acted like a humble farm boy,positive
in butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly goodlooking charmer,positive
even in indecent proposal 1993 where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting a tale of lost love,positive
in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the bestselling novel by nicholas evans redford again plays such a character,positive
redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie i suppose the character of tom booker a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses was just too good to pass up,positive
despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses a magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life,positive
bookers talents are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas a new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently in a horrible accident,positive
the accident which is filmed with gutwrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses an eighteenwheeler kills graces friend severely wounds and traumatizes graces horse pilgrim and causes grace to lose part of her right leg,positive
annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed as well which leads her to booker,positive
at first she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesnt work,positive
instead she packs up grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sisterinlaw diane dianne wiest,positive
in many ways the film is like a journey both literally and symbolically,positive
the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal and its hard not to see annie and graces leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs country,positive
in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor,positive
the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the characters arrive in the wideopen spaces of montana that graces anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate annies controlling nature begins to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people,positive
redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed a river runs through it six years ago,positive
in many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein as river and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less cameratime on the grass and mountains,positive
but then that would ruin the magic,positive
much of the films photography is truly elegant and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land,positive
to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film which takes place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 85 1 aspect ratio when the action shifts to montana richardson switches to softfocus and natural lighting and the screen widens to a 2 35 1 aspect ratio,positive
in terms of the story itself the horse whisperer gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david leans a brief encounter 1945 and clint eastwoods 1995 adaptation of robert james wallers the bridges of madison county richard lagravenese coscreenwriter here also adapted bridges,positive
although the horse whisperer has a strong romantic sensibility i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story,positive
it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband whos being left behind for this brief heartsweeping affair but there rarely is,positive
in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddyduddy husband falls to sam neill,positive
he plays the character as a decent hardworking man who is a good husband and father his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him,positive
he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be a normal fairly uninspiring man,positive
there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character,positive
it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and outofplace in a baseball cap,positive
as they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and in a goofy moment forgets to close it behind him,positive
its a small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movies thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness,positive
after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it,positive
the best scenes in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse,positive
although bookers horsetraining methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing,positive
these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true,positive
at some point i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more,positive
nevertheless redford is obviously a romantic at heart and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film,positive
there are no dramatic sex scenes but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together,positive
although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission,positive
virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre,positive
since dark city 1998 films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another,positive
the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix,positive
all the films released after it have been less successful,positive
david cronenbergs existenz released only a couple of months after the matrix was accepted and even appreciated by some but the hype was gone,positive
and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall it was completely overseen and ignored,positive
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying feeling like eating the same meal over and over again,positive
it was therefore i was less than excited when i went out to see to the thirteenth floor,positive
however i was positively surprised by josef rusnaks latest picture,positive
matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality combining the best of hollywoods action and effects with an intelligent story,positive
existenz was a violent gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality ending in blood and madness,positive
the thirteenth floor is somewhere in between,positive
instead of going after the crowds the action audience like the matrix or aiming at the horror fans like existenz the thirteenth floor presents a more intelligent plot witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding,positive
in a near future on,positive
the thirteenth floor of a classified building a genius scientist hannon fuller has created a simulated world his personal dreamworld where every inhabitant is a complex selflearning program that only believes it is real,positive
right after the first testing of this world fuller is found murdered,positive
douglas hall his closest friend and business partner immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth,positive
a beautiful woman gretchen mol who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence,positive
the first download into simulation is impressive,positive
it is the creators first visit to his world his creation,positive
in order to enter this virtual universe you have to take over someones identity become another person,positive
this is called conciseness transfer and this is part of the tragedy in the film people wake up in unknown places and strange things start happen,positive
they start to doubt in their own sanity,positive
these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their users and creators with their sanity and their lives,positive
it is a frightening reality the fact that all the people in the simulation the program links are living out their lives oblivious not knowing that they are puppets in someones fantasy,positive
with an appealing blade runner type of detective story this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present,positive
our modern world is metal and glass cold unfriendly impersonal,positive
the thirties are different colorful beautiful elegant virile,positive
this contrast demonstrates a wish for change,positive
virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities,positive
to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise to some a personal playground a life without any consequences,positive
for others a way to start over and correct their mistakes by living in an illusion of their past,positive
virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes dreams and fantasies to life,positive
at least thats how it is all beginning,positive
but when youre waking up from your dream the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise,positive
this almost narcotic effect soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness,positive
some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised what is real,positive
what is thought,positive
who are we,positive
if these were answered this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made,positive
they are off course not answered but posed in an intelligent manner,positive
the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements since it portrays the contrast between these computersimulated universes,positive
kirk m petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour grace and color and setting this world in opposition to our own an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties,positive
there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald kloses moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time,positive
a rather unusual thing aboutthe thirteenth floor is the almost complete lack of special effects,positive
there are no cgi animated creatures no bullets in slow motion,positive
this is a more philosophical approach reminding about the european way of filmmaking,positive
this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark cityfans will be pleased,positive
this film is interesting and inspiring,positive
it has everything existenz doesnt but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix,positive
and then there is a happy end which like in dark city completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context,positive
the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics including blade runner and dark city,positive
with this in mind the thirteenth floor doesnt make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now yet this is a beautiful elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality,positive
corey yuens latest film hero is notable on two fronts,positive
first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production,positive
secondly the film is the rediscovery of yuen biao,positive
the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai,positive
poverty and crime rule most of china,positive
a young man ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier,positive
tam see is the most powerful gangster in town having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army,positive
wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation,positive
their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams wing jings to be a powerful and wealthy man and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love,positive
wing jing meets the singer at the club jessica hester and falls in love with her not realizing that she is the star attraction,positive
after stealing her picture from a display wing jing and his brother plot to impress her,positive
first they rob two foreigners of their money and cloths and set up a midnight rendezvous,positive
unfortunately wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of sees night club,positive
the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn,positive
jessica having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night gives up and returns home,positive
see decides to retire he gives the night club to wing jing as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder,positive
see arranges the trade and ask his lover valerie chow to take care of wing jing,positive
unfortunately she has sided with yeung seung,positive
the performances in the film are all top notch with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow,positive
the comic turn by yuen wah previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hungs eastern condors is a marvelous surprise,positive
his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious,positive
the standout is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments with a stellar performance,positive
his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride,positive
his gangster is almost nonviolent in that he only retaliates never instigates violence,positive
but when the time comes to fight yuen biao has never looked better,positive
corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late,positive
the lighting cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch,positive
the action scenes do not disappoint either,positive
this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography ive seen in some time actually surpassing jackie chans work in both rumble in the bronx and first strike,positive
the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible,positive
an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed,positive
also noteworthy is the score for the film done in a marvelously lush orchestral style not representative of most hong kong fare,positive
i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both titanic and rosewood as best of the year,positive
all in all hero marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers,positive
this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing,positive
youd think it would be easy to spoof star trek but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it,positive
thats a bit more difficult,positive
the farfetched scifi series is after all enormously popular what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies,positive
if youre not nice to it you lose,positive
galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brookss spaceballs was to star wars an affectionate riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems meanspirited or malintentioned,positive
the shows been cancelled but the journey is far from over,positive
that is the current tagline of galaxy quest a star trek type show thats no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns,positive
it also lives on in conventions gatherings of the shows obsessive fans who never fail to dress in galaxy quest costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble,positive
jason nesmith tim allen played commander peter quincy taggart on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do,positive
the attitudes of the rest tommy webber daryl mitchell gwen demarco sigourney weaver fred kwan tony shalhoub and alexander dane alan rickman range from indifference to utter contempt,positive
dane who played a spocklike alien is especially disgusted considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his characters cheesy trademark line by grabthars hammer you shall be avenged or something like that for his diehard fans,positive
one day nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of galaxy quest followers,positive
they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia,positive
they have mistaken the galaxy quest episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel,positive
the next day the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris named in one of the films only meanspirited gags after village voice film critic andrew sarris,positive
nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig and sort of blows it off but when he is transported or i should say shot back to earth in a rather celestial manner he believes,positive
next thing the cast knows they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship,positive
of course they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them,positive
but after some persuading they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians,positive
i was quite surprised how well this comedy which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign worked,positive
taking shots at both the obvious and notsoobvious elements of star trek and its fandom galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs opting instead for broad but smart parody,positive
nothing is safe not the cliches not the fans not the absurd taglines but on the other hand everything is safe since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration,positive
the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoubs fred a k a tech sergeant chen who when in character is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek,positive
while scotty who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell i need more power down here captain,positive
chens cry for help is more to the tune of the core like wont take it or something,positive
its a hoot but it doesnt stop there weaver whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman with his relentlessly holierthanthou attitude arent far behind,positive
galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while its not a masterpiece it tends to falter in its more serious moments it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season,positive
by grabthars hammer this is a hell of a movie,positive
field of dreams almost defies description,positive
although its about baseball its not a baseball movie,positive
although the film is extremely spiritual its not about religion,positive
and although field of dreams is melodramatic its not a tearjerker,positive
to really understand what field of dreams is all about you have to see it,positive
in the film kevin costner plays ray kinsella a baseball fan 60s berkeley graduate and iowa farmer,positive
one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields ray hears a voice it tells him if you build it he will come,positive
then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again,positive
and even though it depletes his familys savings and his neighbors think hes crazy ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field complete with bleachers and flood lights,positive
if you build it he will come,positive
and lo and behold shoeless joe does comebringing with him several of his dead teammates,positive
and then ray hears the voice again it tells him to ease his pain,positive
ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann an influential and radical novelist from the 60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society,positive
with great aplomb james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey,positive
the cast in field of dreams is excellent especially kevin costner in the lead role,positive
costner gives a quiet subtle and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life,positive
costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale,positive
amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as rays feisty and loving wife who against her better judgement supports her husbands crazy ideas,positive
in her most impressive scene madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p t a,positive
meeting displaying the sincere passion of a 60s berkeley radical,positive
ray liotta is appropriately eerie and aweinspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago black sox scandal,positive
and finally burt lancaster is memorable in a small but important role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning,positive
field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life wonder mystery spirit and humor,positive
it for the most part succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief,positive
ray kinsellas spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous,positive
but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama it unfortunately does at times go overboard and by the end it gets downright sappy,positive
in general however field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasyone i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics,positive
every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget and forgive its glaring imperfections,positive
such is the case with good will hunting a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life,positive
despite some serious character problems this is still a very good film,positive
you probably know about the plot so i ll make it quick,positive
will hunting damon is a janitor at m i t he s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it,positive
he likes to go out with his friend chuckie affleck and their other workingclass buddies and drink beer,positive
he s goodlooking charismatic and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk,positive
after getting into a tiff with the law a distinguished professor skarsg rd discovers will s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time at a price he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems that have stumped the academic elite with the professor,positive
after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a oncepromising therapist named sean maguire williams who has his own problems,positive
in the meantime will meets a british medical school student driver and they begin to fall in love,positive
the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film,positive
even though we ve seen movies about misunderstood erratic prodigies before shine ring a bell the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn t just focus solely on one character,positive
alas though this is not a perfect film as much as you feel like it could ve been while watching it,positive
the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character,positive
is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent,positive
of course,positive
is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep human relationships,positive
usually yes,positive
but is it possible for him to also be so handsome funny quick with the tongue and citystreet tough,positive
not very likely,positive
come on usually these guys are total nerds who can t even buy their own shirts much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med school,positive
girls,positive
will is just a little too perfect and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition,positive
the heavyhanded antiwar statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish overlong pompous and completely unnecessary,positive
all this sounds pretty bad but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways,positive
damon s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable his performance is truly extraordinary,positive
which leads me to the really good part of the review,positive
the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word acting,positive
i can t recall seeing a film recently that was so wellacted from top to bottom,positive
from minnie driver s frustrated lover to ben affleck s laidback best friend and all the small roles in between the performances are magnificent,positive
robin williams skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line,positive
the real gem though is stellan skarsg rd s turn as professor lambeau an awardwinning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger smarter will hunting,positive
the scenes between williams and skarsg rd as two old college pals who ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid display some of the best acting i ve ever seen,positive
when i say delivering the goods this is what i m talking about,positive
watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about,positive
gus van sant s to die for drugstore cowboy cold urban direction is right on as well as danny elfman s sauntering musical score,positive
i highly recommend good will hunting,positive
despite its faults it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year,positive
the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen kings work,positive
this slowmoving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals but suffers from a tepid conclusion inconsistent direction and may not have wide commercial appeal,positive
when the maid dolores claiborne is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer it seems like an openandshut murder case,positive
upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax dolores estranged and bitter daughter esquire magazine writer selena st george returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home,positive
as the two clash horns the story behind the mysterious death of dolores abusive husband two decades ago ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey is revealed,positive
did dolores kill her husband,positive
and did she kill her employer,positive
dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller,positive
consequently it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywoods finest character actors such as bates leigh and strathairn,positive
kathy bates plays the films title character and gives a sensational lead performance,positive
dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates as her character has a huge amount of screen time,positive
she dominates the screen producing a character that is compelling and arresting as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks,positive
kathy bates performance is awardcalibre stuff,positive
the rest of the cast is also very good,positive
jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour bitter helena st george well and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores everpresent nemesis the determined detective john mackey,positive
david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores husband joe st george,positive
judy parfitt is fine as dolores tyrannic socialite employer vera donovanit would have been interesting to see say meg foster in this role,positive
child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences she is very impressive,positive
the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right to parts which are embarrassingly hokey,positive
the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hitandmiss in terms of effectiveness,positive
the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up,positive
however the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderfuli particularly like the chilling iceblue hue permeating the presentday scenes contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shotsand danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film,positive
it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited,positive
none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw and its pacing may be a turnoff to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axewielding psychopaths,positive
although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand,positive
dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion and moves very slowly,positive
however the performances are uniformly excellent particularly kathy bates and the film has its moments,positive
on my fourstar scale i give dolores claiborne three stars,positive
call 911 for the cliche police if you must but the eyes are the window to the soul,positive
the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze paul newman ralph fiennes anthony hopkins morgan freeman,positive
you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds that the characters they play are real human beings,positive
we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor but he had that unique quality in his eyes,positive
in gridlockd an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire shakur and his costar tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry,positive
shakur and roth play ezekiel spoon whitmore and alexander stretch rome two detroit buddies who share a spoken trio an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie thandie newton,positive
when a new years eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time,positive
they soon make a new years resolution to get into rehab but that proves to be easier said than done,positive
as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy confusion and red tape,positive
the government might be the least of their obstacles however as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer and on the run from a nasty thug vondie curtis hall,positive
in order for you to buy into gridlockd at all you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government offices on new years day in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all,positive
gridlockd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey 1991s falling down which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles,positive
in falling down michael douglas dfens the characters personalized license plate echoed in gridlockd by the drug lord drepers plates whips out a gun because he cant get breakfast at mcdonalds in gridlockd spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center,positive
and where the unhinged dfens became a heroic surrogate for audiences vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation,positive
one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just,positive
because you picked today to clean up,positive
the world in gridlockd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time,positive
hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them,positive
a significant chunk of gridlockd is devoted to spoon and stretchs flight from dreper and from the police and those subplots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments,positive
in one scene stretch scares off dreper by getting chummy with a police officer another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenlysuspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures,positive
the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time,positive
hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the films main events perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through selfdestructive behavior,positive
oh the irony of it,positive
tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case and living the life to back it up,positive
in gridlockd shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him,positive
spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction,positive
mostly it comes through those eyes eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta,positive
it is spoon who plays conscience to stretchs pure appetite and roth plays stretch with a gleeful selfdestructiveness he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again which is as much an obstacle to spoons goal as any agency or enemy,positive
gridlockds most cruelly comic scene finds stretch helping spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him,positive
with friends like that spoon doesnt need enemies and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much,positive
the tragedy now is that we wont get more chances to see those eyes again,positive
when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called the postman i thought an american version of il postino,positive
starring costner,positive
god help us,positive
when i found out that it was not a remake of postino but an postapocalyptic epic i thought landworld,positive
please god make him stop,positive
as it turns out the postman is a much better film than i had expected,positive
despite being set in 2013 the movie is at heart a western a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back,positive
the setting however allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages,positive
the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it,positive
costners nameless character a wandering actor rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem will patton a former copymachine salesman turned bandit king,positive
our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman,positive
taking the uniform and bag of mail he passes himself off as a representative of the restored united states,positive
he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets,positive
one young disciple ford lincoln mercury larenz tate organizes a fullscale postal service,positive
ford spreads the postmans message of hope until bethlehem finds that the oncemeek villagers are beginning to resist his rule,positive
as war breaks out between bethlehems army and the postal workers costners character steps into the legend he created and goes from selfcentered loner to leader of the revolution,positive
his lie of the restored united states becomes a selffulfilling prophecy,positive
postman is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wideeyed optimism sort of sergio leone meets frank capra but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling,positive
what could have been another knockoff of the road warrior like waterworld was surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble,positive
tate is the standout in the movies large cast,positive
ford lincoln mercury selfnamed is the polar opposite of odog tates character in his debut film menace ii society 1993 and tate makes fords innocent belief in hope as convincing as odogs cynicism and brutality,positive
his performance sells the movie,positive
interestingly as tate moves from his usual streetsmart roles to youthful optimism the softeyed patton who usually plays nice guys proves a disarming villain,positive
olivia williams makes her film debut as the postmans love interest abby,positive
when they first meet abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile,positive
predictably the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero,positive
however their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored she torn by grief guilt and anger he resisting his destiny,positive
the postman is costners best work thus far,positive
perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future,positive
susan grangers review of songcatcher in the midst of this summers fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes there are a few thoughtful movies and this appalachian period drama is one,positive
oscar nominee janet mcteer tumbleweeds stars as dr lily penleric an accomplished musicologist who back in that prefeminist era was refused a full professorship at her university,positive
determined to prove her worth she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina where her younger sister elna jane adams runs a school,positive
there in bear creek she discovers a treasuretrove of traditional scotsirish and english folk ballads given a unique interpretation by the insular locals,positive
excited she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler pat carroll and other selfsustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders,positive
their music as she puts it is as much a part of life here as the air you breathe,positive
thats the main thrust of writerdirector maggie greenwalds occasionally uneven cultureclash story which is loosely based on olive dame campbells foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908 but theres also some melodramatic romantic spice,positive
ornery bearded banjopicking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque passionate songcatcher while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague e,positive
katherine kerr,positive
im ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris iris dement taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteers wideeyed prot g,positive
rated pg13 theres an intense scene of primitive childbirth,positive
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 songcatcher is an intelligent extraordinary 8 transported by the transcendent power of song,positive
hedwig and the angry inch 2001 john cameron mitchell miriam shor stephen trask michael pitt theodore liscinski michael aronov andrea martin maurice dean wint ben mayergoodman,positive
animation by emily hubley,positive
adapted from the stage play by john cameron mitchell and stephen trask,positive
music and lyrics by stephn trask,positive
written and directed by john cameron mitchell,positive
91 minutes,positive
rated r stars,positive
had hedwig and the angry inch came out in the 70s right after david bowies ziggy stardust it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time,positive
released in the 500 channel sensory overload world of 2001 however the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed offbroadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention,positive
i almost missed it,positive
every august the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once,positive
i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like summer catch and bubble boy that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run,positive
but an email from a reader asking why i hadnt reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater,positive
thank goodness for readers like him,positive
hedwig and the angry inch is a genderbending glamrock spectacular packed with great songs,positive
stylistically the hookladen tunes are reminiscent of bowie bat out of hell era meatloaf and the rocky horror show without ever seeming like imitations,positive
as with tommy hedwig tells a story of isolation pain and defiance but without the bloated feel of that beloved but overrated rock opera,positive
writerdirectorstar john cameron mitchell and composerlyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner,positive
mitchell stars as hedwig a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u s coffee shops with her panslavic band the angry inch,positive
while the patrons of the rundown restaurants look on in shock and sometimes horror hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song,positive
she was once a boy named hansel ben mayergoodman living with his mother alberta watson and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio,positive
life is an exercise in duality for hansel,positive
a wall splits his hometown into two parts,positive
mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half,positive
as hansel grows up the duality becomes more pronounced,positive
after initially mistaking him for a girl a gi from the states maurice dean wint falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him,positive
alas hansel will never pass the mandatory physical,positive
mother helpfully suggests a sex change but the operation goes bad hence the references to the angry inch yes i know this part is squirminducing but stick with me its worth it,positive
several years later mr right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig decked out in a farrah fawcettstyle wig and fronting a band made up of korean women,positive
hedwig finds a new love in tommy michael pitt a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity,positive
but tommy does hedwig wrong stealing her songs and becoming a superstar,positive
cut to the present,positive
tommy gnosis stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him,positive
despite warnings from her manager andrea martin that she could easily be labeled a stalker hegwig and her new band the angry inch continue their coffee shop tour shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in,positive
if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of tommy and rocky horror,positive
as hedwig john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being,positive
mitchell has worldclass style and vocal chords to match,positive
even though the backstory is unusually strong mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical,positive
everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and trust me these are fullfledged rock songs not the overprocessed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals,positive
while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film there is much of interest on the sidelines,positive
miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak hedwigs lover and bandmate conveying a great deal through expressions alone,positive
decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard she makes a mighty attractive man,positive
as always sctv veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy the angelicappearing little rat,positive
artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical,positive
hedwig and the angry inch surrounds a weird funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast,positive
true originals do not come along very often dont let this slip out of town without seeing it,positive
my filmcritic com,positive
colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 brad andersons throwback to spooky horror films from the 70s,positive
it worked as an eerie homage without being selfreferential or smugly postmodern,positive
genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubricks the shining and george romeros dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative i e a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum unspeakable dread ensues,positive
in a doublewhammy for 2001 anderson shoots and mostly scores again with his eclectic riff on timetravel episodes from the twilight zone appropriately titled happy accidents,positive
much like session 9 the cards are played very close to the vest here,positive
is boyish eccentric sam deed from dubuque iowa a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your runofthemill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the presentday streets of nyc,positive
as played by wonderful character actor vincent donofrio full metal jacket its up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted,positive
the question proves to be moot at least for a time,positive
even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend ruby marisa tomei hes a freak but he sure tells a good story,positive
neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters the junkie the fetishist the artist the frenchman etc but isnt quite sure how to handle sam deed when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm his elaborately constructed fake identity his pathological fear of dogs his ability to speak five different languages and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on times alternate realities,positive
dont ask,positive
its all a bit much to take in,positive
rubys close friend gretchen cuz ya cant have a love story without the token friend though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth chalks it up as a sexy roleplaying game but her cautious therapist holland taylor warns her that codependency is rearing its ugly head again and shes in over her head with yet another doomed relationship,positive
who ya gonna believe,positive
despite her winning an academy award marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents,positive
her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear cute to her adoring fans,positive
being loud and flashing a disingenuous smile does not necessarily equal substantial and sexy,positive
it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality,positive
then theres that damned voice which strains to be ohsoadorable,positive
look this stuff is purely subjective,positive
some people feel this way about richard gere others cannot bear to watch robin williams hyperactive schtick,positive
for my money its m tomei with a bullet,positive
happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys or more appropriately chris markers la jetee especially with those still framed memory photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout,positive
modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logans run,positive
as the stranger in a strange land donofrio walks slightly outofstep wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment,positive
this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion though it often falls into the scifi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition we want deeds not words,positive
at least twenty minutes too long happy accidents eventually gets around to a raceagainsttime scenario that puts sam deed to the ultimate test,positive
no movie can live in ambiguity forever but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives,positive
lets pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened shall we,positive
there are also some slow repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not hes crazy,positive
the premise is strong enough to sustain interest but its enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in halfhour time slots commercials included,positive
in 1977 something never though possible happened,positive
the film star wars was released with extraordinary never seen before techniques of special effects,positive
the film set a new standard for special effects in film,positive
not only did it set a standard for the special effects it set a standard for film itself,positive
the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever,positive
the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi,positive
the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side,positive
darth vader is the leader of the dark side,positive
ben obiwan kenobi played by sir alec guinness was one of those jedi who is still alive today,positive
darth vader was once a jedi until he turned to the dark side,positive
years after the killing of the jedi darth vader is still around causing trouble,positive
r2d2 and c3p0 are both what we call driods or robots that are of assistance to humans,positive
while an attack on the ship that princess leia played by carrie fisher is aboard she inserts a message to r2d2 who is also on the ship,positive
to obiwan kenobi pleading for help,positive
the princess is captured by vader but r2d2 and c3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine,positive
the jawas or small creatures who sell droids pick r2d2 and c3p0 up to sell,positive
they are bought by luke skywalkers mark hamill family,positive
while luke is cleaning the droids the message from princess leia is found,positive
luke finds this obiwan kenobi and learns that obiwan was a friend of lukes father who is now dead,positive
luke also learns his family was a jedi,positive
after lukes family is killed by tropps from the dark side ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all,positive
ben wants to create a new jedi,positive
first the two must find princess leia and serve her,positive
han solo played by harrison ford and his sidekick chewbacca played by peter mayhew are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary,positive
after meeting up with leia the film really picks up,positive
luke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi ben kenobi confronts darth vader and many other interesting events occur,positive
star wars is an amazing epic,positive
the plot is so original and amazing i cannot believe it,positive
the special effects especially for its time are wonderful and realistic,positive
the space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch,positive
the ships flown by all are very unique and creative,positive
the costumes are also out of this world,positive
the scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before,positive
there are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever,positive
the entire premise of star wars is amazing,positive
the creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind,positive
even the human characters are different,positive
every character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films,positive
the acting on everyones part is great especially that of sir alec guinnesss,positive
even though the concept is not realistic at all it is pulled off very nicely,positive
the acting setting effects costumes and sound make it work,positive
if any of these were messed up star wars would have come off as one huge joke,positive
the ending works very well and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward,positive
in early 1997 a special edition of star wars was released,positive
the film was remastered so it looked better than it did in 1977,positive
a few creatures were added here and there and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt seen in return of the jedi was added to the film,positive
think thats enough,positive
on may 19 1999 star wars episode i the phantom menace will be released followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope,positive
with this star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time,positive
robert benton has assembled a stellar mature cast for his latest feature twilight a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood,positive
paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross,positive
harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames gene hackman and susan sarandon a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight,positive
when jack sends him on a routine delivery job however the old instincts kick in,positive
soon harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line and he no longer knows who to trust,positive
there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight in addition to newman hackman and sarandon,positive
james garner plays raymond hope a former cop and one of harrys best friends,positive
stockard channing plays verna harrys former partner and possibly a former love interest,positive
reese witherspoon is mel the distrustful daughter of the ames and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend,positive
giancarlo esposito appears as harrys bumbling detective protigi and john spencer is a suspicious police captain,positive
with a cast like that its almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze,positive
luckily theres more to the film than some sort of actors recognition ceremony,positive
twilight has a solid film noirish plot,positive
it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days,positive
the major cast members all deliver strong performances as can be expected of their caliber,positive
however none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable,positive
the supporting cast is enjoyable if a little underdrawn,positive
stockard channings character in particular is a cipher,positive
theres more to her character than the film takes the time to describe,positive
its a minor but irritating flaw,positive
with a solid cast and a good plot theres a lot to recommend about twilight,positive
its biggest flaw is actually its short running time,positive
at a slim 94 minutes theres a lot of stuff thats packed into an awfully small package,positive
still the chance to see newman sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two,positive
city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most thoughtprovoking moving and completely unsentimental,positive
i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality,positive
city of angels is a wonderful film enhanced by interesting and wellrounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years,positive
its a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story and avoids most of the cliches were so used to seeing in films like this,positive
city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders 1988 film wings of desire,positive
i have yet to see wings of desire so i am unfortunately unable to make a comparison of the two,positive
i have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways which makes me glad that this film isnt a ripoff of its source material,positive
nicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present to lead the dying to heaven or somewhere just like it,positive
one day he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called to her,positive
the angels can make themselves seen to humans but they cant experience any of the senses most importantly touch,positive
he shows himself to maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status,positive
seth wants to become human so he can feel her,positive
thats when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race,positive
as a side note i found messinger to be the most fascinating character for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death,positive
messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human,positive
seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel i know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally welldone after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel,positive
this of course is when seth decides to take the plunge literally from a building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy to feel what its like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead,positive
since i love this film so much ill make a minor note that it certainly isnt perfect,positive
although it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre,positive
the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done a great job with them,positive
the ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable,positive
these elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels,positive
the acting is superb from everyone involved,positive
this is perhaps my secondfavorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock,positive
hes quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softlytoned words,positive
hes perfect for a role like this and at the same time he reassures us hes not bound by playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in,positive
meg ryan is a powerful enticing and appealinglychirpy actress and her work here is some of her best,positive
dennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic formerangel,positive
what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation,positive
director brad silberling is a talented man and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters rather than forced sentimentality,positive
his direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead,positive
there is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information,positive
this is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real,positive
the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do,positive
cinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images ive seen on the big screen hundreds of blackclad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example,positive
the music by gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this film its quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely,positive
the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far,positive
all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre,positive
its a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story acrossthe excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously,positive
susan grangers review of big eden jour de fete,positive
its utopia this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers nan martin louise fletcher eagerly pair off the young people regardless of sexual preference,positive
theres nary a homophobe or bigot around much to the surprise of henry hart arye gross a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam george coe the ailing grandfather who raised him,positive
and with the simultaneous reappearance of his bestfriend from highschool and object of his unrequited love tim dekay now divorced with two young sons the fact of his homosexuality must be faced,positive
to complete the triangle theres the tall taciturn native american eric schweig who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam,positive
this fable about home and family is a major debut for firsttime filmmaker thomas bezucha a former designer for coach and lauren who is meticulous about minding details using ballads like welcome to my world and achin breakin heart to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved,positive
in the paradise of big eden what you are doesnt matter as much as generosity of spirit respect and kindness,positive
sure the plots implausible but its a goodnatured fantasy so allowances should be made,positive
and rob sweeneys photography of glacier national park is spectacular,positive
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 big eden is a charming quirky offbeat 7,positive
its a heartwarming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesnt die of aids or wind up alone at the end,positive
when jim henson passed away he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success it now seems hinged on his input,positive
jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially but as the last two muppet films or that silly computergenerated monkey from lost in space demonstrate the thrill and genius are gone,positive
im not sure the dark crystal made today would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awefilled response,positive
an allpowerful crystal has cracked causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings the big gentle mystics and the vulturelike skeksis,positive
the mystics send jen a naive gelfling boy on a mission to find the shard that cracked away which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers before the great conjunction of three suns,positive
along the way jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive the rebecca demornaylike kira an ogrewitch named aughra who removes her eyes to look at things and a spasticbutfriendly tumbleweedlike animal named fizzgig,positive
much of the beauty in the dark crystal which is a simple tale though it does not condescend to any viewer lies in its art direction and creature design,positive
the puppeteering is phenomenalobserve the scenes in which jen plays his flute or the landwalker chasebut i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture a delicatelynarrated by john baddeley absorbing prologue,positive
the voice work in the film by muppet regulars and irregulars is toneperfect,positive
as well trevor jones score should not be discounted it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character,positive
i suppose due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature that it couldnt be helped but i wish the film was longer,positive
jen and kira have wonderful well,positive
chemistry and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated,positive
the dark crystal has a very small cult following,positive
the weaker labyrinth is probably betterknown which is upsetting,positive
a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinths creatures due to the financial failure of peopleless the dark crystal,positive
that film never quite found its footing it played like an acidtrip episode of the muppet show with david bowie as guesthost borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkiens fanbase,positive
i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public,positive
the dark crystal deserved and still deserves a bigger audience,positive
its the best kind of childrens entertainment elegant fantastical and courageously unhip,positive
brian henson fortunate son keep looking back at this your fathers masterpiece,positive
i had lost all faith in pg13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults,positive
the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating,positive
however after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u571 my bias is beginning to go away,positive
both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers,positive
even better i didnt think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts,positive
everyone loves surprises,positive
u571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets,positive
this may be true but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal to blow the audiences socks off,positive
set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german uboats u571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship,positive
theres only one problem the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as you guessed it u571,positive
it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors led by an interim captain named tyler matthew mcconaughey to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships,positive
the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear,positive
once the crew gets on the uboat the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down,positive
as soon as the action starts it does not stop and luckily because it is so exciting i didnt want it to stop,positive
this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises from the wonderful heartpounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men make sure you see this at a theater with surroundsound otherwise do not see it all,positive
the best parts of u571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations,positive
throughout the movie several morals or characters are introduced to make tylers job as stressful as possible,positive
germans gun down their own men tylers mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory another sailor erik palladino threatens mutiny,positive
all of these examples and several others increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tylers every move,positive
they also make u571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while,positive
note ordinarily moviereviews org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as spoilers,positive
however being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews org,positive
feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations plot giveaways will appear in the following review,positive
if this bothers you please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now,positive
what does it take to play carnegie hall,positive
practice,positive
it takes two hours for music of the heart to play carnegie hall both figuratively and literally,positive
like the children it portrays the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a showstopping performance at the legendary concert hall,positive
roberta guaspari academy award winner meryl streep has two kids a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean,positive
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school,positive
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors,positive
that is the patternlike plot of this production,positive
ultimately the film chooses a zerosum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an alltime high when the men in her life finally vanish,positive
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful,positive
robertas character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat,positive
also lacking depth is the films bad guy a narrowminded music teacher josh pais who rejects roberta out of principle the movie never explains exactly which principle that is and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around,positive
the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre,positive
they are highlighted by one childs return to robertas class coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be cant be around anymore because my mom said and a glowing concert,positive
not knowing the running time you may expect the credits to role at this point,positive
but they dont,positive
instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent,positive
director wes craven known for his works of horror uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing,positive
one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic but,positive
last night,positive
and robertas two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their fathers absence,positive
the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie,positive
robertas mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype,positive
the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens predictably one of robertas students is gunned down and killed off screen,positive
one thing the film does lack is subtlety,positive
the fact that a little boy was playing we shall overcome on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference,positive
the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience,positive
of course in horror films the foreshadowing and betweentheline moments are meant to be overdone so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game,positive
even with all its flaws music of the heart is a beautiful film,positive
that is not an excuse for the movies poor beginning,positive
but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage,positive
in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history,positive
the performance included a deadon elvis impression robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies,positive
so how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life,positive
he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience,positive
perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santas favorite food this movie has an amazing finale,positive
just look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski change the actors take away the bowling alley add a record store and youve got high fidelity or maybe the other way around since nick hornbys novel high fidelity came first,positive
either way its been done before a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances yet it remains consistently funny,positive
why is this,positive
maybe because you know your life is much better than this you know these guys are more pathetic than you are and you know its ok to laugh at them because theyre fictional,positive
director stephen frears possibly not intentionally has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day,positive
when watching high fidelity expect to laugh at someone elses pain realize what you are laughing at and then laugh again,positive
i laughed at dick todd louiso the shy timorous steve buscemi character of lebowski who seems to know what he is talking about but either cant put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends,positive
i laughed at the john goodman character barry jack black an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons pudgy egotistic and obnoxious at the same time,positive
and i laughed at rob john cusack the jeff bridges type whom the story revolves around,positive
rob is the character easiest to relate to but he is nothing like you at all,positive
he uncontrollably cheats and lies then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman,positive
and like his other miserable friends pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort,positive
he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it,positive
whatever human emotions the clash aretha franklin and bruce springsteen records hold rob and co,positive
grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives,positive
rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in,positive
during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him,positive
but these arent any girlfriends these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob robs incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life,positive
the plot in three words is women and music,positive
the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective,positive
it gives high fidelity a quickly paced informal structure adjectives which perfectly parallel robs own lifestyle,positive
it also helps open the viewers eyes as to how annoying barry is,positive
jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball,positive
just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob who must work with him every day of the week,positive
what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes,positive
john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast consisting of big stars and character actors that really defines rob,positive
now instead of rob just talking to the camera after he explains something the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say,positive
the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesnt end when it should have ended,positive
instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that,positive
also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie,positive
high fidelity is a cheerful old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs,positive
i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen they make everyone look and feel great,positive
the italian hitchcock and acknowledged master of the giallo murdermystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena,positive
this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino jennifer connelly a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects,positive
sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the schools population terrified,positive
a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist donald pleasance leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift,positive
phenomena is an imaginative original thriller,positive
argento creates several sequences of surreal haunting beauty here including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifers beckoning,positive
the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killers identity is genuinely shocking and surprising,positive
the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden exrolling stone bill wyman and argentos favourite outfit goblin,positive
but it gels surprisingly well,positive
the films opening music reccurs several times an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone,positive
argento fans beware the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form retitled as creepers,positive
this deleted nearly half an hour of footage mainly of key dialogue scenes,positive
plot jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy,positive
but one thing leads to another and the next thing you know lis being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working,positive
a lot of asskicking facewhippings gun fights and okay a little more asskicking ensues,positive
critique very cool,positive
now heres a movie that gives you exactly what youre looking for if what youre looking for is kickass action a palpable good cop story line some hardcore stunts and jet li slamdunking everyone in sight,positive
the film also moves fast a mere 95 minutes develops a certain cute chemistry between fonda and li has nice surroundings paris baby and gives us one of the best bad guys that ive seen all year,positive
tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film,positive
he is pure evil,positive
they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man,positive
what a great great monster,positive
my favorite line of tchekys was when li was explaining the whole kiss of the dragon thing to him and he cut him off by saying kiss my ass,positive
pure action movie poetry,positive
anyway other than him jet li also handled his acting pretty well in this film with very little real dialogue to say but enough to make us believe his character,positive
actually just looking into the mans eyes generally tells you a lot,positive
fonda was also pretty good despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time but i still felt kinda bad for her so i guess she did her job okay,positive
but in the end nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances,positive
we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side and this film delivers gangbusters on that front,positive
and yes they have no wirefu in this movie i,positive
say again no,positive
wirework no bullshit stunts with li floating around in midair for over a minute,positive
its all straight action fist to fist boot to face and all around cool stunts,positive
if thats what youre looking for i dont see how you will be disappointed with this film,positive
yes its not very original in plot just take luc bessons own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila does have an annoying hiphoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief rolling their eyes all over the place,positive
but was i entertained,positive
thoroughly,positive
does the film feature more gunplay martial arts and overthetop kills that most recent action flicks,positive
yes again,positive
does this sound interesting to you,positive
well the answer to that question is entirely up to you,positive
one thing that i would definitely recommend is as jet li pointed out himself on his website that you leave the kids at home for this one,positive
in fact you might even wanna leave yourself if you cant handle the more violent of sequences,positive
all in all a rippin roarin fun time,positive
wheres joblo coming from,positive
black mask 510 blade 710 la femme nikita 810 lethal weapon 4 710 the matrix 810 the professional 910 romeo must die 310 rush hour 710 shanghai noon 610,positive
synopsis in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels,positive
there is an overarching galactic united nationstype organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor,positive
within the senate two camps are at odds a bickering isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation,positive
preserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth,positive
manipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a phantom menace,positive
jedi knight quigon jinn liam neeson and his apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor witness an invasion of teenage queen amidalas home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ahmed best,positive
on the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi jar jar and amidala natalie portman attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd,positive
the five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place,positive
can they free amidalas helpless planet,positive
opinion on tv last night i watched young wannabe celebs pay 400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras gushing with testimonials of the phantom menaces greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television,positive
given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace the most anticipated movie of 1999 could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it,positive
does phantom menace match the exaggerated hype,positive
director george lucas answers its only a movie,positive
to me any movie with russiansounding accents for bad guys jamaican accents for good guys and middle easternsounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound,positive
visually star wars episode i the phantom menace 1999 is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at childfriendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue mostly geopolitics is beyond the level of children,positive
it is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation droid origins family lineage the definitions of terms like blockade appeasement federation alliance symbiosis satellitecontrolled robots et cetera,positive
at least this much is clear theres plenty of eye candy and in the last few minutes its good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes,positive
weaknesses weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance,positive
at first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story but then phantom takes an hourlong detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme,positive
this dilutes the central story,positive
additionally smaller scenes seem written self consciously as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie,positive
veteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads,positive
better ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch,positive
strengths on the bright side phantom menace as a bigbudget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures worlds and vehicles appear real,positive
the film boasts sophisticated topoftheline visuals and quality exotic costumes a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone and three worthwhile sequences in the second half,positive
bottom line,positive
seeing the film is entertaining and informative like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots,positive
we are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity music and tieins for the next few months,positive
theres more to a quilt than fabric and threadeach patchwork design has its own unique story or stories to tell,positive
in how to make an american quilt the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse proof we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality,positive
all the sorrows joys longings sufferings and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and as their bittersweet memories are given expression one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future,positive
motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative,positive
the quilting bee consists of seven members sisters gladys ann bancroft and hy ellen burstyn sophia lois smith a woman known for frightening children emma jean simmons the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man constance kate nelligan who has been having an affair with emmas husband anna maya angelou the leader of the group and marianna alfre woodard annas daughter,positive
the project theyre busy with is the wedding quilt for hys granddaughter finn winona ryder who has just become engaged,positive
shes spending the summer with hy and gladys and away from her fiance to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants and whether its better to marry a friend or a lover,positive
one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast,positive
from winona ryder ann bancroft ellen burstyn and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn claire danes and kate capshaw this film is overflowing with realized talent,positive
the performances are good enough in fact to cover up many of the scripts weaknesses,positive
how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable if affecting tale of love across the generationsa sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club with a dash of fried green tomatoes added,positive
there are probably too many characters,positive
so instead of really getting to know a few of them we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives,positive
we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible,positive
there are other episodes as well the love of annas life mariannas soul mate and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friends husband,positive
the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finns story whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger,positive
there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt,positive
the stories are all welltold but its difficult to really connect with the characterstheir moments pass so quickly,positive
while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals our emotional investment is tenuous,positive
there isnt enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way and many of the personalities and relationships feel half formed like a quilt with patches missing,positive
to put it bluntly while i enjoyed watching this film it didnt do much for me,positive
on the whole how to make an american quilt is a nicelyunderstated drama that has a lot to say about love passion and monogamy in relationships,positive
finns segment is by far the most compelling because shes the focal point her actions are shaped by everyone elses experiences,positive
the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees,positive
if theres a disappointment here its that the script doesnt have more resonance but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional,positive
warning if you actually wish to see the film stop reading this and see it,positive
while i dont blow any plot details the more you know about a movie the more disappointing and built up it becomes waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing,positive
but in a nutshell its a good film,positive
star wars episode i the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim,positive
never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world i was more into star trek the next generation it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment the phantom menace,positive
however it cant be ignored,positive
endless toys lining the shelves endless news reports and a multibillion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult,positive
with the level of this hype one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 godzilla which definitely failed to live up to expectations,positive
thankfully the phantom menace does much much better,positive
while the first star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker the prequels backpedal to tell the backstory of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader,positive
without blowing too much of the story the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation and its up to two jedi knights quigon ji played by liam neeson and obiwan kenobi played by ewan mcgreggor to free it,positive
the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat,positive
common complaints range from lack of characterization weak narrative poor direction of actors the dated style and too much focus over special effects,positive
still film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism much of which the average film buff does not care for,positive
hence this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films even with the improvements in the special editions,positive
there are many memorable sequences throughout the film ranging from the fast and furious pod race sequence which is a take on the chariot races in ben hur and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids,positive
utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail,positive
no matter how many times you watch this film you will catch something new,positive
the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks who belongs to a race known as the gungans,positive
best described as an mr bean from the planet naboo he steals the show,positive
unfortunately being that he is a computergenerated character tells a bit about the direction of the actors although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker,positive
with star wars mania at an all time high there is the risk that the film will disappoint i myself had my doubts which this film does have a tendency to do at times,positive
there are a few logic problems with the plot several things are left unchecked and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs,positive
that and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character coming off as a smarmy arrogant brat with such an attitude its no wonder why he turns to the dark side,positive
still it seems that many people especially critics are missing the point,positive
the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that youll blow in your life which is something i wouldnt mind doing again,positive
while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender who really cares,positive
the film is pure fun from beginning to end,positive
and isnt that what really matters,positive
those print and television ads trumpeting that grease is still the word are right on the money,positive
to celebrate its 20th anniversary this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like star wars a welldeserved redcarpet rerelease,positive
thats fantastic especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie didi conn being serenaded by her tellitlikeitis guardian angel frankie avalon,positive
or the hardnosed principal eve arden reminding the student body to be an athletic supporter by rooting for the home team,positive
or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine edd byrnes flirting with marty a pre empty nest dinah manhoff,positive
and these are all probably considered minor moments,positive
a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newtonjohn have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson and their pairing still ranks as one of screendoms most effervescently charming,positive
for those eight of you who arent familiar with the story heres a brief recap greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started but both were wrong,positive
sandy tries to rekindle their relationship but dannys too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his tbird buddies including jeff conaway,positive
so sandy hooks up with a gang herself the pink ladies headed by sassy sexy rizzo stockard channing just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time and danny who still really feels love for her attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back,positive
the drag race finale is yet something of a drag and i never have thought much of greased lightening the films big guy number that choreography ack but grease s flaws amount too few to carp,positive
the movies first showpiece is summer nights where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their funinthesun romance,positive
not only is nights tremendously catchy but its also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes,positive
there has yet to be a liveaction musical sequence that rivals the onetwo punch of youre the one that i want and we go together grease s euphoric cappers,positive
all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller quieter moments the oscarnominated hopelessly devoted to you is a lovely showcase for newtonjohn and channings lamenting ballad there are worse things i could do is one of grease s most unjustly overlooked tunes,positive
the soundtrack is remastered though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of nights and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously panandscannedout choreography but nothing else has changed no computergenerated backgrounds no outtakes or new musical numbers no jabba the hutt cameos,positive
and its a testament to grease s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed its the same allaround blast its always been with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music,positive
to 90s viewers grease will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doowop and poodle skirts,positive
but regardless of what decade it transports us to we can all agree on one thing without a doubt grease is still the word,positive
luckily some people got starship troopers,positive
some people knew it was supposed to be silly,positive
for those of you who didnt how could you miss it,positive
from the very beginning when we see an interactive internetlike promotional video for the armed forces of the future it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly,positive
i guess without blatant oneliners and home alone style slapstick some people just dont recognize such goofy humor,positive
such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned,positive
first thing to do before seeing this movie lighten up,positive
meet the equivalent of beverly hills 90210 meets mighty morphin power rangers,positive
four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces which in the future means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country,positive
johnny rico casper van dien is ready to join the infantry mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez denise richards has enlisted to be a pilot,positive
dizzy flores dina meyer has enlisted as a trooper and its possible shes joining merely to follow rico whom shes always had eyes for,positive
if you saw these three on the street youd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers for never has a movies cast looked so much like the cutout cover of seventeen magazine,positive
the lone nonsupermodel carl jenkins played by doogie howser himself neil patrick harris is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie er carl out of the picture,positive
good call now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters,positive
right off the bat rico becomes the star of the show far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time,positive
but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen leaves rico ready to call it quits,positive
with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home,positive
well sorry rico suave but theres no place like home especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it,positive
thats right the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnidlike alien beings that a can of raid just isnt going to destroy,positive
with a sudden change of heart and clothes rico is back in the game following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs,positive
what starship troopers really is is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on the soap opera like love affairs of high school the love for scifi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group etc nothing is taken seriously,positive
its almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless but with its sly and futuristic approach its not as recognizably so,positive
its a spoof so subtle that many wont recognize the spoofery,positive
if you deem this as sci youre wrong,positive
its sci comedy with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well,positive
gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film but the gore too is meant to be cheesy,positive
yes its graphic but its also brutally phony and thats what makes it such great fun to watch,positive
not since the old mr bill skits on saturday night live has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch,positive
people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated,positive
perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters barbie dolls as young children,positive
with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely its a good chance this is the case whether were fully aware of it or not,positive
starship troopers has its slow parts but its truly an alternative to your typical sci flick or lame juvenile comedy,positive
aside from the intentionally cheesy gore the special effects are quite astounding,positive
when the spaceship passes a meteor its quite an awesome spectacle visually crisp and captivating,positive
if youre looking for brainless fun this is the epitome of your search,positive
a beautiful cast awesome special effects fastpaced action campy acting and a whole lot of gore,positive
this is brainless heaven,positive
just remember not to think,positive
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric,positive
ostensibly the film is a documentary but use of that term requires stretching its meaning,positive
many scenes appear staged and a great deal of cuttingandpasting has been done in the editing room,positive
the cinema verite effect is a conceit genuine spontaneity is at a premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially wouldbe actresses like cindy crawford,positive
director douglas keeve who was mizrahis lover at the time freely admits that he couldnt care less about the truth but was more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion,positive
despite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment,positive
while it sheds only a little light on the behindthescenes world of the fashion industry it presents a fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi,positive
this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study hes funny energetic and eminently quotable,positive
he has unusual views on just about everything from fashion its about women not wanting to look like cows to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style its almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs,positive
unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress,positive
its almost certainly different that anyone would imagine,positive
the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection,positive
in particular unzipped traces mizrahis development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlights a number of prominent models including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista,positive
on the technical side a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped,positive
a variety of film stocks were used super 8 16 mm blackandwhite and 35 mm color,positive
there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audiences perspective while blackandwhite is for the behindthe scenes sequences,positive
nevertheless some viewers will be put off by this treatment,positive
while unzipped isnt an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear,positive
overall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed,positive
when the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes thats beautiful and liberating it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed,positive
in 1998 director brett ratner and his stars jackie chan and chris tucker breathed new life into the buddyaction film genre with the crosscultural rush hour to the tune of about 250 million,positive
you dont mess with success so the team is back again and better in rush hour 2,positive
the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the nonstop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in rush hour that played well to audiences around the world,positive
the formula worked so well in fact that the sequel was inevitable,positive
im never thrilled with the idea of a followup to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations,positive
surprisingly rush hour 2 wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it,positive
the script by jeff nathanson utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film wastes no time getting to the point right from the start,positive
terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong killing two american translators and chief inspector lee jackie chan is handed the job of solving the crime,positive
concurrently his friend james carter chris tucker arrives on the island for some much needed rr and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights,positive
instead lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars,positive
the makers of rush hour 2 are working at a distinct advantage over the original,positive
we the viewer are familiar with the two lead characters and the alreadyexisting chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around,positive
that chemistry was a high point and probably the saving point before and now the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit,positive
little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in rush hour,positive
first and foremost to me in rh2 is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chans artistry in fight choreography,positive
the 47year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and here he does not disappoint,positive
chans use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand such as a trash bucket,positive
his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding on the tail end of a yacht in a hong kong massage parlor and for the finale in a las vegas casino,positive
like harold lloyd or buster keaton chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch,positive
chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop carter who teams again with lee to put down the bad guys,positive
when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case he still looks to have some fun,positive
when lee goes into a karaoke bar the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan john lone and his hoods carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff,positive
the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and with jackie chan has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills,positive
the combo of chans flying feet and fists with tuckers fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the lethal weapon films,positive
the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently,positive
john lone as ricky tan is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign alan king in a walk through performance,positive
lone doesnt chew scenery or make pronouncements to get lee and carter but gives the chief bad guy elegance,positive
zhang ziyi crouching tiger hidden dragon continues to display her martial arts skills as rickys taciturn henchlady hu li who carries on an ongoing battle with carter,positive
carter has a problem through most of the film with hitting a woman but this falls aside with their eventual oneonone melee at the conclusion,positive
roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous and resembles sandra bullock as undercover agent isabella molina she doesnt add much to the equation but is terrific to watch,positive
director ratner and the original rush hour production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera,positive
cinematographer matthew f leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives rh2 the fluid camera movement the genre film needs,positive
production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino,positive
the rest of the techs are of the same high quality,positive
im surprised to even say that rush hour 2 is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies,positive
it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out so far this summer,positive
i give it a b,positive
one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting,positive
the main story is about dr james nookey jim dale who is disliked by his superiors frederick carver head of the hospital kenneth williams and dr ernest stoppidge charles hawtrey who seems to dislike everyone,positive
they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey,positive
carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore joan sims on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there,positive
when nookey arrives at this island he meets gladstone screwer sid james who has lived on the island just about all his life,positive
screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients,positive
dr nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moores financial backing,positive
however nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug,positive
the performances are all very commendable,positive
sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role,positive
kenneth williams as usual plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital,positive
joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey,positive
charles hawtrey plays an outofcharacter role as dr stoppidge the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch,positive
some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters,positive
as a matter of fact hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part,positive
other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again but this part is probably her most boring matron and barbara windsor as nookeys love interest and unofficial womens lib campaigner goldie locks,positive
both jacques and windsor play their parts well,positive
patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell from steptoe and son fame and peter butterworth,positive
the jokes are mostly very funny the story is quite appealing and the regulars seem interested in what theyre doing,positive
although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies it still comes out on top it is the best medical carry on because of the above factors,positive
a mustsee carry on movie,positive
comedy rated pg runs about 1 40 starring john goodman kathy moriarty and a bunch of teenagers directed by joe dante and written by charles hass,positive
summary lawrence woolsley john goodman brings his new horror film mant,positive
to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis,positive
he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town,positive
we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them,positive
quick and easy review i really enjoyed matinee,positive
the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely,positive
unlike many comedies this film tries and succeeds in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh,positive
the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story,positive
the performances of all the principals are right on the mark particularly john goodman as the schlock master,positive
so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours,positive
longer more detailed review beware of spoilers,positive
the primary reason i enjoyed this film was that while being a comedy the film also had an intelligent story to tell,positive
too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh,positive
you watch the movie laugh a lot leave the theatre and take nothing with you,positive
matinee is not like that,positive
i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis,positive
i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film,positive
but most importantly i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters,positive
the comedy of the film centers around goodman his character and the film he brings to key west,positive
i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today,positive
he is highly expressive both physically and vocally,positive
i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink,positive
the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature however while the star goodman is actually not at the center of the film,positive
the movie is really the story of the four teenagers discovering who they are and what they want against a background where at any minute it could all end,positive
i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic,positive
they tried to block it out they tried to escape from the concerns of their world,positive
unfortunately it kept creeping back in particularly with the fear and the chaos of the time,positive
while the comedy centered on goodman and the drama on the teens there was a great deal of overlap,positive
several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light,positive
one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store,positive
if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy but it works here,positive
another reason i like this film is that i like b science fiction movies,positive
one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space,positive
note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies but one of my favorite to see,positive
while mant,positive
never got made many films like it were and mant,positive
serves mostly as dantes homage to the bfilms he loves,positive
so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good humorous story,positive
this isnt a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent wellthought out film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way,positive
enjoy,positive
i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago picking up the grand jury prize at the festival,positive
holocaust comedy receives standing ovation the headlines read,positive
intrigued by this statement i looked up information on the film and found that sure enough life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years,positive
even though the movie was extremely wellreceived by critics and public alike i couldnt help but be disgusted at this notion human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated,positive
only now do i see the error of my ways,positive
after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time it became clear that it is not as the headlines proclaimed a holocaust comedy on the contrary life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps,positive
rather it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation,positive
roberto benigni who also wrote and directed the movie stars as guido orefice a chaplininspired clown and all round jolly guy who as the film opens is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher nicoletta braschi benigni real life spouse,positive
through the course of the first hour or so we see guido striving to get the attention of this beautiful princess as he calls her,positive
employing the magic of laughter the italian comedian wins her heart and together they raise a young boy named giosue child actor giorgio cantarini,positive
life treats them well until hitlers minions rise to power and the family is whisked away to a german camp where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his sons innocence no matter what the sacrifice,positive
granted it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp but it does not pull a hogans heros and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews,positive
somehow it achieves hilarity without disrespecting its gravely serious subject,positive
so weve established that life is beautiful is not a holocaust comedy,positive
but there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me,positive
the film despite critics declarations of it being a triumph of the human spirit is no such thing not in my eyes anyway,positive
some have called the story an affirmation of the beauty of life but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about mans capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy,positive
the films ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting,positive
essentially life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film,positive
however i am not denying the movies greatness,positive
believe me its fantastic,positive
im just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as,positive
but perhaps im reading more into the movie than is really there,positive
maybe the films brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit,positive
in fact maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it,positive
trekkies roger nygards energetic and hilarious documentary brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions,positive
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and nonfans alike,positive
the film generally writes off the trekkies vs trekker polemic as not worth arguing about,positive
the goodspirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable loud giggles yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe,positive
denise crosby who played tasha yar on star trek the next generation serves as the host,positive
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary oed,positive
the oed cites a february 1976 caption in the new yorker as the first recorded usage of the word,positive
unless youve been to the conventions i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans,positive
one pointed out apologetically that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate,positive
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of,positive
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams,positive
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies she wears her uniform every waking hour as many diehard fans do,positive
her claim to fame is that as a juror on the whitewater trial she wore it in court as well,positive
every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcanlike stoicism she says describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession,positive
she doesnt quite understand all of the uproar,positive
im an officer of the federation 24 hours a day she reminds us,positive
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith,positive
along with the laugher the show evokes there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty,positive
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment,positive
few other avocations could give this much satisfaction,positive
these people are having the time of their lives,positive
for the record im not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies,positive
the film interviews the various star trek seriess stars as well as its fans,positive
the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade but over twenty years later the conventions are still going strong,positive
filled with anecdotes the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions,positive
at one the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel,positive
after appearing briefly he drank some water and left,positive
they decided to auction off his halfempty glass joking that it had the q virus,positive
the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too,positive
with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity,positive
not just flitting among people the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies,positive
one guy is a trekkie crossdresser another dresses her cat and then there is the dentist,positive
the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set,positive
he his oral hygienists his receptionist his wife and his kids wear the outfits all of the time,positive
it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home but not his family,positive
for variety he and his family do change characters from time to time,positive
he says his patients like it,positive
well there was this one complainer but he had a problem with his bill anyway,positive
there are summer schools for klingon with ph d linguists to teach the language,positive
hamlet is now available in klingon albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore and they are working on translating the bible,positive
they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs even u s customs,positive
the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the seriess larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns,positive
sandwiched inbetween the levity the switch in tone doesnt work,positive
the incessantly upbeat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator,positive
he fits right in,positive
trekkies runs a breezy 1 26,positive
it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages,positive
on april 12th 1912 the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred,positive
on that fateful night the titanic sunk,positive
now more than 50 years later a film has been made,positive
and what a film that is,positive
james camerons newest movie is a landmark in storytelling emotion and special effects,positive
it starts in the present where bill paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ships wreckage,positive
exploring an old chest paxton comes across a nude drawing of a young woman,positive
the drawing is televised and the woman gloria stuart whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely the ships story is told,positive
leonardo dicaprio stars as jack dawson a young man with a sketch book a heart of gold an intelligent mind and not much else he wins his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game and is the perfect match for rose dewitt bukater kate winslett,positive
she grows to love jack but seems unable to escape the slimy clutches of her arranged fiance cal hockley billy zane,positive
the film takes its time and by doing so makes us care about its characters and shows us the full aspects of human emotion,positive
the leads shine there is no bad performance in fact these do not seems like performances at all but genuine people trapped on the doomed vessel facing certain death,positive
watching this film i was amazed at how vivid and real these situations feel the time rose and jack spend together at a thirdclassparty the naivety that jack feels when he skecthes rose nude the terror felt by all onboard as certain doom turns people into both cowards and heroes,positive
this the most expensive movie ever made 200 million is destined to make its profit back and then some,positive
it also has more emotion and warmth than any other film this year even this decade,positive
it is also yet another first the first 200 million dollar romance and every critic in this country will agree that it was indeed money extremely very,positive
well,positive
spent,positive
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers,positive
be forewarned,positive
floating life australias firstever submission to the academy of motion picture arts sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category its dialogue is in cantonese english and german marks a special accomplishment by clara law,positive
a compelling at times poignant film it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama,positive
floating life centers around a hong kong familys sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong and is divided into clearly defined vignettes each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses which serves to emphasize the films theme of family,positive
the film opens with mr and mrs chan edwin pang cecilia fong sing lee and their two teen sons toby wong toby chan leaving the bustling claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing annie yip in australia,positive
with their spacious immaculatelywhite new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one and with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life killer dogs poisonous spiders dangerous ultraviolet rays a frightening one,positive
this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy,positive
the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone,positive
floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bings domineering of her newlyreunited family setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family,positive
meanwhile elder daughter yen annette shun wah happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter begins to suffer an identity crisis manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under,positive
among the dramatic threads of floating life this is perhaps the most effective and engaging with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch,positive
the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming anthony wong left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia,positive
emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting his is an uncompelling character and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective,positive
his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm which quickly becomes tedious,positive
ms laws film cheerfully embraces melodrama each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldnt help but find reminiscent to wayne wangs acutely unsubtle the joy luck club but despite the directors rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings i couldnt help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and in dramatic terms is certainly the highlight of floating life,positive
floating life at times spreads itself too thin given the myriad of characters involved it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters,positive
however it is a fine film with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie lingching fong and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of nonactors special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee annette shun wah and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar mings girlfriend from vancouver,positive
floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together which are able to withstand great distances and new environments,positive
gothic murdermystery yarns are not a new conceit,positive
in fact theyve been around in books and on film for many many years,positive
without the proper handling they come off as oldfashioned bland and outdated,positive
the gift directed by sam raimi is a triedandtrue effort that surprises very little and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond,positive
its fairly obvious who the killer is in fact i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions,positive
the film ultimately shouldnt work but it does thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other,positive
annie wilson cate blanchett is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown,positive
some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale hilary swank who is severely abused by her husband donnie keanu reeves and buddy cole giovanni ribisi an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares hes been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father,positive
for annie she does not give the readings merely for money but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyones future,positive
her late grandmother rosemary harris told her as a child that it was a gift she was given and she should always remember that,positive
when annies eldest son is involved in a fight at school she meets the niceguy school principal wayne collins greg kinnear whom she finds herself attracted to,positive
but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king katie holmes whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about,positive
at a party with her best friend linda kim dickens annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan gary cole,positive
soon after jessica has disappeared leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale and the pond behind his home,positive
the gift may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level but the performances and tight direction from raimi who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film 1999s for love of the game lift the picture up several notches,positive
slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights the disappearance of jessica at the 30minute mark divulges the movies true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut at times frightening horrormystery,positive
at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett 1999s the talented mr ripley who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a runofthemill protagonist into a very exact downtoearth realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her,positive
blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had,positive
we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing both as a character and an actress,positive
blanchett isnt the only bright performer as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year,positive
in her first role following her oscar win for 1999s boys dont cry hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie who seeks guidance from annie but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all to leave the grossly abusive donnie,positive
as donnie keanu reeves 2000s the watcher makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all,positive
for the oftencriticized reeves whose acting abilities have never been the best this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get and it is also one of the better performances he has given,positive
giovanni ribisi 2000s the boiler room is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad,positive
in the small but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king katie holmes 2000s wonder boys has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn,positive
her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before and she is radiant in her few scenes,positive
finally kim dickens 2000s hollow man makes her usual strong impression as annies spicy best friend linda,positive
the other notable aspect of the gift is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene its almost suffocating,positive
thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent but one that is filled with dread,positive
helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast the gift is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills and offers up a fair share of chills too,positive
it may not be groundbreakingly original but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time,positive
aliens well that is what this movie is about,positive
computer generated aliens,positive
ok the movie is not just about computer generated aliens,positive
its about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib,positive
if one wasnt green and running around the other would not exist as its known,positive
the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits,positive
since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien he simply has to be,positive
well in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft squishy and cuddly kind,positive
just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark,positive
along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way,positive
j well soon to be j a smart ass cop played by will smith runs down what he thinks is a wouldbe villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular,positive
k aims to recruit our poor j but that is not the whole point of this movie,positive
the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge,positive
thats also the main point of this movie protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy,positive
some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty,positive
color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch,positive
the dialogue is witty to say the least,positive
this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie,positive
tommy lee jones as k and will smith as j provide both the action and the comedy beautifully,positive
the characters they play dont seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them,positive
i would have to say that k is more amusing than j but whats one without the other,positive
both roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors,positive
the story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless,positive
altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie,positive
a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor,positive
as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things,positive
the character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didnt need to be,positive
but if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie,positive
especially the evil alien he did need some work,positive
though this could have been worked on the movie was what it proposed to be a rather shallow and witty comedy,positive
that was achieved rather well with some interesting commentary and observations,positive
a movie worth a view but keep in mind what the movie is and if you are not fond of will smiths form of humor then i wouldnt go,positive
originally written after original release,positive
totally rewritten december 26 1997,positive
upon taking a seat at the theater and surveying the crowd i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises,positive
im twentytwo but have been accused of looking sixteen,positive
yet as the film began any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five closeknit yet troubled sisters,positive
director pat oconnor inventing the abbots circle of friends weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss need and the bonds between five sisters,positive
the family is ruled by kate meryl streep an unconsciously strict schoolteacher who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family,positive
there is very little background given to the viewer as we are thrust into a tense but loving home,positive
squabbles take place one after the other caused by years and years of history,positive
perhaps one of the best things about this film is its naturalness,positive
no situation is overwrought and characters react as real people do to real problems,positive
this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play,positive
the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright,positive
what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples both in lughnasa and africa,positive
in fact dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness,positive
legs tap and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster,positive
only after the music stops and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble,positive
in the quiet after the music we muse that its sad that music has to cease and families falter,positive
the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy the narrator of the movie as a young child flying a kite,positive
he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string and the kite floats off farther into the distance,positive
drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained and at another glance mischievous,positive
the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite and kates hold of the family isnt strong enough to hold off the winds of change,positive
as michael stands staring at his kite fly away we hear the adult michael looking back at the season that his world changed forever,positive
the movie is not overpowering but it gives us a beautiful window into the life love and trouble of a household of lonely women,positive
note this is the first movie review ive ever written any responses on it would be greatly appreciated,positive
a common complaint amongst film critics is why arent there more literate scripts available,positive
quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isnt dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content,positive
paul attanasios script takes what could have been a tepid thriller the quiz show scandals of the late 50s and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors,positive
the film is riddled with telling symbols e g,positive
a 58 chrysler a radio announcement of sputnik but is never heavy handed,positive
deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script,positive
redford departs from the usually overlight cable tv quality sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces,positive
quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years,positive
although i was only 4 years old when the twenty one scandal broke enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redfords almost tangible palette,positive
from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without disposable income before the manifestation of its american dream,positive
the film deftly weaves several themes together from assimilation and exclusion of jews from the good life to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his fathers fame,positive
though the 50s audience that is rocked by this scandal may initially seem naive to us they should appear all too familiar with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding,positive
charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day,positive
the tv audience is almost a fourth main character always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf,positive
at the films end the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff,positive
like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret this mirror may reflect an image were not all that comfortable with,positive
there was a huge crowd so many over 100 people could not be admitted at a premiere screening of the nephew first screening with a major general audience admittance,positive
this was a movie premiere at the santa barbara international film festival,positive
pierce brosnan 007 produced his first movie with beau st clair,positive
it was a constantly mindmoving and personal movie with lovely scenes of ireland,positive
chad hill harper beloved is a cute 17 year old mixed race african american and irish nephew whos irish mother died,positive
he comes back to ireland living with the curmudgeon uncle tony egan donal mccann,positive
he meets pierce brosnans character mr obrady or just brady because he falls in love with the beautiful daughter,positive
there are many scenes ah character scenes to laugh at others pull some tears,positive
the three mentioned above were at the premiere in the flesh with the director eugene brady,positive
after the movie they took questions,positive
the movie was very good it not fantastic,positive
the nephew has not been picked up in north america but has been in the rest of the world,positive
the nephew is generation secrecy of a titanic proportion,positive
lets hope the rest of america will be able to see the nephew,positive

its a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesnt need violence to be good or worth watching,positive
all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails,positive
and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermonuclear war,positive
and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon,positive
a computer whizkid david is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades,positive
but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game he wants to be the first to play it,positive
instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad,positive
with the help of jennifer a girl in his biology class he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr war operation plan response a topnotch computer at the time but now hardly faster than my own computer,positive
i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema,positive
it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasnt changed,positive
of course a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983,positive
i wouldnt be surprised if this gave people nightmares,positive
i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon,positive
broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers although her interest in david remains a mystery,positive
but the rest of the actors are by no fault of their own restricted by the script to play onedimensional grownups,positive
davids parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s movies like secret admirer porkys or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr strangelove,positive
if for no other reason you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days,positive
david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers,positive
the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on,positive
far from any 56k modem my guess is that its some kind of 2400 bps modem the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum,positive
the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights just like those you see on star trek or any old sfmovie but its hardly impressing compared with what you can get today,positive
what are the lessons we can learn from wargames,positive
1,positive
make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers,positive
2 thank you whoever it was for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers,positive
director dominic sena who made the highly underrated kalifornia and producer jerry bruckheimer the rock armageddon bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen,positive
nicolas cage plays memphis a retired car thief whos pulled back in to the business by an evil car thief overlord christopher eccleston determined to kill memphis kid brother giovanni ribisi,positive
memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang,positive
memphis sets out to put his old crew back together but discovers that most of them have retired as well,positive
gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits,positive
in that sequence we get a rockin little tune from moby along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects,positive
filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride,positive
and what follows doesnt disappoint,positive
cage turns in one of his good performances here he can easily go either way,positive
good or bad,positive
i dont know how he does that and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely,positive
of the supporting cast members angelina jolie as memphis former love is in the film just to provide eye candy shes definitely the hottest looking grease monkey ive ever seen and robert duvall as memphis former mentor is just around to lend the film some class,positive
also im a big fan of will patton armageddon the postman and would love to see him get a huge role someday,positive
none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately,positive
some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles,positive
delroy lindo get shorty shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis as does timothy olyphant go as lindos partner,positive
i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important,positive
the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion,positive
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll,positive
theres no doubt in anyones mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the rival car thief plot line,positive
as it stands that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package,positive
but if i was making this film id have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew thereby making memphis have to improvise,positive
thereby adding some meat to the plot,positive
the finale is essentially just a big car chase and there just arent ways to make car chases interesting anymore,positive
its all been done,positive
the chase is also shot and edited in that jerry bruckheimer action sequence kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene,positive
sure its a car chase but what exactly are the particulars of it,positive
its very hard to tell,positive
finally theres a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the bus jumping the ramp sequence from speed in the oh i dont think so,positive
department,positive
despite those minor complaints gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment,positive
its not thought provoking but its shiny loud and fun,positive
just what a summer flick should be,positive
pg13,positive
true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle headon which is probably why so few of them do it,positive
even the most religious directors like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms,positive
so its not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get the apostle onto the bigscreen,positive
as a matter of fact even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing and he ended up paying for it with 5 million of his own money,positive
he also wrote the script directed the film and starred as the central character a fiery texas preacher named euliss sonny dewey,positive
few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial technical and creative responsibility singlehandedly and its testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall,positive
and thankfully every bit of that personal investment translates onscreen into power and honest emotion,positive
sonny is an energetic pentecostal preacher who has been speaking actually shouting from behind the pulpit since he was twelve,positive
he spends much of his time traveling about the country evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals,positive
unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers sonny is not a phony or a swindler and the films purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church,positive
duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says although like all humans he has weaknesses,positive
one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that not only does his longsuffering wife jessie farrah fawcett want to leave him for another man in the congregation but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher,positive
faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately his church and his family that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper,positive
at his sons baseball game sonny snaps and smashes his wifes lover in the face with a baseball bat inflicting a wound that may be fatal,positive
not knowing what else to do sonny disappears,positive
he throws away his identification drives his car into a lake and takes a bus to louisiana hoping to start over again,positive
in the tiny mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte sonny once again finds his calling,positive
after befriending a simple auto mechanic walt goggins and tracking down the towns exminister john beasley sonny sets up his own church the one way to heaven temple,positive
rechristening himself as the apostle e f he quickly draws together an eager congregation and together they realize real change in each others lives,positive
but always sonnys past is lurking a step behind him waiting to swallow his progress,positive
duvall has made his intentions in making the apostle clear,positive
in a recent article in newsweek he wrote filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit and when they do it tends to be patronizing full of charlatans and snake handlers,positive
but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe and to portray it in an accurate way,positive
the strength of duvalls convictions turn out to be the strength of his film the apostle always rings true even in the most painful moments because we know hes being sincere with the subject matter,positive
after fifteen years of traveling the country listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual,positive
his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to,positive
ive always called you jesus and youve always called me sonny he says,positive
when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs sonnys mother june carter cash just hangs up on them because she knows theres no sense trying to interrupt him,positive
the main theme to emerge from the apostle is the fact that good can come from any situation,positive
sonnys act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing and duvall never shrinks from that fact,positive
however that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him,positive
in his short time in louisiana he does a world of good and when the police finally show up to take him away he goes quietly knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him,positive
and as a scene during the final credits shows he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment,positive
it is that strength in sonnys character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others he is flawed but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws,positive
weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves,positive
watching duvall onscreen its not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting,positive
as sonny he completely inhabits the character and his performance is certainly the best of the year,positive
because he spent so much time absorbing the traits methods quirks and personalities of real preachers duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human,positive
as a director duvall feels that less is more,positive
his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it with very little intrusion,positive
there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive closeups,positive
duvall knew that the power of the films characters enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly nonprofessional churchgoers and actual ministers didnt need to be artificially enhanced,positive
in this way the apostle almost plays out like a documentary not only in its technical simplicity but more importantly in its sense of reality,positive
the postman delivers but not first class,positive
the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman,positive
warning my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons postapocalypse stories hope in a desperate situation grassroots uprisings and kevin costner,positive
even worse i thought that waterworld was watchable,positive
read the following with those particular grains of salt,positive
its the year 2013 and things have fallen apart,positive
due to a world war in the late nineties the resulting threeyear winter and a devastating plague life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms,positive
although this is the future it looks like a western,positive
as the film opens kevin costner his characters name is never revealed is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company,positive
giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders,positive
running into even worse luck he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem will patton,positive
the ragtag retrofuturistic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the clan,positive
after a brutal boot camp he and you can see this coming a mile away escapes,positive
taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either,positive
once he reaches oregon land of beautiful women bright youngsters and rock and roll he pretends to be a representative from the restored congress of the united states of america,positive
this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants,positive
food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby olivia williams who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile,positive
shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman as costner is referred to for the rest of the film become a reluctant item,positive
although the postman knows hes running a fraud the concept of renewed communications sets the kids imagination afire especially ford lincoln mercury larenz tate his secondincommand and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through,positive
the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists tyranny,positive
the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner,positive
although the movie appeals to my sensibilities there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted,positive
its derivitive of costners own waterworld and clint eastwood westerns,positive
theres little here that we havent seen dozens of times before,positive
the film is often downright corny,positive
a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a brighteyed child is embarrassing in its slowmotion banality,positive
the films final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor,positive
despite the films excessive three hour length several things are never explained,positive
what was the war about,positive
how did civilization change so rapidly,positive
everyone has horses where did all they come from,positive
the law of eights that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film but where,positive
are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasnt made their way west to help or conquer,positive
there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesnt appear to make sense,positive
the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments but beyond that there are some oddities,positive
the evil army is called holnists which sounds coincidentally like the new age holism but why,positive
is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 just one year after many ancient prophesies including the ending of the mayan calendar predict a new world for mankind,positive
why is the general named bethlehem,positive
there seems to be some reason for that but what,positive
sometimes the movie feels like a joke,positive
an army of postal workers armed with guns,positive
considering the headlines of recent years it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys,positive
its even more difficult to accept those repowering the federal government as the heroes,positive
given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government its asking a lot for the audience to get behind the films nationalism,positive
even with its numerous flaws the movie all comes together if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have,positive
its doubtful that the postman is going to find much of an audience but a few of us are going to have a good time,positive
besides were all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug,positive
michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is to the best of his knowledge not him,positive
perhaps this similarlynamed person should have used kevin costners postal service,positive
the happy bastards 30second review,positive
american pie,positive
the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty,positive
if you go expecting dawsons creek youre in for a problem,positive
if your expectations are lower and better i might add you will enjoy the hell out of american pie,positive
the movie casts several unknowns with the only real recognizable one being sctvs own eugene levy as a happygolucky dad,positive
the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out get laid,positive
thats pretty much it,positive
throughout the movie little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout including a memorable scene involving an apple pie i wont give it away but you probably know what it is and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry,positive
of course the movie has some slightly sentimental bits but they dont drag the movies humor content down that bad,positive
most of the actors get their job done but its levy whos a hoot a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious visual aids,positive
i couldnt stop laughing during this movie and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references then american pie is for you,positive
if youre one of those conservative types well ill bet youre having fun at home while this south park and austin powers ii plays in theatres now arent you,positive
underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today,positive
1998s hope floats was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year,positive
we always get films that make big money at the boxoffice but critics and audiences pan on them,positive
this year double jeopardy is one of those films,positive
critics are calling it predictable and worthless audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment,positive
but as i viewed double jeopardy i found that it was a great movie it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart along with heartpounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie,positive
the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons a woman with a seemingly normal life a great loving husband a beautiful son and a great friend,positive
her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted,positive
after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck,positive
of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her,positive
however she isnt immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth twomillion dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money,positive
she pleads notguilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years,positive
while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad which makes libbys heart stop right there,positive
she realizes she must get out and prove that he isnt dead one of her cellmates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again,positive
which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it,positive
after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones,positive
he is a man who has had his share of bad things,positive
while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband leading up to some jawdropping twists that are both predictable and not,positive
whatever happens the film was excellent to me,positive
i found the writing wellwritten as well as the acting was great,positive
ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie,positive
even if you know what is going to happen in the end you dont know how,positive
this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen except you dont know how they are going to make it happen,positive
it could be one way or another it could be this way or that way,positive
the movie is highly stylized and extremely wellmade,positive
it gets most of its power from the two leads ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances,positive
the characters are wellrealized and believable and we feel libbys pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years,positive
even though a lot of critics didnt like the film i loved it,positive
the director took his time making the movie and put a lot of shadowing in the movie,positive
i found it not to be boring at all and its only flaw comes from some predictability,positive
it moved at a fast pace has suspense humor heart and great acting,positive
it earns its right to be a great movie and to me thats what it was,positive
the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made,positive
i know that is very sweeping statement so ill qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of science fiction stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot,positive
2001 a space odyssey is probably a better film but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science,positive
most all other films we normally classify as science fiction or sf are really just fantasy action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting,positive
the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a hightech for 1970 van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town,positive
something bad happens to them,positive
pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight,positive
apparently everyone in the town is dead,positive
the authorities call a wildfire alert summoning four scientists all but one of them somewhat reluctant to a supersecret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada,positive
two of scientists stone and hall fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks their blood turned to powder in their veins,positive
some went insane before they died and two of them a baby and an old wino are miraculously still alive,positive
they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab where stone pressures the white house to call up a directive 712 an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb,positive
what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda an organism that defies all the normal rules of earthlike life and mutates as it grows,positive
their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict,positive
what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the abomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet,positive
they barely call off the bombing in time,positive
but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out,positive
this triggers the labs lastditch defense mechanism an atomic bomb,positive
to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow,positive
much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts,positive
but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw,positive
the performances are universally fine with the actors keeping things lowkey and restrained just like scientists,positive
to me the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting,positive
we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we dont expect,positive
this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it,positive
it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a bodys wrist is slashed spilling its powdered blood,positive
i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory,positive
this was of course a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this,positive
not only did i get to see an advance screening i was able to see an advance screening of a very good movie,positive
the very fastpaced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher a fasttalking witty comical taxi driver in new york city,positive
gibsons performance is terrific and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films,positive
gibson again teams up with richard donner as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick and this time around the combination works even better,positive
the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique,positive
try to imagine a toneddowned version of travis bickle who this time around is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy coverups,positive
if you can imagine that then youve basically got jerry fletcher,positive
in many ways i was surprised by this movie,positive
to begin with i was surprised at how good it was,positive
dont get me wrong its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring but it was a very enjoyable movie,positive
secondly i was surprised at mel gibsons performance,positive
he provided a fantastic performance,positive
the previews of this film led me to believe it was an allout action flick which after viewing it was almost the opposite in a certain sense,positive
gibsons character has an almost uncountable number of oneliners hilarious situations and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film,positive
for instance jerrys apartment and especially his security is memorable,positive
and last i was surprised at how good the plot is,positive
writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story and when watching this film you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers farfetched or so they seem at first conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions,positive
mel gibson isnt the only standout in the film,positive
julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton the department of justice employee who cant seem to stay away from jerry fletcher who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories,positive
he also seems obsessed and in love with her,positive
but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories she shrugs him and his beliefs off continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him,positive
jerry obviously determined to continually seek out the truth continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory which will be printed in his newsletter same title as the movie,positive
although he only has five subscribers he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work and publishes his next edition,positive
very soon after he does so he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr jonas patrick stewart,positive
after barely escaping alive jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust alice sutton,positive
the remainder of the film is almost always fastpaced and full of action and suspense with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy,positive
and more along the way the audience and alice learn more and more about jerrys life,positive
many things are explained throughout this film both to the characters and to the audience,positive
for instance the meaning of the book the catcher in the rye and its ties to assassins the reason lone gunmen have three names e g,positive
lee harvey oswald and james earl ray and the real truth behind the grateful dead,positive
make sure listen closely throughout the film as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above,positive
definitely when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th make sure you are standing in line to see it,positive
i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film especially if you are into an actionthriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations,positive
and even if you arent you should still like this film,positive
armageddon in itself symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking,positive
stories have been replaced with special effects character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up,positive
armageddon is as stupid as loud and as shallow as any movie youll see come out this summer or maybe even any other summer,positive
but i loved every freaking minute of it,positive
believe me im just as shocked as you are,positive
hell i dont even know why i went to see it in the first place,positive
the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year or at least in the running,positive
im sorry but somebody dial 911,positive
isnt quite the tagging thats going to sell a movie,positive
it isnt too wise either to market the film using the movies stupidest lines beam me up scotty yeah that sure is great writing,positive
i mean lets face it armageddons previews rival the truman shows as being some of the worst of the year,positive
neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice,positive
of course you all know the story,positive
when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas nasa calls in the uss top oil drillers to go into space and implant a nuclear device eighthundred and someodd feet into the asteroid,positive
in the coarse of all this mayhem we are introduced to some interesting and not so interesting characters,positive
belonging to the former group is rockhound steve buscemi a horny little womanizing genius whos always full of wisecracks even when flying into space at a huge amount of gs,positive
also theres the always coolashell billy bob thornton as dan truman the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers,positive
he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 only without the intensity and great lines to deliver,positive
then on the flip side of the coin is the tired contrived character of harry stamper bruce willis who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i cant quite place the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie,positive
basically thats about it,positive
as i said this is hardly a film about plot,positive
its another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden,positive
case in point nasa doesnt know that there is even an asteroid on its way until eighteen days before impact huh,positive
another example at one point in the movie two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy,positive
how pretentious is that,positive
want another one,positive
okay before the oil drillers blast off into space one of them starts singing leaving on a jet plane and soon all the rest join in,positive
did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture,positive
but naturally all this sappiness melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin time at the movies,positive
and dont get me wrong despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon i still very much enjoyed it,positive
so even if you dont win one of mcdonalds free tickets its still definitely worth checking out,positive
in daylight sylvester stallone breaks no new ground cinematically speaking but he covers familiar territory quite well,positive
yesterday as i was going about my business in the university bookstore i noticed this stand with these daylight movie posters on it,positive
i had never heard of the movie so i stopped by to check it out,positive
it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering,positive
so i shrugged thought hey they probably wont give me the card anyway and i could always use a free movie so i signed up,positive
all in all i dont think i got that bad of a deal either,positive
rob cohen who has previously brought us such films as dragon the bruce lee story and more recently dragonheart gee i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason,positive
you think now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture with fx by industrial light and magic about the aftereffects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey,positive
sylvester stallone plays kit latura who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in cliffhanger a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed,positive
when the crisis hits he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out,positive
there are other similarities to cliffhanger too perhaps the only real difference is that cliffhanger had a villain where daylights bad guy is mother nature,positive
in fact had the two movies been made in hong kong this might have been titled cliffhanger iiit bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film sequels do to their predecessors,positive
the first halfhour of daylight is setup,positive
subplots are woven and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled,positive
we meet all the important people toxic waste disposal truck drivers a young frustrated jilted rejected playwright a family struggling to stay together an older couple and their dog a truckload of prisoners an ad agency executive a tunnel police officer stallone and others,positive
we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons,positive
and then thirty minutes into the film boom,positive
and its a big one,positive
from there on in its sly stallone to the rescue,positive
and rescue he does enduring batterings beatings falls repeated immersion in 34degree water explosions mud rats and constant setbacks before going on to save the day slystyle,positive
again theres,positive
nothing new here,positive
and yet there doesnt need to be,positive
the fun of daylight is not in the story but in the execution,positive
the specialeffects are firstrate thanks to industrial light and magic and the ensemble cast works well together,positive
once the film hits its stride it carries the viewer right along to the finish with very few jars along the way,positive

i dont box with kid gloves,positive
i dont play nice im not a nice guy and i never ever go easy on a film,positive
i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic,positive
however i do some favors and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery,positive
rigormortis the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking gets several of these points each time,positive
i still however will not go easy on them,positive
they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy which begins quite wittily with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it,positive
in the famous lines of many martyrs i have no regrets,positive
well i do have some regrets but that is not the point in the previous sentence,positive
the point of it was that down with america was a film that from a critical standpoint did not entirely disappoint me,positive
sure the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable,positive
down with america concerns a government agent needless murder and a book containing everything from the unabombers manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report,positive
like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed it displays an offkilter humor and intelligence it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail,positive
the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s,positive
a dying movement from the day they started these paranoid thrillers had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word roswell,positive
in down with america the line roswell is highly absent,positive
with an about ten minute running time down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich that the conspiracy films fell into makes jokes at them at the same time and provides us with funny and memorable characters,positive
again i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldnt care less about,positive
the film as previously stated concerns a federal agent peter roach an obsessed librarian meri stevens a mystery man joe kaczkowski and two people obsessed with silence in the library robb sherman kevin flowers,positive
the plot a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in a public library where it can be viewed by all,positive
from there we go into a delightful parody,positive
the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books,positive
we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast,positive
although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to noname it ends up being the noname people who do a good job delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out,positive
for once i dont have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online,positive
i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of lauto and les xfiles and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself,positive
its almost as much fun as the film,positive
a costume drama set in the 1500s england elizabeth is a lush romantic political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one,positive
when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens the royal family so to speak are upset that a protestant should be crowened and not another catholic plus the new queen elizabeth i cate blanchette was the bastard baby of the previous queen marys father,positive
the persecution over catholics and protestants isnt the only majority in elizabeth,positive
elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures and her lover joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love in order to rule successfully the country which she did for 40 more years,positive
both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era and both feature a queen elizabeth i judi dench plays her in love or course,positive
yet i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i but because i found blanchette a more powerful hypnotic sense for the role,positive
elizabeth also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award,positive
its a dynamic important breathtaking film of loyalty power greed and trust,positive
shakespeare would die for the book rights,positive
mike myers you certainly did throw us a frickin bone here in what you call the biggest austin powers adventure yet,positive
austin powers the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers international man of mystery,positive
many are skeptical about sequels saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original but austin powers tswsm goes beyond the first film,positive
austin powers the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles,positive
he reprises his role as the title character austin powers the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr evil also played by mike myers from destroying the earth,positive
tswsm leaves off where the original stopped with dr evils frischs big boy space capsule floating through space,positive
dr evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 in which he plans to steal austin powers mojo what keeps austin going with spy talents,positive
upon his return to his secret lair which is now a starbucks coffee shop dr evil learns that his evil henchman which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau have created a 18 size clone of dr evil which is later named mini me,positive
the evil mini me replaces scott evil played by seth green as dr evils son in the madmans mind because dr evil thinks of scott to be only quasievil,positive
dr evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him and now he has one,positive
dr evil tells mini me you complete me in a loving manner,positive
dr evil loving,positive
wow,positive
mike myers third role is as fat bastard a scottish henchman of dr evils who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers frozen body,positive
austin powers learns of dr evils trip back into the 60s and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it,positive
once arriving in the year 1967 austin travels to his pad his smashing club where he meets felicity shagwell played by heather graham a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr evil,positive
as the film progresses hilarious one liners are thrown at us mainly by dr evil for example dont go there girlfriend,positive
to the president of the united states,positive
many witty gags take place note the entire tent scene and just plain funny scenes which are so stupid theyre funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes,positive
take for example scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is,positive
the way austin powers tswsm uses its humor is clever throwing a hilarious scene at you followed by five minutes of one liners followed by another outrageous scene so you never stop laughing,positive
there was honestly not one moment in austin powers tswsm where i wasnt laughing,positive
the last film that i laughed so hard in was well austin powers,positive
it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it,positive
the film even makes fun of itself in a line something along the lines of its funny how england and southern california look nothing alike,positive
tswsm was filmed in southern california but was supposed to take place in england,positive
i can tell you one thing he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character which is all over television newspapers magazines and the movie theaters,positive
i believe that dr evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did,positive
dr evil provided more laughs more memorable moments and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film,positive
i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away but from screenplay writer mike myers not fat bastard,positive
also making a great addition to the series is mini me who is played by verne troyer,positive
even though the midget actor is 30 years old he is adorable by dr evils side constantly,positive
the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality such as lack of character development barely any detailed plot characteristics and barely any good acting but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor,positive
mike myers with his three roles acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor disguising himself completely in one of the roles,positive
fat bastard all three characters are different and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them,positive
heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did who gave a very flat performance in the original speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion,positive
speaking of hurley she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments,positive
hopefully graham tags along for future austin powers adventures,positive
the bottom line a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing,positive
notting hills trailer is awful a laughless schmaltzy montage,positive
the movie was desperately marketed to the antiphantom menace crowd the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter,positive
and it apparently worked,positive
perhaps the presence of julia robertswhose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes mehad a lot to do with notting hills opening weekend success but the films staying power is based on word of mouth,positive
allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill,positive
grant stars as william thacker a travelbookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill,positive
into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott roberts,positive
a common thief some spilled orange juice and some stilted conversation leads to their first highly impetuous or is that improbable kiss,positive
days later william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist and so begins a passionate albeit surreptitious affair,positive
aside notting hills portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate,positive
only annas celebrityor williams lack thereofthreatens to drive a wedge between them,positive
richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered and for at least its first halfhour the pictures beauty and the beast like scenario is romantic escapism of the highest order,positive
as with groundhog day or pleasantville while watching the highconcept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines in the lead its williams ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna,positive
curtis who previously penned four weddings and a funeral is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couples situation is not enough to fuel two hours worth of entertainment so some of notting hills finest moments revolve around williams eccentric friends and family,positive
by now dear reader youve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans performance as williams imbecilic welsh flatmate,positive
yes hes a crowd pleaser a walking sight gag but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchairbound and appropriately named bella mckee the anguished waitress of naked or max tom mcinnerny her lousy chef of a husband,positive
in the movies best sequence william anna and company sit around bloated from maxs latest concoction and hold a contest the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life,positive
the scene ends only as a british writer would end it,positive
if anything fantastic bits like these dull the main plots dramatic impact,positive
roberts and grant especially are appealing but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times four weddings suffered similar flaws and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common theyre lonely,positive
worth noting in roberts and grants favour the ubiquitous im just a girl standing across from a boy asking him to love her episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done,positive
notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable on the visual side of things i especially appreciated michells playful changingoftheseasons number,positive
if only and this is a surprisinly minor gripe he had lopped off the egregious epilogue for a story that thrives on what we bring to it the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up leaving our imaginations in the lurch,positive
we run tings,positive
tings dont run we,positive
sound advice from capone paul campbell to his squaddie or partner floyd winston bell,positive
jamaican film shot entirely on video featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woostyled brotherhood morals and a little gunplay,positive
capone a tough as nails super cop gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home while he was with his lady and killed his partner in front of him,positive
when he arrives he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook,positive
capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and much to his disappointment also finds out his childhood friend ratty mark danvers has been helping him,positive
torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again,positive
directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while,positive
shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films although the action isnt as hyperkinetic as most of woos films are,positive
the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though and eventually begin to take on a life of their own beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after,positive
the makeup effects are particularly good in these scenes as well with flawless squib work on display from the effects team,positive
the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue spoken with thick jamaican accents half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang just adds to the interest,positive
paul campbell as the loose cannon capone essays his role perfectly displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times,positive
mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty the parttime gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together,positive
unfortunately carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective largely because his underlings seem to run all over him but then again that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed,positive
the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists sly and robbie who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones maxi priest bob dylan james brown grace jones herbie hancock bootsy collins and carly simon among others,positive
the end credit song we run tings by the group red dragon is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review,positive
oddly enough desmond ballentine who plays the character deportee is well known as a pioneer in the realm of gangsta reggae as the performer ninjaman and he doesnt contribute a single song to the film that i could see which is virtually unheard of here in the us,positive
at the time of this writing third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us coming off of a sixmonth boxoffice breaking run in jamaica where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time bringing in 21 million in jamaica which is roughly 500 000 us,positive
palm pictures the company that released the offbeat but entertaining sixstring samurai is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters,positive
chris blackwell founder of palm pictures was also involved in the production of another jamaican boxoffice smash in 1981 entitled countryman so id say he has a pretty good track record,positive
overall third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo ringo lam tsui hark and many other action films by directors from hong kong,positive
if action films are your thing and you dont mind intermittent subtitles then you cant go wrong with this film,positive
the performances and the story are solid if only a little cliched and the action is tight,positive
im not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like but apparently third world cops honors are well deserved,positive
youve got mail is the very definition of a cute movie,positive
its got cute stars a cute storyline and even cute pets,positive
despite this overwhelming cuteness or maybe because of it i loved youve got mail,positive
i know i know,positive
im supposed to be a film critic,positive
im not supposed to love transparent and formula pictures like this,positive
but darn it somewhere along the way youve got mail reeled me in hook line and sinker,positive
the movie stars tom hanks and meg ryan as two somewhat unhappy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room and quickly become close friends without ever knowing each others identity,positive
as the movie progresses though they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each other,positive
meanwhile in reallife they are bitter competitors,positive
she owns a quaint little childrens bookstore he owns one of those gigantic superbookstores that offer impersonal service and discount prices,positive
while his store threatens to run her store out of business their online relationship grows stronger,positive
youve got mail is as artificial as movies come,positive
everything is nice and happy and by the end all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life,positive
there are no real conflicts no major disappointments no unresolved issues,positive
nevertheless i quite enjoyed it,positive
in fact i cant remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies,positive
i think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it,positive
the fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either,positive
in particular hanks is at his best here turning his charmmeter up to 11,positive
everytime he was on screen he had my full attention,positive
and despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business i was rooting for him,positive
it was good to see hanks back doing what he does best playing the affable everyman,positive
youve got mail certainly wont be winning any awards but as an exercise in pure entertainment its as good as it gets,positive
the happy bastards 30second review,positive
big daddy,positive
happy gilmore as a father,positive
of course,positive
thats the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy a movie thats passable but isnt really considered some of sandlers best work,positive
he doesnt actually play happy gilmore in the movie but a variation of him,positive
hes sonny coufax a man whos living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his onedayaweek gig as a tollbooth man tollbooth willie,positive
his girlfriend kristy swanson is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him,positive
enter a 5year old kid whos mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate jon stewart whos off in china on a business trip,positive
from there coufax basically acts as the kids father teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks,positive
he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker joey lauren adams but somehow he also garners the attention of social services who arent particularly pleased with coufaxs actions as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid,positive
the reason i say its not really sandlers best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie showing some odd feelings that somehow didnt really belong in a sandler vehicle,positive
i mean it fits the movies tone and everything and sandler handles it well but its just oddly placed thats all,positive
fortunately it doesnt destroy the goofy glee path its been following and it still makes you feel good,positive
sandler does a good job here as he does in most of his movies,positive
rob schneider however is irritating as his friend an immigrant delivery boy who cant read,positive
stewart in his minor time on screen is great and adams remains a joy to watch,positive
look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum,positive
hes a hoot,positive
directed by dennis dugan director of happy gilmore the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with,positive
again there are faults but hey everyone needs to get emotional sometimes,positive
david lynchs blue velvet begins and ends with colorful bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town,positive
however what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a strange world of drug dealers sadists and murderers,positive
the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy disturbing film,positive
they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances,positive
odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film its characters its direction and its story,positive
thankfully the obscurity that blue velvet relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable,positive
since its elements are so originally weird you never know what will happen next,positive
this is the main goal of a movie to be spontaneous and surprising,positive
blue velvet miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting,positive
lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling,positive
the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy kyle maclachlan,positive
from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer isabella rossellinia who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping,positive
the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynchs story telling so amazing,positive
maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends,positive
through these multiple stories maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots,positive
lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion,positive
instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times,positive
lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine,positive
however for fans of odd difficult indies blue velvet could be just what they are looking for,positive
it is very hard to discuss blue velvet without discussing the performance of dennis hoppers sadistic frank,positive
most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable,positive
kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role a personality,positive
laura dern was consistently annoying,positive
but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in,positive
his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask,positive
frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon,positive
many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy,positive
just like his villain in speed hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak,positive
this harshness is exactly what frank is so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him even if he theatens you to look away,positive
blue velvet has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again,positive
for this sole reason it is recommended,positive
but also see it to admire lynchs obsession to avoid the norm,positive
even if this film is a little too weird for you its hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it,positive
ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances,positive
for his followup to the academybeloved the english patient he has once again turned to a love story this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong little women,positive
despite some obvious overplotting oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences,positive
the film opens in the mid1800s with parallel storylines in new south wales australia and devon england,positive
as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us lucinda leplastrier cate blanchett is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback,positive
meanwhile half the world away oscar hopkins fiennes has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest,positive
lucinda is fascinated with glass oscar is obsessed with theology,positive
lucinda is rich oscar is poor,positive
lucinda is forward and selfassured oscar is timid and uncertain of himself,positive
yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals the compulsion to gamble whether its on horses dogs cards or the flip of a coin,positive
and fate has decreed that they will one day meet,positive
that day doesnt occur until 45 minutes into the film when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney australia where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help,positive
another of the passengers is lucinda who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newlyacquired glassworks factory,positive
at first their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor but it doesnt take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other,positive
a friendship is born and once they reach australia it develops into something more potent,positive
but oscar is uncertain of lucindas affection and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her,positive
oscar and lucinda isnt beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions,positive
on more than one occasion its apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route,positive
coincidence is a crucial plot device without it this movie cant go anywhere,positive
the voiceover narration never one of my favorite techniques is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments,positive
however without it the final twist which i will not reveal would not be as poignant,positive
yet despite these quibbles i enjoyed oscar and lucinda,positive
storyline faults pale in the light of two such finelyrealized characters,positive
thematically the film is also strong,positive
the unifying motif that everything in life is a gamble is successfully delineated,positive
oscar and lucinda dont just wager their money they bet their hearts minds and souls,positive
a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional strip poker where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared secret passion,positive
oscar does not see gambling as a vice,positive
in fact he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting ones immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith,positive
ralph fiennes who normally plays strong confident men is very much at home as the fumbling insecure oscar,positive
the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is onscreen,positive
as good as fiennes is however he is eclipsed by cate blanchett,positive
the actress who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresfords paradise road is mesmerizing as lucinda,positive
she gives this liberated woman her flash and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles,positive
effective support is provided by ciaran hinds the male lead in jane austens persuasion as lucindas close friend tom wilkinson the full monty as oscars mentor and clive russell as a selfserving adventurer,positive
theres a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence,positive
in fact i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act which has oscar and lucinda together,positive
with the skill of a consummate storyteller she weaves romance friendship passion humor and tragedy together into a complete package,positive
the characters with all of their human foibles and neuroses are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett,positive
so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy,positive
oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer,positive
i can sum up first strike in one word awesome,positive
never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan,positive
for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie hes ever appeared in he should be awarded greatly,positive
the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chans rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well,positive
however first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three for the simple reason that practice makes perfect,positive
his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great,positive
like rumble this film is about the mafia the former kgb,positive
now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men,positive
the trailer for the film sums it up quite well,positive
first strike is actionpacked but the fight scenes are so fast and furious they almost have a witty italianlike humor to them,positive
jackie chan is a regular comedian,positive
well hes no eddie murphy but he can really crack you up,positive
for example he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him as he claims to be the korean 007 thats secret agent james bond,positive
even the plot to this film improved above the others as a sortof twisted nuclearweapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame,positive
but never fear as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident,positive
with some of the most highflying stunts and sidesplitting comedy first strike is a surefire hit thats guaranteed to draw some major worldwide attention,positive
metro ive seen san francisco in movies many times,positive
there was 1994s interview with the vampire and most recently the rock,positive
now yet again san francisco is the setting for this movie,positive
eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd he is their top hostage negotiator and the very best at what he does,positive
when his best friend on the force is killed by joe michael wincott in a terrific performance a psychotic demented jewel thief roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again,positive
meanwhile roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british exgirlfriend veronica while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat whos an expert sniper and marksman michael rappaport,positive
despite the obligatory cop movie scenes does every partner movie have to start the same way,positive
where the sgt,positive
assigns roper a partner roper confronts the sarge etc this film is still one heck of an explosive ride,positive
a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed and boasts some amazing car stunts,positive
eddie murphy shines in this tailormade role and for once his character shows depth and concern,positive
when confronting joe in prison you can feel the anger drip from every word,positive
michael rappaport is basically throwaway,positive
he serves no purpose except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day,positive
typical action escapist fare,positive
michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe,positive
never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously,positive
maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincotts perfectly raspy voice,positive
i dont know,positive
what i do know though is that although metro is basically a typical action retread it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches,positive
the film is a triumph and an entertaining one at that,positive
it doesnt meander or trail off from its main character,positive
an enjoyable two hours metro is enjoyable witty actionpacked and fun and makes for a great action movie thats perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality,positive
i dont know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people but its something i used to wonder about when i was younger,positive
i cant decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat but im pretty sure andrew niccol screenwriter for the truman show has had the same curious thought,positive
the truman show is about a man jim carrey whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public,positive
since birth hes been living in the fictional island town of seahaven fla which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign,positive
all the people in truman burbanks life are actors and the anonymous townfolk paid extras,positive
people watch trumans life 24 hours a day live with no commercial interruptions,positive
revenue comes instead from product placement a staple of contemporary hollywood with trumans friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones,positive
the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else,positive
even if you havent seen the truman show youve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials the trailer and other promotion blitzes,positive
if anything ive written so far is a surprise to you then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news,positive
either way you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it because otherwise youll probably think it sucks,positive
it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror reciting the crucial eat me scene from alive wishing his neighbors a good day afternoon and evening and living in domestic bliss with his wife laura linney,positive
but weird things start happening,positive
a stage light comes falling out of the sky truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father,positive
we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child sailing through a rainstorm,positive
the death was staged by director christof ed harris who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island,positive
similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth not the least of them trumans best friend marlon noah emmerich who assures him hes not in on any conspiracy because the last thing hed ever do is hurt him,positive
as trumans trusting eyes tear over christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else,positive
theres even a daily behindthescenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of trumans existence,positive
the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions,positive
and it all hinges on carrey who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on,positive
hes come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura,positive
most fundamentally its just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a persons life without the person realizing it how they coordinate extras hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors,positive
the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this,positive
sure the most interesting tv genre of the 90s has been reality programming and jerry springers popularity is through the roof but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves,positive
and when news shows use hidden cameras its done in the name of the greater good not entertainment,positive
but merge the two and youve got the truman show,positive
right now its implausible i mean the fcc wont let you say the sword on the air do you think theyd let you broadcast every detail of a mans life to the entire world without his consent,positive
one day though it could happen,positive
and even though it would mean the end of privacy people would eat it up,positive
you know they would,positive
the deep end uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues,positive
alluring attractive blues but also icy and foreboding,positive
after taking in their beauty the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land,positive
the production works that way as well it pulls you in initially as a crisp thoroughlymodern thriller with clipped exchanges between defiantly noncommunicative characters,positive
but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as the deep end gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating,positive
spoiler alert the following reveals the basic storyline,positive
i believe the plot points are incidental because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters but still you should proceed at your own risk,positive
with her husband tom a naval officer often away at sea margaret hall tilda swinton holds down the fort taking care of the children beau jonathan tucker paige tamara hope and dylan jordon dorrance while her fatherinlaw jack peter donat hovers in the background always watching,positive
the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno,positive
it seems that beau her eldest is having an affair with darby reese josh lucas a disreputable sort 12 years his senior,positive
margaret demands that darby leave her son alone only to have the man smirk at her and announce hell be glad to steer clear of beau for 5000,positive
back at home she tries to talk about it all with her son but the kid wont even confirm that hes gay let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend,positive
he does however get attentive when she reveals darbys 5 000 offer even as he maintains his sullen demeanor,positive
late in the evening darby shows up outside tossing pebbles at beaus window like a schoolchild,positive
the two meet by the water at the boathouse where something important happens,positive
i wont reveal what suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not,positive
all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie by the way,positive
within a day or so margarets life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby,positive
he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape once margaret coughs up 50 000,positive
oh whats a mother to do,positive
end spoilers,positive
written directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel suture the deep end is based on elisabeth sanxay holdings 1940s novel the blank wall which was also the source of the 1949 film the reckless moment,positive
ive neither read the book nor seen the movie but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details,positive
in holdings story the scandalous relationship is between an older man and margarets teenage daughter,positive
switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary and it also raises questions about margarets motives,positive
many reviews of the deep end describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son but i wonder,positive
consider this margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home,positive
her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a largerthanlife figure,positive
her fatherinlaw is constantly present almost as if he is monitoring for his son,positive
and when her husband does call margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family,positive
so is margaret a mother who accepts her sons sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him,positive
or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea,positive
you sort it out,positive
regardless the resonance of the deep end comes from two actors,positive
goran visnjic best known from the tv drama er is striking as a blackmailer unlike any youve seen before,positive
he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol chivalry and simmering eroticism,positive
but the star of this show without a doubt is the remarkable tilda swinton,positive
watch the shadings depth resource vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her,positive
days after my second viewing of the deep end i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water,positive
the deep end is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it,positive
wow what a movie,positive
its everything a movie can be funny dramatic interesting weird funny weird and strikingly original,positive
yep that pretty much describes this movie,positive
it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest funniest most original movies i have ever seen,positive
it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often,positive
besides being one of the best films of the year being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever,positive
period,positive
then again there are so many good movies that one cannot pick an all time favorite,positive
john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job in search of a job,positive
his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely unnoticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of,positive
craig finds a job as a file at the 7 floor of a business building you,positive
have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight the 7 floor is just a floor between 7 and 8,positive
he is hired by his 105 year old boss orsen bean to be a filer,positive
in his office he discovers a little door to which was boarded up and hidden,positive
to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovichs mind,positive
fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike,positive
he returns to tell his coworker maxine catherine keener that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovichs mind she doesnt believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind,positive
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all,positive
john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns that we dont know what really happened,positive
john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play,positive
he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast,positive
cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the worlds most prettiest women is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive,positive
she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date,positive
catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage to the master himself,positive
the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever,positive
spike jonze three kings makes his fabulous directing debut and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film,positive
he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie,positive
by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was,positive
the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thoughtprovoking,positive
the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heartwarming,positive
the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles,positive
from cameron diazs appearence to john malkovichs explorations i laughed very hard and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets the funniest,positive
there isnt a slow point in the movie or an overused idea,positive
there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original inventie witty and smart movie ive seen in a long time,positive
i found myself amazed by everything the direction acting writing and the whole idea of the movie,positive
by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesnt want to make movies like this anymore,positive
or why they dont,positive
all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out,positive
this was a surprise hit as was american beauty,positive
being john malkovich is in the top 5 movies of the year and in the top 10 best films ever made,positive
it has something that no other movies playing now has,positive
in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now,positive
i highly recommend being john malkovich and have no doubts you will be disappointed,positive
bruce willis stars as malcolm an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons,positive
the now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife olivia williams from rushmore are celebrating his award shoots malcolm in the stomach then takes his own life,positive
almost nine months later malcolm discovers cole haley joel osment in a brilliant performance another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient,positive
he takes on the childs case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one alienating his wife in the process,positive
he soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead and his life becomes forever turned upside down,positive
although the first hour is very slow the sixth sense turns out to be a very powerful and moving film,positive
i was expecting this film to be mercury rising 2 but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending,positive
youll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll,positive
i must give m night shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written screenplay,positive
the cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is,positive
a lesser cast could have made this film a joke,positive
bruce willis portrays his character perfectly balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully,positive
haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off,positive
toni collette looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriels wedding gives a strong performance as coles mother who is trying to cope with both her sons illness and the passing of her mother,positive
finally olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband whos not around and flirtations with a coworker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end,positive
its a shame that they show coles abilities in the trailer because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same so we already know whats going on before most of the rest of the cast does,positive
in retrospect though the forty minute setup is essential to enjoying the end of the film so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film,positive
im glad that the run of teenstyled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare,positive
films like this the similarly themed stir of echoes and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to 1999,positive
pg13,positive
apocalypse now based on the novel hearts of darkness is an extremely striking gripping and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle,positive
a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an antiwar film,positive
in many ways this debate could go either way,positive
apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made,positive
in addition now film has gone to the extremes that this film does a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years,positive
apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l willard played by martin sheen to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e kurtz a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia,positive
captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with extreme prejudice because he has been deemed a murderer,positive
willard accepts his mission but not while pondering the accusation,positive
accusing someone of murder in this situation is like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 as he puts it,positive
it doesnt make too much sense,positive
escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat,positive
the men are chef frederic forrest chief albert hall lance johnson sam bottoms and mr clean a fifteen yearold laurence fishburne,positive
willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is but they all know it is something big,positive
the men encounter many exciting dangerous and bizarre situations,positive
but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore,positive
kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf,positive
surf,positive
this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson,positive
duvalls portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific and he provides a number of memorable quotes,positive
eventually captain willard encounters colonel kurtzs frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look especially his followers,positive
one of his main followers is a freelance photographer dennis hopper who attempts to convey the situations to willard,positive
but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony,positive
kurtz is actually well aware of willards mission and refers to him as an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill,positive
yet willard is intent on completing his mission no matter what shocking things kurtz does,positive
apocalypse now possibly one of the greatest films ever made is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war,positive
a movie that will hypnotize you with its brilliant cinematography apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war,positive
definitely on the do not miss list,positive
be prepared for a very memorable film,positive
i have to say it,positive
tim burtons retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys,positive
ok thats off my chest,positive
no more monkey puns i promise,positive
seriously though planet of the apes is one riproarin summer outing filled with thrills action adventure wit and bits of funny dare i say monkey business,positive
i know i know i promised,positive
and for those film buffs who are fond of the original burtons version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie,positive
mark wahlberg stars as capt leo davidson a deepspace pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future,positive
he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted captured and sold into slavery,positive
despite being darker than the original burtons film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious,positive
some of the movies flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton an organgrinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed,positive
then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter,positive
the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty one thing you dont want in your house is a human teenager he says,positive
you dont have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement,positive
touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burtons brand,positive
lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simians foot to try righting himself are take your stinking hand off of me you damned dirty human,positive
anyone familiar with the first version of the film will of course recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue,positive
another of burtons injokes is to have charlton heston star of the original play the chimpanzee father of tim roths gen thade,positive
the young chimp goes to visit his dying father,positive
both have one thing in common a hatred of humans,positive
with his dying breath the elder spews out his vile damn them damn them all to hell he says before expiring,positive
that is the famous line hestons taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planets terrible secret,positive
the performances throughout are topnotch,positive
wahlberg plays davidson not as some gungho hero but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home,positive
he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion his only objective being to find a way off this upsidedown planet,positive
this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable,positive
roth is ferocious cunning cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity,positive
he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet,positive
it is a masterful turn,positive
helena bonham carter is ari the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals,positive
hers is a smart compassionate characterization,positive
michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken,positive
a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures,positive
as the battle between apes and humans looms the cowardly limbo pleads cant we all just get along echoing the words of rodney king,positive
much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burtons technical crew especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup,positive
burtons musical collaborator danny elfman provides another fine score though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow,positive
the movies only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original,positive
he comes close but falls short,positive
otherwise planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be an amusement park ride filled with lots of action stunts and a few laughs,positive
this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the prerelease hype,positive
not too many people know who james whale is but its a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies,positive
if we are to believe the semi biographical gods and monsters whale would have wanted it to be that way,positive
this is an insightful haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie,positive
gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whales life because it tracks only the final few days of his life and its probably a better movie for it,positive
its focus is on whales ian mckellen untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone brendan fraser,positive
it begins with whale a fairly talented artist aside from being a director asking boone to sit for him pose for a portrait,positive
at first boone doesnt realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man,positive
when he does discover whales sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid lynn redgrave he is frightened refusing to sit for the guy,positive
but he comes back only to storm out again disgusted with whales locker room talk,positive
boone returns yet another time after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned locker room talk and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening,positive
meanwhile jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago,positive
his ailment leads to desperation and depression which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor,positive
what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan frasers bravura performance up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in blast from the past for example,positive
i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here,positive
this is impressive because his characters dialogue is minimal with mckellan doing most of the talking,positive
that requires fraser to act through body language a difficult skill to master but something he proves capable of doing well,positive
this is not to ignore mckellans oscar nominated turn,positive
he earned that nomination with his touching performance here although at the risk of sounding like a philistine i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination an understated compelling gem,positive
whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield,positive
he rejoiced in being free from it only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people,positive
in the end perhaps it is what killed him the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare,positive
1999 eugene novikov137,positive
if theres one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more,positive
although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively its obvious theres no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater,positive
so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production its a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes,positive
although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for a nothought movie,positive
quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen,positive
the story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema,positive
not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough,positive
kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture,positive
it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite a bit of luck find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named pleasantville,positive
maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudoworld but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times,positive
its not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in a quite unlikely way what life is really like,positive
soon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness,positive
at one end is a soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is a closeminded mayor j t,positive
walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town,positive
fine performances are turned in all around,positive
maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j t,positive
walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance,positive
daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy,positive
for daniels its his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh its a complementary exclamation point on a fine career,positive
also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish,positive
theres not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who dont,positive
time bandits from director terry gilliam is a very different fantasy movie about a group of timetraveling dwarves led by randall david rappaport who have stolen a map of the universe,positive
this map contains time hole that if exploited enable the men to travel back and forth through time,positive
the supreme being of the universe ralph richardson is the former employer of these treasureseeking bandits and he wishes desperately to regain the map,positive
during the travels he appears as a ghostly face demanding that they return the map that they have stolen,positive
but according to randall they are just borrowing it,positive
kevin a young boy who seems quite bored with his life is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room which has a portal for time traveling,positive
he joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang following them on their robberies,positive
their first victim is napoleon ian holm whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding,positive
from here the group travels to the middle ages meeting up with robin hood himself,positive
eventually kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon played by sean connery,positive
kevin accidentally saved the kings life and the king wishes to have kevin as his son,positive
but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic,positive
meanwhile the evil genius david warner is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness attempting to find a way in order to bring the men and the map to him,positive
when randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness which supposedly contains the most fabulous object in the world the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes as he is convinced that they must travel there,positive
once inside the fortress of ultimate darkness it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive,positive
time bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone,positive
with a terrific soundtrack courtesy of george harrison whom also was an executive producer time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic timetraveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone,positive
terry gilliam however does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film although this does not affect the film that greatly,positive
and finally if you liked labyrinth youll love time bandits,positive
the idea at the center of the devils advocate which is thus far one of the three or four best films of 1997 is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph god is a trickster satan is a humanist the last humanist,positive
he appears in many guises and seduces many men and women in his own words vanity by far my favorite sin,positive
al pacino plays this role with relish and gets to chew some delectable lines lemme givya a piece o inside wisdom on god i have a million names as john milton the devil,positive
the main idea that he can appear as anyone in any form in this case a buisness man harkens mainly back to terry gilliams the time bandits,positive
but the film is something else something original,positive
part of what makes it so very good is that it never takes itself too seriously it dabbles with morality vanity death and child abuse but doesnt try to become any profound study of power,positive
this is a marvelous confection cocky funny thought provoking,positive
it is also entertaining,positive
there is no way you could possibly predict the ending it pulls back upon itself drawing purely out of the minds eye,positive
the final shot is more creative more daring more challenging then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coens fargo,positive
the central themes are fascinating sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly and the product that is built around it really wows,positive
its nice to know that things like this are still being made,positive
melvin udall is a heartless man,positive
he spends his days inside of his spacious manhattan apartment writing romance novels,positive
it also seems that melvin will never change,positive
one day he dines ar his favorite restaurant and is a little too mean to his normal waitress the only waittress that will serve him carol played to perfection by a lovely and sexy helen hunt,positive
she threatens not to serve him if he doesnt shut up about her asthmatic son he does shut up,positive
to make matters considerably worse melvin has obsessive compulsive disorder,positive
one day his gay artist neighbor simon greg kinear of talk soup fame in an oscarworthy role s dog threatens to dismiss himself at melvons door,positive
the dog meets the garbage chute,positive
soon simon is sadly beaten by thieveing burglars and ray cuba gooding jr simons agent takes the dog verdell to melvin so that melvin can dogsit him,positive
and through the dog and a rather heartwrenching car trip that involves simon carol and himself melvin learns to emerge from his cantakerous shell,positive
jack nicholson gives yet another oscarcaliber performance as the films cynical lead and is back at work not playing a goofy u s president or a comic book villian but instead playing jack nicjolson and playing him full force,positive
all of this adds up to this years funniest comedy a creative witty and scathing film from james l brooks and brooks gets awardworthy performances from the entire cast,positive
a winner in every aspect and a truly delicious slice of cyncial life,positive
i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding,positive
it contains parts of bringing up baby any film part of the plot of war games cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday elevator shaft action train action and murder,positive
it is cute funny suspenseful a little bit sexy a little bit,positive
one of the bad guys was a surprise,positive
the pace is fast enough there are some action scenes,positive
i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick,positive
julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together,positive
i really identified with the julia roberts character wishful thinking i know but i do have better hair,positive
her hair a very dull dark brown has no color,positive
she could use some highlights,positive
they both do fine with their roles hes a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and shes a hotshot cub reporter with the chicago globe,positive
they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie,positive
i like the one story focus,positive
other actors include charles martin smith as roberts boss olympia dukakis as noltes coworker nora dunn also with the chronicle and marsha mason as a congresswoman,positive
basically this movie is reasonably fun,positive
there is a serious mystery to solve and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery,positive
it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously,positive
i do give successful comedy high marks,positive
in 1912 a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america,positive
this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world and she was,positive
she was also build to be one of the most luxurious and that she was,positive
finally she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not,positive
to get a ticket for this voyage you either spent a lifes savings to get to america to start life anew were part of the upper class and had the money to spare or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson,positive
jack dawson makes the trip and happens to be at the right place at the right time,positive
rose dewitt bukater a first class passenger climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping,positive
thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue and a tale of death and tragedy,positive
this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia,positive
the movie titanic shows what happened maybe not with a 100 degree of accuracy but it still shows it very realisticaly,positive
now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story,positive
it serves as both admirably brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating,positive
this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is but that alone is not enough,positive
the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective,positive
movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency,positive
the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable,positive
the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie,positive
part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast,positive
the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired,positive
the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles,positive
looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they arent acting but are actually the characters in the movie,positive
the casting for the movie could really have been better in my humble opinion that is,positive
one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself,positive
yes you read correctly the ship is a character,positive
how is the titanic a character,positive
you ask well simple a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you,positive
this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this,positive
mr cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense,positive
all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp,positive
now to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards,positive
the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking,positive
in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening if your imagination is good,positive
the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique,positive
the movie will leave you amazed at the effects and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie just humans and an oversized ship,positive
the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes,positive
now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end,positive
the historical value of this movie is quite high and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy for it is extremely well done,positive
the method of telling the story is also good maybe not totally unique but effective none the less,positive
regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at,positive
the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing,positive
if you get the chance to see this movie go,positive
it might not be the best movie in the world,positive
but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it,positive
during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie,positive
in magic town jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a perfect town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only polltakers care about,positive
however as time progresses and he finds himself falling in love with the town and a woman he begins to see that what hes doing is wrong,positive
the plot is standard stuff but thats not important,positive
in a film like this its the calibre of the actors that make or break it,positive
obviously since stewart stars thats practically a nonissue,positive
hes great in the film as usual,positive
theres just something about him that always manages to be endearing even when hes deceiving the town folk,positive
youre always on his side and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition,positive
the film was directed by a longtime frank capra scriptwriter and it shows,positive
this is the type of feelgood picture that capra is famous for,positive
by the time the end shows up on screen everything has been wrapped up very nicely,positive
there are no loose ends and virtually every character gets a happy ending those that deserve one anyway,positive
in this age of cynicism its refreshing to see a movie so upbeat,positive
magic town is a delightfully entertaining motion picture,positive
if you believe all old movies are slowpaced youd be welladvised to check this one out,positive
its an interesting premise,positive
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real,positive
in truth our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains,positive
what we see what we do everything around us is nothing more than a computergenerated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence,positive
our bodies severely atrophied are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet,positive
the scifi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along,positive
the matrix isnt it the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network a sham world the ability to plug ones brain into a computer has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator dark city and a few star trek episodes both classic and next generation,positive
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thoughtprovoking,positive
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo who is plucked out of the artificial world known as the matrix by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computergenerated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines,positive
the groups leader morpheus laurence fishburne has chosen neo because he believes neo is the one who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence,positive
from the beginning of the film we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out,positive
this in a lesser movie would be annoying but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun,positive
what is reality,positive
what is a sham,positive
the film turns our very perception of life on its side,positive
more than once we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality or live a life of relative bliss oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings,positive
as viewers this is intriguing enough so imagine what it would be like for neo,positive
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves,positive
reeves whom ive never really cared for as an actor is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness and little subtlety,positive
he was good in speed for example but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds,positive
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely so much of my expectation was happily for naught,positive
in a couple of places the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature and this is a heavy credit to andy and larry wachowski,positive
i mean since bill and teds excellent adventure what movie could you say really utilized keanu reeves,positive
more interesting than reeves is fishburne whos morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions and convincingly so,positive
very surprising for a scifi movie,positive
fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout as if he always knows what to expect,positive
this helps to further the aura of his characters proficiency and extensive knowledge,positive
hugo weaving as agent smith one of the artificial intelligences antiintruder programs is also good playing his deadpan nononsense kick ass role which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time,positive
unfortunately when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row the nature of his characters speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive,positive
carrieanne moss plays trinity morpheuss number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo,positive
although her character is somewhat inconsistent moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isnt in the picture,positive
there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects,positive
many methods of imagery are employed from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics,positive
of special note is the use of the freeze and turn effect where the entire scene is frozen turned then continued from a new angle,positive
this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semicircle with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends,positive
the motion cameras film the action and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once,positive
place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second,positive
pretty slick,positive
the matrix drips with style,positive
from the clothing to the music to the action were watching an exaggerated version of what were used to,positive
much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film theres a lot of kung fu theres a lot of gunplay,positive
when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion,positive
theres also the element of the japanese action cartoon called anime by aficionados especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects,positive
combined its really like no liveaction film i have ever seen,positive
the film is not without its faults,positive
some of the scenes and ideas are borrowed a little too liberally from other films and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing,positive
some of the lines are also pretty bad in one instance a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying and it wasnt meant to be a joke,positive
however these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action scifi film that for once does more than merely entertain,positive
robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire one with class and style,positive
the film set in old detroit in the year 1991 stars peter weller as murphy a lieutenant on the citys police force,positive
1991s detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor security concepts inc whose employees the cops are threatening to strike,positive
to make matters worse a savage group of copkillers has been terrorizing the city,positive
on murphys first day of duty after his transfer from another precinct these copkillers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one,positive
orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m p a a,positive
after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead s c i,positive
recruits his remains for their new robocop program,positive
using the remains of murphys body as a foundation their scientists build a cyborg made of both flesh and metal,positive
the cyborg robocop is half human murphy and half robot the s c i,positive
engineers have erased murphys memory and replaced it with a computer program or so they think,positive
with his lightning quick reflexes immense strength and impenetrable armor s c i,positive
envisions robocop as an indestructible supercop the solution to detroits problems,positive
the remainder of the plot follows robocops crimefoiling and vengeance on his murderers,positive
as a science fiction actionthriller robocop is extremely effective,positive
dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense shocking gore and spectacular special effects,positive
several sequences in the film such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist are destined to become cultclassics,positive
because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audiencein other words in a movie theater,positive
although the special effects and action are exciting they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre,positive
rather robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society,positive
the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative terrorism board games and television news broadcasts with airheaded anchors,positive
these news broadcasts which are exceptionally clever recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore,positive
the satire in robocop however is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood,positive
1990s america as portrayed in the film may seem far fetched but is in actuality i think only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society,positive
the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd,positive
verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science commentary,positive
unfortunately robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre,positive
the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior the terminator and aliens,positive
robocops main problem aside from its dumb title is that it does not sufficiently develop murphys character,positive
we never learn the degree to which murphy as robocop is human and the degree to which he is a robot,positive
does murphy have any human spirit or free will left or is he merely a computer following a program,positive
the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action,positive
moreover it almost completely ignores the question and tragedy of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine,positive
robocop also contains several bothersome looseends,positive
as you watch robocop you experience deja vu you feel as if you have seen the film before,positive
in many respects robocop is reminiscent of several other films including the terminator return of the jedi and even death wish,positive
however to its credit robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap ripoff,positive
gos is a gloriously slick hip machine,positive
director liman who also photographed go and screenwriter august celebrate the scene in l a preferring to take comedic snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them,positive
after more than ninety minutes of pillpopping tantric sex car chases and attempted murder go even has a happy ending,positive
this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches as go wound down i anticipated an antipillpoppingcasualtantricsexcarchaseattemptedmurder sermon that blessedly didnt arrive,positive
a la tarantinos pulp fiction go is comprised of three separate but related stories,positive
the basics are as follows ronna polley is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough,positive
her coworker simon the improbably named askew is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas,positive
zack mohr and adam wolf are soap opera stars escaping a careerthreatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop fichtner in a drug bust,positive
perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantinos nonlinear masterwork is by now old hat the idfueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me with the exception of that mindreading cat,positive
pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen but we see gos wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last,positive
torontonian polley of the sweet hereafter refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was not pleased with her turn as the illfated cashier,positive
in go she delivers handsdown her best performance to date,positive
heres an overrated actress who agreed to appear on the poster but not support her team at the junket or in interviews this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms polley as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you,positive
if she doesnt want to be the ingenue of the moment she should have said no not go,positive
but i digress,positive
go is a fun film so chipperly depraved one cant help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride,positive
in that sense its a departure from limans last film swingers which at least lectured against selfabsorption in the form of vince vaughans trent and his subtle comeuppance in the storys clever epilogue which has been aped by mcdonalds for their latest commercial,positive
i wish i cared more about gos characters like the techno music they listen to the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous,positive
when the lights came up and stung my eyes it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me,positive
yet entertain me it did,positive
go is light and frothy featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley timothy olyphant scream 2 and especially fichtner whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs,positive
fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers in heat armageddon and others his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go,positive
unlike much of the film fichtner is unpredictable,positive
razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th 1998,positive

you think you know all about vampires believe,positive
me you,positive
know f ck all,positive
with these words we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver played by eileen daly,positive
made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being,positive
so whats an undead girl to do except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible get out her guns seduce a few guys and kill a few people for money and blood,positive
with that out of the way let me say this,positive
this film is bad,positive
this film is really really bad,positive
yet somehow it is strangely enjoyable,positive
with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick buxom babes gore cheesy dialogue and bad acting any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade,positive
still it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film,positive
agreed it might be but is far from being the best vampire flick ever,positive
period,positive
razor blade smile has some rather high production values shown by the nice overall tone to the film,positive
the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating doesnt sleep in a coffin but leaves one next to her computer and sees religion as the opium of the peoples hence immunity to crosses,positive
but aside from that it doesnt stray too far away from horror film conventions,positive
that is unless that is intentional,positive
razor blade smile literally goes for the throat then pumps the wound full of processed cheese,positive
you cant help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle,positive
youll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations to distract two female guards lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number,positive
youll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably,positive
and then theres the sudden twist ending i have enough heart not to give it away,positive
the film refuses to take itself seriously which is a good thing as by the time lilith zips up her skintight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage youve most likely forgotten the main point of the story,positive
but in case you really care shes been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the socalled illuminati and shes leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find,positive
as much as my criticisms this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups,positive
almost destined for cultstatus the films campy cheesy overtones actually work towards the film,positive
while this may not necessarily be the film youd want to be seen watching by yourself it makes for a fun time at the movies,positive
ok lets get one thing straight right away maximum risk is no battleship potemkin although it does have some russians in it but its not too bad really,positive
its the new film from ringo lam the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium jeanclaude van damme who you will recall also starred in john woos maiden hollywood effort hard target,positive
in lams film van damme plays alain moreau a french cop at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians,positive
these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york where i suppose they thought they wouldnt be noticed,positive
this brother mikhail suverov played in his few scenes by well,positive
you know becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi almost the same thing i guess and is killed in france in the movie things happen so fast that you dont have too much time to think about how weird this all is,positive
moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed we wonder the same thing i still do,positive
in little odessa he meets mikhails girlfriend alex natasha henstridge last seen in species who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the miseenscene she has very nice breasts and we get to seen them briefly in this movie it was rated r in the us but is pg here so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do,positive
this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow the fugitive hard target or anything starring arnold but that works to its benefit i think,positive
after all one thing thats been missing from woos hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love well some of us do,positive
movies like this shouldnt be too pretentious and that is part of the problem with some of these other films they try to be too big in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle,positive
maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions but they dont overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative not too much anyway,positive
the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions even if at times they dont make a hell of a lot of sense,positive
in fact one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character a rather overeager new york cabbie frank van keeken from tvs kids in the hall who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story,positive
unfortunately by the time we have come to really get interested in him he well,positive
youll see,positive
the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots,positive
one is a fight in a russian sauna with lots of sweaty muscular male flesh this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others bullets in heads and vodka,positive
another my personal favorite is a fight in a meat packing house featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw,positive
and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood as they trash those quaint french cafes vegetable carts and well french people that we all know in our hearts deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint,positive
of course the movie does have its share of silliness,positive
for example while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what hes getting alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head,positive
in an unnecessarily dramatic moment he apparently is shocked at what he sees at what he has become,positive
but what has he become,positive
a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him,positive
doesnt sound too unreasonable to me considering the genre,positive
but lets face it any time van damme tries to be dramatic he looks silly,positive
so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films,positive
while watching it i was surprised and a little disappointed in the relative lack of pyrotechnics,positive
but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush after the initial excitement theres not much left,positive
although its short on spectacle lams film leaves a better and more lasting impression i think,positive
im more impressed by it now than i was while watching it and to me thats a good sign,positive
go see maximum risk but dont expect a typical hollywood action movie expect a sort of funky hong konghollywood action movie,positive
the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast,positive
a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha,positive
pretty good bring a friend,positive
amazing potent stuff,positive
perfection,positive
see it twice,positive
dr t white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore but we dont hold this against him,positive
historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s,positive
for many critics scholars and most importantly film producers it was a thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of blackandwhite television and noncgi special effects,positive
but in 1995 same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre,positive
and same as in the case of dances with wolves he was awarded for his effort with oscars,positive
the name of the film was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson,positive
the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace 1272 1305,positive
in his time english king edward i longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights,positive
although english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson doesnt care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack,positive
murrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country,positive
through time more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge,positive
but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who wouldnt like to have a simple commoner as a national leader,positive
braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it wouldnt be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann,positive
however even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre,positive
the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism,positive
while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytalelike vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish,positive
this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where handtohand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh blood,positive
compared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays,positive
braveheart also employs humour at the right places not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences but also to underline its downtoearth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics,positive
what makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist,positive
mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as a result character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero,positive
wallace is more than superior to his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side,positive
naturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s,positive
however even those who dont particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her a child,positive
because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes arent as effective as they should be,positive
mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors,positive
most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema,positive
brendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boormans general is also very good as wallaces trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosystricken king john balliol,positive
david oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his consciencestricken character of robert the bruce,positive
women in this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau as onedimensional french princess,positive
catherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on,positive
from the technical point of view the film is also very good,positive
photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen,positive
on the other hand the musical score by james horner employs too much of modernday instruments for period piece set in medieval times,positive
although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism,positive
the main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank s son prince edward played by peter hanly,positive
he is not only presented as a villain but also as one of the less competent in villains camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood,positive
to make things even more obvious good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals,positive
however although the message of this film might look rightwing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century,positive
according to that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing to make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges,positive
this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety,positive
in the end whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre,positive
if this keeps up jane austen sense and sensibility pride and prejudice may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild,positive
yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen,positive
mansfield park is a turn of the century 18th century going on 19th story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties,positive
ten year old fanny price hannah taylorgordon jakob the liar taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle sir thomas bertram harold pinter mojo,positive
spending her days reminded of her lower status she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times,positive
fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful intelligent and engaging heroine quite unlike the original character which ms austen originally penned in her novel,positive
patricia rozema when night is falling is responsible for the textual changes,positive
from a purely dramatic perspective the revision makes perfect sense and improves the films audience appeal,positive
what ms rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms austens own personality by including excerpts from the authors journals giving that dialogue to fanny,positive
the result is a central character that is immediately appealing,positive
as the grown fanny australian actress frances oconnor all about adam does wonderfully textured work,positive
at times ms rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novels more introspective observations,positive
this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms oconnors credit that it works as well as it does,positive
the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one,positive
whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing,positive
fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund jonny lee miller plunkett macleane who appears fond of her as well,positive
his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford embeth davidtz bicentennial man enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry alessandro nivola inventing the abbotts who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny,positive
while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the films appropriately austenlike ending,positive
other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park,positive
the slave trade,positive
there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten,positive
the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust,positive
fannys cousin maria bertram victoria hamilton persuasion is an example of one making a poor match marrying a welltodo fool who is able to make her comfortable but never happy,positive
fannys own mother trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she married for love,positive
fanny given those two terrible examples and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean,positive
the spiritual answer of course lies in the middle of those two extremes,positive
marriage is not a cold calculating decision based upon selfpreservation,positive
neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace,positive
in the purest sense marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one,positive
and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh,positive
matthew 19 5 kjv,positive
love and logic can be combined,positive
gods word contains both,positive
so does a marriage based upon his truth,positive
with his last two films shine and snow falling on cedars australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there and his latest hearts in atlantis is no different,positive
its structure beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle is similar to the green mile which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books,positive
the parallels dont end there either,positive
atlantis was adapted by william goldman who had previously penned the bigscreen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for kings dreamcatcher,positive
even the films content is a bit reminiscent of mile,positive
in fact its the perfect blend of the feelgood 60s nostalgia of stand by me also by king and mystical power hokum of mile,positive
kings atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories but the main focus here is on the first and longest tale called low men in yellow coats the films title comes from the second chapter,positive
its set in 1960 harwich connecticut where 11yearold bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in a boarding house run by his cold selfcentered mother elizabeth hope davis joe goulds secret who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son,positive
bobby spends his time with his two closest friends john sullivan will rothhaar and tomboy carol gerber mika boorem who become something like the kevin paul and winnie of harwich,positive
when a new tenant moves into the vacant room the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan anthony hopkins hannibal a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobbys mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror,positive
ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers,positive
i wont go into what these powers are but theyre considerably toned down from the book and dont involve black stuff flying out of teds mouth a la mile,positive
atlantis presentday setting which bookends the film is based on the novels final chapter titled heavenly shades of night are falling and features david morse in yet another connection to the green mile as a married middleaged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years,positive
atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks cedars which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski the oscarnominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowskis red,positive
the acting is solid from everyone including hopkins who never once makes you think of dr lecter,positive
most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem who both had tiny parts in along came a spider,positive
while i didnt really have much of a problem with goldmans screenplay i do need to point out at least one inconsistency,positive
goldman for those of you who dont read premiere writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody elses films carefully explaining why they all suck make no sense and insult their audiences while somehow failing to mention the crap that hes penned like the generals daughter,positive
its meanspirited but fun to read mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business including michael jackson o j,positive
and robert blake,positive
in atlantis which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back,positive
well hes not and it doesnt make sense,positive
1 41 pg13 for violence and thematic elements,positive
the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes and the greedy trade federation has used its armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo,positive
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboos ruler the young queen amidala natalie portman to sign a treaty giving the federation control,positive
however the galactic republic has sent jedi knights quigon jinn liam neeson and obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade,positive
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi and the first battle begins,positive
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me the love for george lucass trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time,positive
were the fans not the freaks,positive
we wont go dressing up like darth vader although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool and we wont incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations not all the time anyway but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest were throwing down,positive
all right stop looking at me like that,positive
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting,positive
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll,positive
you see the trilogy is not just a set of movies but a religion of sorts to we the faithful disciples and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah,positive
unfortunately it is not our savior,positive
for weeks beforehand i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good stupendously good miraculously good,positive
anything less and itll be the biggest disappointment of the century,positive
i didnt want the doomsaying prophecy to come true really i didnt but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking,positive
character development is virtually nonexistent,positive
with the possible exception of quigon most of the films characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions,positive
none seem very affected by their experiences and few even show any passion at all,positive
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala,positive
jar jars life is saved by quigon early in the film and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh or supposedly so,positive
his speech mannerisms are so cuteified that i couldnt understand a third of what he was saying and the slapstick he performed was just distracting,positive
his head gets caught in an electronic field his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast he describes being in trouble as deep doo doo and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport,positive
therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors,positive
in star wars we had obiwan telling us mos eisley was a wretched hive of scum and villainy,positive
in the phantom menace we get doo doo,positive
the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story a long time ago in a galaxy far far away,positive
this film on the other hand constantly reminds me that its only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience,positive
perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition its kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500like play by play,positive
i liked the pod race it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters,positive
the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction,positive
this aspect coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me,positive
i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all,positive
didnt millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again,positive
didnt the action figures still sell like hotcakes,positive
of course they did and its only poor judgment that allows the mosteagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults,positive
one aspect that will appeal broadly however is the use of special effects,positive
the people at lucass industrial light and magic the worlds premiere effects house outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computergenerated images and reallife footage,positive
some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed especially the shots of a land battle between the federations robot army and jar jars countrymen,positive
the space battles are also impressive although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer,positive
this however is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today,positive
john williams is back of course providing a score for the film as only he can,positive
his music is pervasive throughout as rousing and as dramatic as ever always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately,positive
since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nineepisode story star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four five and six respectively the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar,positive
as a result attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin,positive
it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obiwan for example but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films,positive
one of the new characters is darth maul hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this films release,positive
in spite of the hype darth maul is a character which almost didnt have to be in the film his role is so insignificant,positive
he has maybe three spoken lines believe it or not a second actor voices the character and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean,positive
with that working against him he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment,positive
lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe something which has been prominent throughout,positive
however he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible offering an easy out for storywriting and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a reallife connection,positive
oddly while trying to capitalize on spirituality lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little forceloving parasites in your bodys cells,positive
this only serves to demystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection,positive
dont let me mislead you too far,positive
the phantom menace by most standards is a good film,positive
it contains a lot of visual treats sets the stage for an epic story gives us a bit of excitement here and there and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends,positive
its just that when held up to its predecessors and to not do so would be unrealistic this film simply pales,positive
eight years after its release disney has decided to rerelease the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days and 17 long nights only,positive
coincidentally it was reintroduced to theaters the same day foxs animated film anastasia was released,positive
you know disney they cant deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie so when someone else wants to make a little money they counter with an old masterpiece from their vault and you know what i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox,positive
let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market,positive
they still have hotels on boardwalk and park place,positive
believe it or not today november 25 1997 at 5 05 p m i saw the little mermaid for the first time,positive
it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago when i stayed with one of my moms friends for a couple weeks,positive
they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and over that two week period i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times,positive
by the time i got back home i promised myself id never see the movie,positive
but promises are made to be broken especially when youre looking at a 17day limited engagement,positive
damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games,positive
the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale but its disneyized which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song,positive
it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times,positive
i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells,positive
the heroine of course is ariel voice of jodi benson a 16yearold mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase,positive
she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans,positive
shes also dealing with feelings she hasnt had before which comes when you get scales in places you didnt use to have them about a handsome prince no disney movie would be complete without one,positive
her father king triton of the merpeople strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the savage humans in a condemnation that reads as a notsosubtle analogy about old fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating,positive
whats a king to do though,positive
the girls in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesnt deter her,positive
ariel saves the princes life when a hurricane rises up and just has to meet him,positive
she makes a deal with ursula the sea witch voice of pat carroll,positive
you know shes evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history,positive
she also has octopus tentacles for feet something those dr scholls corn pads will not fix and offers to help ariel out,positive
shell make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever,positive
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple shell fall asleep forever,positive
its a simplistic plot yes but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company,positive
it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons certainly since the 50s,positive
all the elements are there memorable songs like under the sea and kiss the girl cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder an evil villain who still has characterization and charm and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children,positive
the little mermaid is worth a bigscreen ticket in 1997 so hurry up you only have five days left,positive
serving america for more than 125th of a century,positive
this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated,positive
there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywoods most famous celebrities some fabulous animation and a compelling story,positive
this is the best weve seen from disney since beauty and the beast 1996,positive
this film begins an unspecified time following the happilyeverafter conclusion to toy story,positive
in the aftermath of their earlier adventures buzz voice of tim allen and woody voice of tom hanks are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony content with their lives,positive
one day andy broke woodys arm off while playing with him,positive
woody is now officially discarged and worthless left with his nightmares where he lies in a trash can with the other discards,positive
later andys mother decides to have a yard sale and she collects a few old toys from her sons room,positive
since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang woody goes to the rescue leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back,positive
although his mission is successful he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al voice of wayne knight spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale,positive
the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series woodys roundup,positive
if he can acquire woody al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit,positive
so after andys mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy al steals him and its up to the other toys led by buzz to go into the city to save their friend,positive
and so buzz rex voice of wallace shawn hamm voice of john ratzenberger mr potatohead voice of don rickles and slinky voice of jim varney go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys,positive
there are car chases gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis who by the way resembles darth vader,positive
meanwhile woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family a cowgirl named jessie voice of joan cusack a horse named bullseye and a father figure called the prospector voice of kelsey grammar,positive
they offer him another life as a celebrity a toy in a museum in japan,positive
he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while before he grows up and be forgotten or be admired by children for generations,positive
the problem is if woody escapes from als clutches and returns home they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage,positive
a real effort is made in the technical department,positive
the animation is rich and colorful with lots of wonderful details the cinematography is also extremely improved since toy story there are a lot of complicated swings turns and closeups that really make an impression,positive
lighting and filters are used to create a mood as in a surprisingly emotional moment jessies remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy the film contains a lot of inside jokes such as the one about videogames and entertaining parodies on jurassic park and star wars,positive
the film ends with the failed takes the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv,positive
these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film,positive
but what in the end makes toy story 2 a memorable experience is not the jokes its multiple parodies or marvelous animation,positive
it is its heart and emotions the story about the meaning of friendship love and even life itself,positive
it is not difficult to predict that toy story 2 would be a huge economical success but its artistic achievement was unexpected,positive
unexpected because the first film wasnt much more than a demonstration of special effects,positive
but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasnt produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs,positive
but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years,positive
this is a big stepaway from the ancient laws of disneyanimation,positive
off course this is not antz it is not as intelligent this is not a landmark and no masterpiece but i promise that youll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have,positive
whether this is the best animated film of the year i dare not say,positive
my choice would probably be the iron giant but along side with american pie this is the comedy of the year,positive
i almost lost my hopes for disney but toy story 2 proves that disney hasnt lost their ability to entertain,positive
very bad things is the most delightfully morbid film of the year a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldnt help but be won over by the material,positive
the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas,positive
the groomtobe is kyle fisher jon favreau who is about to be married to the controlling weddingobsessed laura cameron diaz,positive
the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd christian slater quiet charles leland orser and brothers michael jeremy piven and family man adam daniel stern,positive
after a wild night of gambling boozing and drugs a stripper carla scott who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room but after a freak accident to everyones terror she is killed,positive
as robert puts it there are two options go to the police and go to prison or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her,positive
after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body robert is forced to kill him as well,positive
okay there is only one option now,positive
you can forget about calling the police he says,positive
by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer most of them are overcome with guilt which sets off an even more elaborate series of event that includes much much more murder doublecrosses and the inevitable wedding from hell,positive
very bad things which is actor peter bergs feature film directing debut is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that theres something about mary wanted to be,positive
it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh original and hilarious even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence gore and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end,positive
the screenplay also written by berg is to put it mildly very funny and courageous,positive
during the second act of the film some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death which was beginning to undermine the humor but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed,positive
the dialogue is edgy and inventive and this film proves that a movie doesnt necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable,positive
theres more fun i think in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts,positive
cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends,positive
diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january,positive
by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger and reciting lines like stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs i couldnt help but crack up at how ballstothewall this film had become,positive
jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original as daniel sterns wife who late in the picture we discover is a tough kickboxer that should not be messed around with,positive
it is at this level that very bad things was so entertaining and surprising,positive
just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky,positive
the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further overthetop,positive
although i enjoyed the film immensely let me make this clear very bad things is not a movie for everyone,positive
it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen it is more violent and bloody than a rrated film usually is and it is offensive,positive
luckily these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a noholdsbarred politically incorrect comedy,positive
the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and safe widereleases coming out lately still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry,positive
titantic writer and director james camerons much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed 200 000 000 epic arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises whether the film is worth it,positive
as a business proposition it seems hard to see how it can ever break even but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful,positive
if youve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure think again,positive
the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the worlds most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers,positive
in either case it is filmmaking at its best,positive
when we entered the press screening my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long,positive
he said no but that the time would go by so fast shed never notice the length,positive
amazingly he was right,positive
titanic is one of the few long films that doesnt suffer because of it,positive
the lush picture filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean,positive
fortune hunter brock lovett bill paxton leads the expedition looking for the worlds most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship known back then as the ship of dreams,positive
the necklaces hundredyearold former owner rose dewitt bukater gloria stuart finds brock to tell him her story,positive
although almost all of the movie happens in flashback one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk,positive
using a computer simulation the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing,positive
after twenty minutes the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage,positive
in a classic movie theme the two parts of the ship first class and steerage thirdclass exist in sharp contrast,positive
the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing,positive
entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance cal hockley played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane,positive
and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class,positive
even with her own promenade deck rose feels trapped on the ship what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes,positive
in contrast jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board,positive
after jack saves rose from committing suicide they start a brief but impassioned love affair,positive
never tawdry and rarely explicit their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story,positive
leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma,positive
in so many ways small and large he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part,positive
when he confronts cal for example he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cals supercilious putdowns,positive
kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose,positive
the chemistry between these two academy award nominees him for whats eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility is nothing short of astonishing,positive
from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ships bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances,positive
if the film breaks after an hour and a half which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up you will still get one of the best films of the year,positive
peter lamonts sets are more than authentic,positive
one scene for example starts with the planningtoretire captain played with insouciance by bernard hill having his tea on deck,positive
it then shifts to the ships massive gears and then to the brighthot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals,positive
the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner,positive
easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest,positive
at first since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull not some big gaping hole the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else,positive
what a lark,positive
weve struck an iceberg,positive
now lets get back to our brandy and cigars,positive
the ships musicians play like troopers through it all even after the panic sets in,positive
after all they see it as their duty to calm the passengers,positive
when the musicians are about to die they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together and they mean it,positive
their civility borders on insanity but it is touching nevertheless,positive
the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface,positive
there are more than enough characters to love and to hate and all of the casting is deadon,positive
special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable,positive
in titanic for which he created a ninetenths scale model of the entire ship cameron strove for accuracy at all costs,positive
the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two and the front section becomes vertical in the water,positive
people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately,positive
besides being romantic and dramatic the script includes liberal doses of humor,positive
from the many deliciously subtle verbal putdowns to the physical comedy as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears,positive
its goodbye for a little while a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first,positive
this boats for mommies and children,positive
therell be a boat in a little while for daddies,positive
basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats it made the decks look too crowded otherwise,positive
perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheims onboard the ship,positive
in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew,positive
no thanks the elegantly attired guggenheim replies,positive
were dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen,positive
but we would like a brandy,positive
titanic runs 3 14,positive
it is rated pg13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up,positive
life is beautiful is a rare treat a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful or even worse humorless,positive
it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce stirs in a little poignancy and ends up a very enjoyable movie,positive
its an italian film but dont let that discourage you,positive
subtitlephobes will be missing a wonderful experience,positive
life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy with the clownish but good natured guido roberto benigni arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle,positive
the year is 1939 and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams dora nicoletta braschi,positive
their romance seems to be picture perfect with only one stumbling block shes already engaged to another man,positive
can guido overcome the odds and win his girl,positive
what do you think,positive
however five years later things have taken a turn for the worse in italy,positive
the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue giorgio cantarini who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp,positive
unable to protect his boy in any other way guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp,positive
he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game with points awarded for such tasks as hiding being brave and being very very quiet,positive
as you can tell from the description life is beautiful has two very different tones but manages to excel at both of them,positive
as a romantic comedy it is sweet and funny,positive
as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair it is touching,positive
roberto benignis work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplins and it is easy to see why,positive
he is able to run the gamut of comic expression from slapstick to farce with a warmhearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden heros triumph of the underdog spirit,positive
life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust,positive
however it is able to successfully navigate the minefield without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears,positive
with life is beautiful benigni has created a triumphant but bittersweet comedy,positive
its quite simply one of the most enjoyable times ive had at the movies this year,positive
say any of you know how to madison,positive
brad asshole majors barry bostwick shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show,positive
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend,positive
in the early 70s stage actor turned firsttime playwright richard obrien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy bmovies he had grown up with as a child set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design,positive
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england,positive
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later in october of 1974,positive
the film version now titled the rocky horror picture show was released in 1975,positive
and immediately tanked at the box office,positive
whether it was because fox wasnt quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didnt quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop,positive
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters,positive
a year later something entirely strange and magical happened,positive
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country and it was then that a whole new audience found the film,positive
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played yelling rude comments at the screen and just generally having a good time,positive
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture shows life as the ultimate cult film was born,positive
for the virgins out there who are unaware the plot centers around a loving couple brad majors barry bostwick and janet weiss susan sarandon who come from a small town called denton,positive
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed,positive
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting dr everett scott jonathan adams who played the narrator in the original stage version but their car gets a flat on the way to his home,positive
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance,positive
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual in the galaxy of transylvania who are lead by the eccentric fishnetstocking wearing mad scientist dr franknfurter tim curry,positive
franknfurter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky peter hinwood,positive
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of franknfurters mad schemes,positive
little do any of them know that the doctors handyman riffraff original author richard obrien and domestic magenta patricia quinn are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth,positive
going back and revisiting this film after ten years 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has,positive
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release i dont think i would have known what to make of it either,positive
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie though bad in a really good sort of way but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film,positive
by the time the credits role it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters and one really gets the feeling that richard obrien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy bmovies his film is based on,positive
when i say that the walltowall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that once you hear them they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity,positive
it goes without saying that the time warp is the most popular song in the film,positive
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song,positive
what those who havent seen the movie dont know though is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment,positive
my personal favorite is over at the frankenstein place but dammit janet is also maddeningly catchy,positive
tim currys vocals on the rocking tune sweet transvestite need to be heard to be believed,positive
the finale of the film a big floor show staged by franknfurter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets including barry bostwick,positive
frightening features no less than four songs rose tint my world dont dream it wild and untamed thing and im going home all of which are immensely singable,positive
the films true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though,positive
despite the catchiness of the songs this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadnt have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show,positive
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans unless you dont mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place,positive
note director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film in the form of a sequel resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment which picks up with brad and janet this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton,positive
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager also played by de young who wishes to claim janet as his own,positive
obrien returned as a on the project as did quinn campbell and gray in performance capacity only but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original,positive
25 years later this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world,positive
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans a brand new special edition 2disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary,positive
if you are one of those people who cant get enough of the film this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites,positive
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that itll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all,positive
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 85 1 enhanced for 16x9 televisions,positive
the film is presented in two different versions the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called superheroes,positive
for ambitious viewers the disc also includes a hidden version located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen,positive
originally the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz with the first half of the it seen in black and white and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number,positive
most reports including a documentary on the disc say that the color was supposed to appear when franknfurter first shows up in the elevator but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced,positive
the film contains a commentary track by show creator and faithful handyman richard obrien and costar patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and halfnaked on freezing cold sets which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews,positive
the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore and there are quite a few,positive
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments,positive
the first feature and the most simple is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is,positive
the second feature is an audience participation track which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show,positive
most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter,positive
the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd where a pair of lips will appear onscreen during certain scenes of the film mostly during the musical numbers that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote,positive
when selected you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world,positive
once the segment is over you are deposited right back into the film where you left off,positive
the first disc also contains a few dvdrom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player,positive
there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation a video jukebox a you dont know jackstyled trivia game which is about as bare bones a you dont know jack parody as it can be and a bizarre madlibs styled word game known as riffraffs story lab,positive
links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvdrom portion of the disc,positive
the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras,positive
former literock video channel turned music historians vh1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the behind the music rocky horror special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here as well as a popup video for the meat loafsung hot patootie,positive
the behind the music segments are all very interesting especially richard obriens jaunt through the castle which is now a hotel where the film was originally shot,positive
there are also extensions of the sarandon bostwick quinn obrien and meat loaf interviews,positive
as far as extras for the film itself go there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here,positive
one of which is just the superheroes number available in the uk version but there is also another rare musical number presented here called once in a while,positive
a series of alternate takes are also presented here but none of them are really much of a revelation except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwicks pants,positive
for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here,positive
rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show two theatrical trailers proclaiming that the film is a different sort of jaws a still gallery and two singalongs for toucha toucha touch me and sweet transvestite,positive
foxs special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives youre lucky,positive
im lucky,positive
hes lucky,positive
were all lucky,positive
its not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u s but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format,positive
as with their excellent dvds of the abyss fight club independence day and the sound of music fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want,positive
i raise a toast to them cue the throwing of the bread as i cut out the lights sit back and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about bmovie tradition,positive
r,positive
when quentin tarantino made pulp fiction he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time,positive
but before you send me hatemail for not giving that title to citizen kane hear me out,positive
much like citizen kane pulp fiction has changed movie making forever,positive
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact,positive
pulp fiction has actually ushered in a new era of film making,positive
it has altered the way films will be viewed,positive
fiction has spawned so many imitations ive lost count,positive
sure some have been excellent bound and the usual suspects spring immediately to mind but any serious moviegoer recognizes pulp fiction as the original neonoir of the 90s,positive
in this review i hope to change all the peoples minds who have criticized it for its excessive profanity and violence which by the way isnt really that graphic,positive
the most brilliant aspect of tarantinos masterpiece is the screenplay,positive
it is filled with so much classic dialogue the quarter pounder with cheese speech will go down in history it should be required reading for any film student if it isnt already,positive
the story told in unorthodox nonlinear format centers around three main episodes all of which eventually intertwine,positive
the first titled vincent vega and marcellus wallaces wife deals with a very loaded john travolta i forgot to mention the cool heroin shootup sequence taking mia wallace a starmaking performance by uma thurman his bosses wife out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slims,positive
they talk for a while with the occasional uncomfortable silence mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror,positive
after giving marcellus new bride a foot massage he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse giving him a speech impediment,positive
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic you never can tell,positive
i wont reveal the rest of the story but ill definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night despite the cool trophy they win,positive
the second story the least of the three but still four stars stars bruce willis proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the die hard flicks as boxer butch coolidge,positive
previously in the film like i said its told in nonlinear form he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match,positive
as it turns out he not only doesnt take the fall but he ends up actually killing his opponent,positive
he takes a cab to his halfwitted girlfriends apartment and to make a long story short ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flashback sequence,positive
on his way home he bumps into literally marcellus,positive
the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers which results in the infamous gimp scene which is very reminicent of the squeal like a pig,positive
scene from deliverance,positive
the last and best in my opinion of the episodes features john travolta again and samuel l jackson in the best performance of any supporting actor ever as two slightly offkilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car,positive
they seek help with a friend of jacksons played by the qman himself desperately in need of a stress ball,positive
they end up calling a cleaner of sorts played by the god among men harvey keitel to help them out,positive
in the end the story brilliantly loops around itself actually ending where it began,positive
if you havent already seen the film or even if you have for that matter i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition,positive
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen,positive
earlier today i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago,positive
what the panandscan did to this movie is inexcusable,positive
that version cut out like half the movie,positive
what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing,positive
for instance when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses,positive
this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place,positive
just a theory,positive
one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies i e,positive
psycho kiss me deadly deliverance etc,positive
but why shouldnt he,positive
its not like he outright and blatantly stole,positive
give the guy a break,positive
in case you havent already noticed i believe pulp fiction is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time up there with such greats as casablanca and the godfather,positive
trust me you will not see a better film come out of the 90s,positive
and besides its one hell of a ride,positive
note if anyone knows how i could get a bad motherfucker wallet please email me,positive
any help would be greatly appreciated,positive
no i did not read the novel by thomas hardy jude the obscure his final novel final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again see i did do some research on it about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life,positive
but after watching the movie i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is,positive
jude is a satirical film from start to finish about societys way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system but whats remarkable is how timeless this film is,positive
the film takes place in the late 19th century or early 20th wasnt really sure but its story could even be retold today in modern form although itd be kinda different a given,positive
it tells the story of jude christopher eccleston the psychotic accountant from shallow grave a simple dimwitted young man with big dreams,positive
in its bleak foreboding opening shot in grainy black and white he gets a lesson from phillotson liam cunningham his teacher as they stand upon a mountain looking upon a city in the distance he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world,positive
after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella rachel griffiths because they frolicked in the hay literally but did not ultimately share anything in common he moves away to a town with a giant university with a chance to learn more and get ahead in life,positive
taking a welding job he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars reciting latin over and over again and training himself,positive
but when he sends his application for the school in he is bluntly told to just remain a worker,positive
another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there sue kate winslet his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher,positive
she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job for none other than phillotson at the local school there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business nudge nudge,positive
several twists turn in the storyline and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business an interesting scene to say the least and are soon born into a controversial nonwedlock as she eventually gives birth to their baby and jude inherits his son from arabella who turns up again after awhile,positive
because they arent married and because theyre cousins they run into problems with every place they go to carrying around two children everywhere and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time then moving on,positive
if you didnt think this was harsh enough wait till you see what happens later on,positive
the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world,positive
he will never gain any true happiness and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life,positive
part of it is his fault hes too optimistic and too gullible,positive
but society has a way of taking these people and hurting them until their death,positive
the ending of jude is bleak because it has to be although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse guess ill have to read it now,positive
jude offers a satirical view on societys cruelties but shows no way of curing this and thank heavens it doesnt,positive
theres no way to relinquish the selfishness of society and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem,positive
satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain peoples minds and thats what jude is,positive
sure its one hell of a downer but it needs to be,positive
the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads and some good supporting work along with it,positive
christopher eccleston slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression plays jude wonderfully sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face and making him kind of childlike at other times,positive
kate winslet in a pre titanic performance is brilliant nailing every psyche of her character and creating someone whos troubled but very seductive with her personality,positive
kate may be the best actress in her age group if you dont believe me see titanic branaghs hamlet sense and sensibility and heavenly creatures the latter one being my favorite performance of hers,positive
in the supporting roles liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher exposing all his bad parts but ultimately being a pretty good person and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as judes wife whom he never divorces,positive
jude moves at a very slow pace and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists which would drive some people nuts,positive
but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films no matter how slow or downright depressing they are this one is both will appreciate jude though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it,positive
in these days of overlong movies meet joe black the thin red line the mask of zorro it is a shame that films like waking ned devine cant be longer than a paltry 90 minutes,positive
this is just a cute movie even through its mildly risque subject matter,positive
old friends jackie bannen and michael kelley try to find the lottery winner they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings,positive
through process of elimination they find that it must be lovable old ned devine who they find sitting in front of his tv clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand,positive
what results is thuroughly amusing as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong and that they could really benefit,positive
after all old ned wont miss it,positive
rather than divulge the later twists and turns ill stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage,positive
bannen and kelly are a perfect pair,positive
one slightly stout the other as thin as a rail,positive
both getting on in years they make such a cute pair of old codgers,positive
waking ned devine may even be seen as a full monty for the geriatric set especially since kelly gets buffo for one amusing scene,positive
waking ned devine is by no means perfect but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films,positive
the performances by everyone in the town are great particularly the two leads,positive
there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary but it hardly ruins the picture,positive
kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters,positive
scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm not the exception,positive
perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more,positive
had i held off on my years list for another day waking ned devine officially released in late november of 98 surely would have graced the short group of the years finest films,positive
it is light but thought provoking and sweet,positive
i cant think of anyone who shouldnt see or wouldnt enjoy this film,positive
ingredients little orphan boy rural grandparents mountains native american lore,positive
synopsis in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma the self recollections of an unseen narrator focus on his world view as a tennessee orphan boy learning of his heritage through his grandparents,positive
the setting is after the first world war during the great depression years,positive
a nineyearold orphan named little tree joseph ashton is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa james cromwell and his native american grandma tantoo cardinal in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee,positive
here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise,positive
everything is miraculous to a child,positive
but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u s government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress pray speak and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment,positive
through his childhood experiences little tree learns lessons about love race life death people nature and folk wisdom,positive
opinion this excellent excellent family movie,positive
it is one of those priceless screen gems that nobody knows about because its not highly advertised,positive
you wont find any formula schlock cutesy characters canned spirituality sequel teasers or commercial tie ins but you will find the education of little tree to be a refreshing impeccably acted original wonderful and touching film,positive
take the whole family and bring a box of tissues for the tearjerkers,positive
this ones as good as old yeller,positive
as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences,positive
you know the type his shirt is always shredded his face always scarred he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a to kill list for his enemies,positive
oscarhungry producer roland emmerich did not intend to but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century,positive
as gibson delivers lines like before this war is over i am going to kill you schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind,positive
oddly enough the patriot is as much an epic threehourtearfest like gladiator as it is a ninetyminute guilty pleasure,positive
at times absorbing at others enjoyably insipid this is good bloody summer fun,positive
i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend,positive
some of the images are so zealously americanized the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it,positive
like emmerichs id4 this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all,positive
sure its predictable and melodramatic but for a moment after leaving the theater i was dumbfounded with patriotism,positive
and isnt that the point of the patriot,positive
gibson plays benjamin martin the lionized french and indian war veteran who at the beginning of the film is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away,positive
he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants not slaves,positive
as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields,positive
but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel jason isaacs martin quickly decides to save the day or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich,positive
forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war martin becomes the number one target of the british army,positive
the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right,positive
every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis tom wilkinson face was priceless entertainment,positive
and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time a final battle is inevitable,positive
as for the numerous battle scenes they are expertly done,positive
clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating,positive
you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period,positive
everything is performed in an orderly but still quite gory fashion one side shoots then the other side then the remaining soldiers charge,positive
its organized strategic and according to martin ineffective,positive
there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martins takenoprisoners method,positive
what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington,positive
played wonderfully by jason isaacs tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians who nervously avoid eye contact,positive
this character is viciously evil he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home even his eyes are evil,positive
his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as cowardly and sadistic,positive
i disagree with this accusation,positive
tavington does not represent his country his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general,positive
besides tavington the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized,positive
and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys,positive
heck why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys,positive
the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks,positive
with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down its a lethal weapon for the colonial times,positive
god bless america,positive
and god bless the patriot,positive
by phil curtolo mel gibson braveheart gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howards ransom,positive
gibson plays tom mullen a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath played by gary sinise forrest gump and his band of lowlife thugs kidnap his only son for 2 million,positive
tom and his wife kate played by rene russo tin cup were instructed not to inform the police but they contacted the fbi,positive
minutes later an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo broken arrow are in toms house and wiring every phone,positive
the plot sounds average just like most other kidnap movies that youve already seen and it was nothing more than that,positive
that is until about halfway through the movie,positive
suddenly tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying this is your ransom,positive
but this is as close as you will ever get to it,positive
instead i am offering this money as a reward on your head dead or alive,positive
at this point the plot thickened and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspensefilled action film with great stunts,positive
the last half of the film is very well done,positive
another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie,positive
owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones,positive
before this movie sinise played mostly good guys first in of mice men then in forrest gump and most recently in apollo 13,positive
but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a copgonebad,positive
gibson of course was just being gibson in an oscarworthy performance,positive
although most of the scenes were quite predictable ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film,positive
i know that funnest isnt a word,positive
fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective,positive
but thats the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run,positive
no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ive ever seen,positive
so to hell with websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while,positive
i cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner,positive
the chickens at tweedys farm are up to something,positive
living in a concentration camplike atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box,positive
one night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer,positive
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for a pieselling plan,positive
she orders a huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out,positive
what sort of pies,positive
chicken pies of course,positive
codirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave,positive
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures,positive
part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new,positive
the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories,positive
but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived,positive
now teaming with codirector peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run,positive
the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement,positive
thing is the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done,positive
part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens,positive
park and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is,positive
but theyre chickens so its funny to us,positive
another thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing,positive
there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17,positive
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom,positive
theres even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history,positive
the braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it,positive
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution,positive
consider this since july of last year ive seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online,positive
out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome,positive
why,positive
because once you got past the thought that theyre parodying that8216 blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose,positive
they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing,positive
conversely chicken run doesnt lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene,positive
if youve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun,positive
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character,positive
park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either,positive
enjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history but if youve got it chicken run is that much richer,positive
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them,positive
ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it,positive
she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer,positive
the characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived but sweet,positive
poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help,positive
jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence,positive
they even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma,positive
one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise,positive
the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens,positive
the animation is firstrate,positive
remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is,positive
this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail,positive
as in such topnotch family fare as a bugs life or toy story 2 chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame,positive
certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details,positive
anyway the movies just a boatload of fun,positive
funnest damn movie ive seen all year,positive
imagine this scenario you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long excruciating crosscountry car trips far from the city and into the deserted rural routes,positive
so far the trip is idyllic when abruptly your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere,positive
it is not an easy situation but a perfectly plausible one the panorama in which breakdown musters its throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness,positive
it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays but breakdown doesnt bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful titillating climax that by its finale engrosses a viewer with total absorption,positive
the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988s the vanishing,positive
kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job,positive
when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver who later will be an important player in the plot department,positive
minutes later after that their brand new strikingly red jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops,positive
jeff cannot detect the cars problem so he allows amy to take a ride with red j,positive
t walsh a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town where jeff will meet her at a local diner,positive
it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudosuspenser but instead it opts for maximum fervor,positive
jeff manages to restart the car himself but when he arrives at the diner she is nowhere in sight,positive
disconcerted the coffee shops bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife a town about twenty miles from here,positive
there trouble arises,positive
and i shall not reveal anything else since that would be spoiling the fun of whats head,positive
there are many involving tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam,positive
it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil and rooting for the good guys in this case jeff,positive
kurt russell is one of the few topnotch hollywood actors which doesnt overblow his acting and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses,positive
so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letterperfect,positive
suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation from a jolly man to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one,positive
not many wellpaid actors can deliver these type of performances but russell is one of them,positive
as an everyday man he pulls it off extremely convincingly what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes,positive
although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences very well done yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with,positive
faced with an enigma about his wifes whereabouts the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters including the cryptic villains who in essence make the movie what it is,positive
whats most impressive however is the feature debut by jonathan mostow,positive
mostow hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nailbiting suspense sought for in a well made affair,positive
contrary to most american thrillers he doesnt rely on visual flair but on aesthetics and substance,positive
after breakdown he should gain vast notoriety,positive
the villains in the movie arent your routine outofthisworld idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective,positive
the baddies in breakdown all well acted are normal seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder,positive
the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks and of all things in the world it is becoming rather easy to root for villains jon voight in anaconda in todays movies,positive
worth a special mentioning is j t walsh who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision as the leader of the gang he renders a deliciously wicked performance temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for,positive
alfred hitchcock used suspenseand action not only to stimulate but as a way of aiding his audiences fascination in his stories which were slowly realizing mans biggest fears,positive
breakdown yields exactly that,positive
it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man acting like an ordinary man looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero,positive
despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock i think would approve of breakdown,positive
1 33,positive
when bulworth ended i allowed myself a sigh of relief it is possible for me to enjoy political satire,positive
there have been several recent political films that didnt do a whole lot for me wag the dog for instance i found to be an intelligent but heartless film while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness,positive
bulworth is a far better film than these both in its execution and lasting impression,positive
its a tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it also has an emotional center star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character and in turn we like him and actually care about the story,positive
beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again,positive
he hasnt slept in days nor has he eaten and almost instantaneously he goes insane,positive
hes not stark raving mad not outright anyway but hes definitely bonkers,positive
its the final weekend of his campaign and his assistant murphy oliver platt has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto,positive
bulworth begins the speech but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest,positive
you mean one lady asks the democratic party doesnt care about the african american community,positive
well he shouts laughing isnt that obvious,positive
the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life he muses later that its a bad thing to make decisions when youre suicidal he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses graham beckel whom he believes to be the hitman,positive
bulworth also meets nina halle berry with whom he becomes infatuated,positive
suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworths nononsense truth in politics methods become a national sensation and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that hes appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences,positive
beattys work on both sides of the camera is excellent,positive
his script and direction are both extremely sharp as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself,positive
here is a man whos reached his limit and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure,positive
i like that the film doesnt take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich although the antirich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film,positive
some of the segments are simply hilarious such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him,positive
much of the film is completely absurd but thats the fun part about it,positive
its an angry serious film at the core but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre,positive
what adds to this feeling is beattys portrayal of bulworth this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale,positive
beatty is so much fun to watch here hes always funny but hes also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions,positive
beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcomings as a human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning,positive
the supporting cast is vast and colorful,positive
berry is luminous as always and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles,positive
don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses guntoting toddlers to do his dirty work,positive
oliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting though hes very funny to watch paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections,positive
is bulworth offensive,positive
i suppose some may see it that way,positive
i wasnt offended by the film but then again i hardly care about politics,positive
i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story,positive
the film isnt perfect of course the ending didnt quite work for me and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic,positive
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film,positive
bulworth is a smart uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface,positive
the heist of a flawless 84 carat diamond fixed bare knuckle fights irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchiess sophomore feature snatch,positive
lock stock and two smoking barrels introd ritchie with a hyperkinetic in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewers attention from beginning to end,positive
his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive,positive
with snatch the director doesnt remake his first work but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london mining a rich collection of characters in the process,positive
from the very beginning snatch tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond the desire of new york gangster avi dennis farina,positive
en route from antwerp diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers benicio del toro stops in london to make a separate deal with avis partner and cousin doug the head mike reid,positive
frankies addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris the blade rade sherbedgia a ruthless russian mobster,positive
the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents vinnie robbie gee sol lennie james and portly tyrone ade that goes miserably awry,positive
meanwhile a couple of young toughs turkish jason stratham and tommy stephen graham are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top alan ford who also owns a pig farm,positive
when their first fighter is put out of action with one punch by a wild irish gypsy named mickey oneil they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight,positive
mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommys deal,positive
brick top impressed by mickeys performance decides to gives them another chance after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse,positive
when avi doesnt get his precious rock he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend bullet tooth tony vinnie jones to find frankie and the diamond,positive
things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of doublecross and doubledeals and a dog that ate a squeaky toy,positive
guy ritchie mr madonna to some is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters mouths like machine gun fire,positive
the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time the above description by brick top being just one example,positive
the assemblage of actors and nonactors in roughandtumble settings gives snatch an earthy feel in its depiction of londons criminal underworld,positive
the cast of characters is too large to credit here but two of the performances first among equals you might say are worth noting,positive
alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless evil brick top,positive
when he refuses sugar in his tea because im sweet enough it makes you shiver even as you laugh,positive
his is one of the best gangster characters ive seen in years,positive
the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt the name actor the movies popularity may hang upon at least initially,positive
pitt as mickey oneil is hard drinking hard fighting highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers the irish travelers of europe,positive
this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth especially if it would benefit his beloved mum sorcha cusack,positive
when brick top threaten the safety of mickeys family he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped,positive
pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff too as a bareknuckle boxer,positive
the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim mauricejones and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life,positive
there is a patent feel to the look of snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels that reeks of signature for ritchie but im not sure how this will translate in his future works,positive
there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions,positive
nonetheless snatch is terrific sophomore effort a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot,positive
i give it a b,positive
with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the film noir genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control fargo millers crossing blood simple and offthewall comedies centered around an eccentric scatterbrained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy,positive
their latest offering the big lebowski falls within the latter category though there are elements of the crimegonewrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film,positive
the main difference however is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didnt quite have the brains to get it all together the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy whos wise to the world but he doesnt really want to do much of anything besides go bowling smoke pot and generally relax,positive
that main character is jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced by the films rambling narrator sam elliott as quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county,positive
the dude is unemployed needless to say and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends walter john goodman a borderlinepsychotic whos in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebodys cheating in a bowling match has the whole world gone crazy he shouts at a suspected cheater and donny steve buscemi whos always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it donny you have no frame of reference here,positive
these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro who when we first meet him is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of hotel california and if its possible seems to be even more of a head case than walter,positive
if that doesnt give you a good idea of this films absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dudes rug,positive
theyve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara,positive
the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug he doesnt have any luck but when bunny is apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the 1 million ransom,positive
unfortunately walter gets involved and fouls up the dropoff and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers the dudes car gets stolen along with the briefcase containing the money,positive
soon the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german nihilists who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn,positive
meanwhile the big lebowskis daughter maude julianne moore a feminist avantgarde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked wants to recover the money for her family,positive
the plot however is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc,positive
the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revivals run through the jungle and it fits the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully,positive
the film doesnt feature quite as many oneliners and sight gags as the coens other comedies though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor particularly in the dudes dream sequences and acid flashbacks but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact,positive
the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution,positive
theres also a noticeable but not too heavyhanded thread of social commentary in the big lebowski which incidentally takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech,positive
the coens take aim at just about every elite l a subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose,positive
shouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on,positive
by the end we really start to admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters,positive
he also turns out to have a pretty wellfunctioning brain in his head even if he doesnt like to use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when hes getting a run around and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end,positive
the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they dont just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either,positive
i think that more than anything is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy it manages to approach characters like the dude and to some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatterbrained,positive
audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the undynamic duo by the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first,positive
its good knowin hes out there the dude takin it easy posits the narrator towards the end,positive
i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken,positive
scream 2 like its predecessor is a genrecrossing film,positive
it is about 50 horror film and 50 murder mystery,positive
the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time,positive
scream was also known for its selfreferential tone,positive
many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven,positive
again scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as sequels suck and the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels,positive
scream 2s story is very similar to its predecessors,positive
sidney neve campbell having survived the killing spree in scream is now in college,positive
gale weathers courteney cox has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film called stab which for all practical purposes is the realworld movie scream,positive
at the premiere of stab two students from sidneys college are stabbed to death and a new story begins,positive
the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer,positive
they want to know all about the links between stab sidney and the recent murders,positive
the most complex selfreference i saw this should be an olympic event was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference,positive
the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers,positive
the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press,positive
the audience was watching the whole filmed scene,positive
whew,positive
the movie is packed with layers and selfreferences that make it a pleasure to watch,positive
even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 thats not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep or even a good movie,positive
the just add to the fun of watching it,positive
i recommend it for other reasons as well,positive
what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural,positive
no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible,positive
it is a person in a mask and a robe his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims,positive
no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer,positive
the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies you have less grounds to say its just a movie,positive
the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself gale weathers and deputy dewey david arquette also from the original track down a killer,positive
they are likeable but not outstanding,positive
but in combination with the horror aspect the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint,positive
it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream,positive
the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works so i wonder if ill be doing the same thing on january 1 1999,positive
if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high ill be happy to mark my calendar,positive
id rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher,positive
with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story,positive
he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation,positive
from elmer gantry on we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church,positive
well think again for the apostle which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister and by implication all the rest of organized religion,positive
instead it gives us a highly devout man who certainly has his foibles but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god,positive
and arguably just as surprising the goodspirited film is no comedy even if it does have humorous moments,positive
instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures,positive
when in the privacy of his attic robert duvall as texas preacher euliss sonny dewey argues sternly with his lord the scene shares a kinship with emily watsons character crying out for her god in breaking the wavess most powerful scene,positive
the body of the story starts with sonnys coming upon an horrific auto accident which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters,positive
with his well worn bible in hand sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accidents dying victims,positive
the scowling police officer orders him to go away and after he has tried to work his miracles sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lords work,positive
robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the films director writer executive producer and chief financier,positive
rarely has a movie been such a labor of love,positive
with a white suit peachcolored shirt and tie and dark sunglasses sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher,positive
duvall has every movement down pat,positive
even when he is walking down the street the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy,positive
he dances and claps all the way,positive
sonnys churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deepvoiced black orators but his rhetoric is always competitive,positive
i may be on the devils hitlist but im on gods mailing list he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent,positive
and they lap it up,positive
people jump up scream praise the lord,positive
and mean it,positive
the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable,positive
but sonny is no saint,positive
it turns out that he has a wandering eye which angers his wife jessie played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett,positive
jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the churchs youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonnys church leaving him unemployed,positive
sonny letting his temper get the best of him does something foolish which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever,positive
the bulk of the film occurs in a small predominately black church in louisiana which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church one way road to heaven holiness temple with an enthusiastic flock,positive
in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e f the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church,positive
he asks his members to tithe but he gives all of his money,positive
and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks,positive
a man who cant stand to be still he tells one of his friends i quit school because i didnt like recess,positive
in his new town he meets toosie miranda richardson who like him has a family that she hasnt seen in a while,positive
his romance with the separated woman like the rest of the film doesnt follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies,positive
billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker,positive
his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of shows many surprising scenes again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take,positive
although it probably couldnt have ended any other way the movie does wrap things up nicely,positive
and dont miss the sweet epilogue during the films closing credits,positive
a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film,positive
the apostle runs a little too long at 2 12,positive
it is rated pg13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up,positive
in zoolander the worlds most successful influential and intellectuallychallenged male model derek zoolander wonders is there more to life than being really really really good looking,positive
obviously the films creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a featurelength movie out of his hilarious vh1vogue fashion awards shortfilm subject can there be more to this film than being really really really silly,positive
no of course not and it never aspires to be anything more,positive
much like derek zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie,positive
its not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy and it never produces any gutbusting laughs except maybe a scene when dereks model roommates all die in a tragic gasoline fight accident a riotously funny takeoff of tommy hilfiger ads,positive
but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles wild characters and performances and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused,positive
better yet this exaggerated version of the original threeminute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag,positive
zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs,positive
fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu will ferrell drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed,positive
enter derek whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel owen wilson takes the spotlight,positive
on the trail of mugatus plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries stillers reallife wife christine taylor and shes hoping to use mugatus pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme,positive
much like the austin powers films zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today,positive
wilson is hysterical as the young vain hansel,positive
ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant freakish mugatu in the same way dr evil upstages everyone in austin powers,positive
jerry stiller bens dad whos best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld makes a priceless turn as dereks slimy agent maury ballstein,positive
even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged largeassed masseuse,positive
as for ben stiller it seems his derek has one gag hes stupid which plays out in some uproarious oneliners,positive
unfortunately taylor seems out of place and out of her league here,positive
maybe its just because i cant stop seeing her as marcia brady who she played in both brady movies making her unbelievable as a dowdy brainy plain jane who hasnt had sex in two years,positive
she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo who wouldve added real comic substance to the flimsy role,positive
while zoolander is hardly highbrow its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days,positive
zoolanders no masterpiece but a very worthy distraction,positive
richard linklaters slacker made in 1991 for a budget of only 23 000 immerses itself in the twentysomething collegetown culture of austin texas,positive
most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning,positive
their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy the pervasiveness of slave morality the subtle messages in pop culture and such,positive
ask them what theyve been doing lately and theyll more likely than not reply oh you know just hanging out,positive
linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters the camera follows one person for a few minutes then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door,positive
its certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas some of them are just plain weird and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are,positive
the opening monologue delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film,positive
other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy while groups of pseudointellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle briberybased morality in scoobydoo,positive
for the most part however the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types,positive
near the beginning a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars,positive
another man seems to be collecting televisions keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera,positive
and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below,positive
the only problem with slacker is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end,positive
since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while,positive
there are only so many times you can hear hey whats going on,positive
not much what are you up to,positive
nothing really just hanging around before it gets on your nerves the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization,positive
and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half a jfk buff for example seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist and many of the characters just generally arent as weird or unique,positive
instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first linklater shows us the oddballs first then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too,positive
slacker is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy whatever its flaws and its status as a cult classic is welldeserved,positive
i just cant help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order,positive
written by john grisham and robert altman as al hayes,positive
directed by robert altman,positive
some time ago a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel,positive
the novel was a summer smash topping bestseller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads,positive
the only problem the novel wasnt very good,positive
it was far more pulp than pulitzer,positive
but the director realized that no matter how pedestrian the prose this book really grabbed people that the author while not a great writer was a fantastic storyteller,positive
so he took on the project convinced he could make something happen on screen,positive
the director,positive
francis ford coppola,positive
the book of course was mario puzos the godfather,positive
the rest as they say in showbiz was history,positive
by bringing up the godfather i dont mean to suggest that robert altmans the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness,positive
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material,positive
can you get any more questionable than john grisham,positive
depends on whom you ask,positive
but theres no question that grishams work grabs people,positive
like puzo grisham is a better storyteller than a writer unlike fellow hack michael crichton who is a good idea man but who cant tell a wellconstructed story from a can of spam,positive
so something in grishams unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman who at 73 years old remains one of americas greatest living filmmakers,positive
the result is a gripping thriller that while falling short of classic cinema deserves its place in the altman canon,positive
from its opening shot to the closing credits the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe,positive
this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch,positive
witness said opening shot we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear,positive
we roll over the hills into the town of savannah then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone,positive
right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises,positive
pay attention boys and girls this shot was not conceived by john grisham but by altman,positive
this is what a great director can do for questionable source material,positive
the sports car belongs to rick magruder kenneth branagh the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases,positive
magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office,positive
outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses mallory doss embeth davidzt just as she realizes her car has been stolen,positive
driven by southern chivalry a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress magruder offers her a ride home,positive
there he learns more about mallorys life than he bargained for,positive
her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon robert duvall a ted kyzynskistyle whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter,positive
magruder perhaps influenced by mallorys decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him is sympathetic to her plight and offers to help her get her father committed right after he sleeps with her of course,positive
this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end,positive
he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital and for a moment all appears well,positive
but then dixons crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup and suddenly magruder finds himself mallory and his own children in danger,positive
the cops wont lift a finger to help a liberal attorney,positive
his only allies are his faithful assistant lois daryl hannah and his bumbling privateeye sidekick clyde robert downey jr,positive
if this predicament wasnt bad enough hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos,positive
altman may provide the atmosphere but branaghs performance holds the gingerbread man together,positive
an accomplished actor when he isnt directing himself in vanity productions branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives,positive
is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness or of egotism,positive
magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it and by then its too late,positive
as the plot unfolds magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are,positive
and life is never so bad that it cant get worse,positive
if youre familiar with altmans work youll recognize several of his signature techniques,positive
characters are not introduced in establishing shots but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent,positive
crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action,positive
dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style,positive
and of course theres my favorite altman technique the obligatory nude actress shot,positive
thanks to altman here are some of the actresses ive had the pleasure of seeing naked sally kellerman julianne moore madeline stowe even frances mcdormand,positive
and now i can add embeth davidtz who looks quite healthy in the altogether,positive
the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film,positive
is it oldschool sexism or a clever injoke,positive
you be the judge,positive
but back to the picture at hand,positive
in the hands of a mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller no better or worse than the countless others weve all endured,positive
in the hands of a master like altman it becomes an exercise in existential doom in its own way far more successful than scorseses cape fear remake which tried for the same result,positive
what may prevent it from enduring with altmans greatest work is a weak third act in fact there really is no third act in grishams story so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up,positive
but there are true moments of riveting suspense and great performances by branagh davidzt and downey jr more than enough to see you through,positive
that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are,positive
they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill,positive
and that my friends should make you very afraid,positive
john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles,positive
so effortlessly that people tend to forget hes there much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actors face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors,positive
example the other day my mother asked me the expert of course if there were any movies out worth seeing never mind that our tastes couldnt be more divergent ill never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go,positive
was a lot of fun which it is so i didnt see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation,positive
i muttered with a little trepidation that she might enjoy high fidelity,positive
she responded with her usual query whose in that one,positive
this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see,positive
if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people usually of the jewish faith fretting about in some upper east side palace,positive
anyway when i answered john cusack she replied with a rather stunned who as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to,positive
now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin but i suppose its understandable that she would not recognize the name after all for most names are tougher than faces,positive
i showed her a picture of cusacks mug in the paper hoping for an oh him yes hes quite good instead i got a no i dont know him,positive
at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger yes filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone till i realized something i doubt that much of america would recognize cusacks relatively bland visage or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise onesyllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car,positive
cusack cusack no not quite as cool,positive
im sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as the guy from add in the cusack film of your choice,positive
hes not a brand name and his movies usually arent big moneymakers but in his own unassuming way hes kind of a genius,positive
with his pleasant common man looks and charming semiarticulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90s,positive
from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon,positive
despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it the schlumpy every man hes a constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brooks or woody allen,positive
and he knows how to chose scripts while the stephan baldwins and val kilmers seem to put them selves in everything the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent cusack generally picks rewarding projects save for the unwatchable hot pursuit a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller,positive
high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears the grifters the hilo country and its a hit,positive
it was also cowritten by cusack and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy grosse point blank,positive
its not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film but as it progresses in its meandering fashion the movie cast something of a spell over me,positive
high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the noncommittal rob a vinyl record store owner who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his top 5 break ups list,positive
this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris buellers day off,positive
at first the talkingdirectlyintothecameraschtick had me vaguely annoyed mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusacks witty delivery,positive
hes the kind of guy we dont mind talking directly to us,positive
gradually the film settles into a shampoolike tragicomic character study of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is yes its all very existential,positive
though that plotline is mostly enjoyable the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters all of whom now this is really something are terrific enough to warrant their own films,positive
the best of which is jack black of the very funny show tenacious d a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis hair unfortunately that annoying smirk remains an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy,positive
hes the kind of guy im sure weve all met before a blowhard who thinks hes always right and will do anything in his power be it yell argue insult to hoist his opinion onto others,positive
but i like this guy because of how black plays him,positive
the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak which might be a bit of a redundant description seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic,positive
hes the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films,positive
look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister,positive
but fears and black never let that happen,positive
the character for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality,positive
hes over the top but in a way we can all probably relate to,positive
catherine zetajones in her brief role gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own charm,positive
tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new agetype a character played entirely for cartoon yuks but still manages to work its desired comic effect,positive
the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle mifune who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent replacing it with a stilted american phonation,positive
i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role but instead of being likeable she comes across as rather robotic and as such its hard to see why cusacks character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful intelligent writer natasha gregson wagner potentially waiting in the wings,positive
this reminded me of say anything where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood whose unbelievably more wooden then father clint for those special people whose wheels turn a little slower,positive
in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his though id bet that if laura and natasha switched roles the result would be more effective,positive
high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances,positive
fears direction is somewhat stilted and the script is sometimes a little too and this is a word im beginning to hate to use but alas i must quirky for its own good i think ill blame that on scott rosenberg who judging from what he did with beautiful girls con air and things to do in denver while your dead has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie,positive
but cusack really does deserve an award for being so damn cusackian,positive
im afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent,positive
his character rob whose sort of like an older more bitter lloyd from say anything is funny and tragic without being pathetic and that cusack can do all this and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences is something of an achievement,positive
tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever,positive
not surprising considering its tiny us100 000 budget to date it has earned in excess of us130 million,positive
thats a shocking 100 times profit,positive
rumours have it that a smart internet marketing ploy was so successful in gaining cultlike fanatics by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews the film just exploded in the boxoffice raking in millions on its opening weekend,positive
shot in 16mm and video i suspect the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch,positive
audiences are put in the firstperson perspective in the entire misadventure often wobbly and blurry at times it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning,positive
this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences,positive
tbwp is simply smart,positive
filmed to look as if it was really a stockshoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project one may suspect like yours truly that its simply a lazy but smart approach to filmmaking,positive
simply amazing in that respect i must say,positive
talk about impact oh yes tbwp does have quite a bit in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing,positive
i did especially the last bit but im not revealing more,positive
you have to see it for yourself,positive
i cant help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become,positive
could it be that finally an indiefilm has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal,positive
or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning,positive
well i guess the fact stays tbwp is highly original clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film,positive
no gore no special effects i just cant get over how terribly smart this film is,positive

a strange mixture of shine basquiat angel heart and grant morrison dave mckeans graphic novel arkham asylum the cavemans valentine is a feverish tale of a homeless madmancumdetective who on the morning of february 14th discovers a valentine just outside his new york cave one of ella fitzgeralds strange fruit stuck in the crotch of a treea young male model murdered and frozen to a branch,positive

his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation romulus was a brilliant julliardtrained pianist prior to his psychosis romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his policewoman daughter aunjanue ellis that even though hes a nut that doesnt mean that he cant solve a highprofile society murder,positive
every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas and every character the same the cavemans valentine is a concept so high concept that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment with romuluss caveman a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlanes urban noir hero spawn,positive
with a longvanished wife tamara tunie acting as a spiritual guide the occasional social caste commentary the secret base in a cave a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters and a wickedly colourful archenemy the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars werent inscribed with gotham pd,positive
that being said the cavemans valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart,positive
the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when in fact the cavemans valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless again like mcfarlanes spawn while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts,positive
it is no small detail that our hero romulus is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life in legend without knowledge of his royal birth but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park in the romulus mythology signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures while in the film the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds but of the carrion itself,positive
whether or not romulus of the cavemans valentine will found a nation or in the case of novelist george dawes green upon whose novel his own screenplay is based a franchise the fact remains that the cavemans valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far,positive
it along with m night shyamalans unbreakable is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has since millers seminal the dark knight returns redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics,positive
readers of sam keiths brilliant the maxx comic series or of mtvs shortlived animated adaptation of the same are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne,positive
the failure of both the maxx tv show and of the cavemans valentine not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable suggests that the public may not be ready for americas surprising contributions to dark fantasy,positive
luxuriantly lit brashly saturated and comicpanel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent death in venice ca while inhabiting robin standefers practical magic mesmerizing sets the cavemans valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film,positive
kasi lemmons following up her brilliant 1997 debut eves bayou which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys artists and suffering,positive
the cavemans valentine is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape,positive
clearly not for every taste when approached with the correct paradigm it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year a redefinition of the hero archetype for a postmodern audience with urinestained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes,positive
the cavemans valentine is a fine and a courageous film crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliots rats alley wasteland,positive
bruce lee was a biggerthanlife martial artist and actor,positive
bruces unique character i e selfproduced sound effects etc and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor james lee,positive
the story is told from his wife lindas point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lees life,positive
however you cant help but like whenever the fight scenes are on what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character,positive
i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lees life before he became famous scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english,positive
it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else,positive
scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the allwhite students cheerleaders and athletes,positive
it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes,positive
in conclusion the movie was well made it produced a realization of who bruce lee was and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor,positive
and the fighting scenes were all excellent,positive
so go see it and enjoy the movie,positive
p s if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven,positive
before even seeing a single frame of the film it would be easy to snicker at deep impact in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet,positive
it is the latest entry in this decades dubious revival of the 70s disaster film and the first of two the sky is falling flicks to hit screens this year the other being this coming julys armageddon in which a meteor is the threat,positive
its tagline oceans rise,positive
cities fall,positive
hope survives is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight they came in alone the only way out,positive
is together but its every bit as treacly,positive
the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at,positive
the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions such as the usual opening roll call in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced,positive
the most prominent of the personal stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner tea leoni who is distraught that her father maximilian schell left her mother vanessa redgrave for a younger woman rya kihlstedt,positive
what is just as snickerworthy is how this coventure between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another highprofile corporate collaboration microsoft and nbcs cable news network msnbc which employs jenny who is the films ostensible main character,positive
in the vision of america presented here msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country,positive
the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dantes peak but theres one thing about deep impact i underestimated the skills of director mimi leder,positive
she won an emmy for her helming work on nbcs smash er which is essentially a weekly disaster movie each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises,positive
the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold 1 to make the audience care for these guest characters regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are and 2 powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavyhanded or overly melodramatic,positive
having passed the er challenge in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubins rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen,positive
as the countdown to impact progresses the ominous feeling of doom is palpable leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension,positive
theres nothing here that will profoundly move anyone but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects,positive
situations that initially feel contrived such as jennys familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner leelee sobieski and comet discoverer leo biederman elijah wood achieve some poignance and even the more vaguely drawn characters including u s president tom beck morgan freeman astronaut spurgeon fish tanner robert duvall and his rather faceless crew ron eldard jon favreau mary mccormack blair underwood and alexander baluyev aboard the cometbombing spacecraft messiah have their share of touching moments,positive
the latter fact owes a debt to the actors who all do a solid job and are wellcast with the possible exception of leoni she delivers a decent performance but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster,positive
although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister it is the first of the 90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring truea film that makes a genuine impact even if it isnt as deep as hoped,positive
the long and illustrious career of robin williams which has included both forgettable turns like mrs,positive
doubtfire and flubber was punctuated with the actors first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting,positive
it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989s dead poets society and critical remarks were unanimously positive,positive
his next role that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come was unfortunately lackluster,positive
and so after a sixyear stint as a comedic actor the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams,positive
williams is the title character hunter patch adams sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the cleanshavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting,positive
were introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies,positive
its at the institution however that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people,positive
he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginias medical college where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating impersonal trade,positive
his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion and the movie climaxes with patchs appearance before the state medical board,positive
the characters are welldefined in an oscarworthy sense,positive
although the script does not perform well as a narrative theres little story to be told outside of patchs skitlength experiences the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters,positive
at medical school patch meets up with truman schiff daniel london an outsider like himself who relishes patchs zest for humanity,positive
the two instantly become the best of friends and its easy to see why,positive
monica potter plays patchs love interest a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school,positive
for some reason hes attracted to her and although it never gets said the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view,positive
the script based on hunter adams own story works well this way,positive
the rest of the cast bob gunton as the villain professor in particular is solid,positive
director tom shadyac liar liar leads us in and out of patchs life in a sound intentional manner combined with williams presence on screen the movie rarely becomes boring,positive
patch adams lack of purpose is its major shortcoming and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours theres little feeling of continuity or the passage of time,positive
nevertheless its an emotionally moving picture and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season,positive
it succeeds at everything it tries and only fails at the stuff it doesnt try in the first place,positive
by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams but more importantly its entertainment for the entire family,positive
now that boogie nights has made disco respectable again well fashionable at least we shouldnt be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era,positive
the latest art house interpretation is whit stillmans the last days of disco,positive
stillman who made metropolitan and barcelona using some of the same actors uses discos final hours to highlight what is another conversationheavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director,positive
the young upwardlymobile professional dont call them yuppies,positive
men and women of the last days of disco frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the basspounding rhythms of earth wind and fire amy grant and andrea true connection,positive
here they talk and talk and talk intellectualizing about such things as dating success and being liked accepted and admired,positive
if talk is cheap the last days of disco must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot,positive
what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie harvardeducated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit perception and style including at one point a riotously inventive deconstruction of the lady and the tramp,positive
na ve alice chlo sevigny and sophisticated charlotte kate beckinsale are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house,positive
charlotte is confident and outspokenperhaps a little too outspoken alice is shy and introverted like a kindergarten teacher,positive
the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot looking good and looking for excitement and that ms beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor,positive
here they meet or remeet a variety of eligible men many of whom they knew in college,positive
des played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman is one of the clubs managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back,positive
des has reached a crisis point in his life he just found outlast wednesday in factthat hes gay,positive
whether its true or not it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend jennifer beals in a small but soulbaring turn,positive
charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth,positive
jimmy mackenzie astin is the advertising exec who by the end of the picture winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain visions of barcelona,positive
josh matt keeslar is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say just once book this clown,positive
and robert sean leonard plays another one of alices revolving suitors the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity,positive
any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book,positive
in fact the entire ensemble is appealing in that wellspoken stillman way,positive
while the eschewing of ferocious pairing is a favored topic of conversation in the film the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love lust and trouble with each other in an emotional merrygoround that cleverly develops its characters through the preferred dynamics of social group interaction,positive
more mature than stillmans previous two films the last days of disco is as consistently droll as it is stimulating,positive
its a movie you should definitely get on down to,positive
did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet,positive
or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extraterrestrial,positive
i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher ms carey,positive
but after seeing this movie they may have confirmed my suspicions,positive
as the story goes at any time there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth,positive
the men in black mib are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens guardians of our beloved planet from nastytempered aliens and secret service to the stars,positive
based in new york city where weird is the norm the mib organization gives human form to our spacefaring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed,positive
but to enforce the laws of earth the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast,positive
they carry otherworldly technology to erase peoples shortterm memory when common folk see the mib in action,positive
and their best leads on cosmic thingsgoneawry are the supermarket tabloids,positive
little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v evil going on in the depths of space,positive
one of the aliensashuman on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious,positive
it holds the key literally to universal peace,positive
a giant cockroachlike alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this key,positive
in the wrong alien hands flippers,positive
mandibles,positive
tentacles it can be used as a weapon,positive
therefore it must be recovered and returned to its rightful owners,positive
otherwise to ensure universal safety earth will be destroyed along with the key,positive
now its the mib who must prevent this catastrophe,positive
the mib agents on the case are k played by tommy lee jones,positive
he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore,positive
the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes,positive
he is accompanied by a flippant rookie j played by will smith,positive
but despite this shootemup protectearthfromdestruction premise this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie,positive
and this isnt an independence day knockoff,positive
rather this is a stylishly offbeat scifi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies that there are real aliens that live here and that the government does its darndest to cover them up,positive
but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe there must be some kind of earthhangsinthebalance scenario,positive
yet this movie is very appealing,positive
the abundance of wierdness talking aliens peewee atomizers a mortician who lives for her work and lots of yucky bugs and slimesplattering galore is played straight like as if this were normal of course we are in nyc,positive
it gives it a deadpan feel which makes it all the more funnier and odder,positive
jones plays the venerable seenitall agent with seriousness and maturity,positive
smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones straight man routine,positive
they click like dorothys ruby red shoes,positive
the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld the addams family,positive
this guy has a knack for gothic comedy and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen,positive
and an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors,positive
the story moves well and before you know it the end credits are already rolling,positive
the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs aaaahhhs and wows,positive
let the men in black protect and color your world,positive
after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again,positive
there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles as a master would teach an eager apprentice,positive
you caress the noodles with the chopsticks he says then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying see you soon,positive
of course its meant to be a parody but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety,positive
you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat not something you like not something you enjoy but rather something you experience,positive
experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts,positive
trust me you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point,positive
juzo itamis tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western set in modern day japan,positive
a stranger goro tsutomu yamazaki comes into town and finds tampopo nobuko miyamoto the proprietor of a small holeinthewall noodle shop trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman pisken rikiya yasuoka,positive
goro to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen emerging bloodied but victorious,positive
goro finds that tampopos ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away just to eat a bowl of her ramen,positive
the problem is her fare is something less than popular and less than appetizing,positive
however goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert enlist the aid of a wealthy patron and make friends with the former enemy,positive
this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems,positive
take for example when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner,positive
the price is too high but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum,positive
tampopo meets him at his store late at night and he leads her to a back room,positive
she protests thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives but he insists,positive
just when she is about to bolt for the exit he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door,positive
she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience,positive
this scene while comical is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation then of relief and discovery,positive
theres also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who despite their economic trappings are all gourmets and master sommeliers,positive
we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet,positive
the scene is meant to bring a laugh but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor food is something which everyone has in common and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all,positive
there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in peoples lives,positive
a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor,positive
surrounded by her children she is obviously in her last hours of life,positive
her husband comes home and seeing her worsened condition demands that she get up and make dinner,positive
the viewer knows the husbands intention is not to be mean he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this,positive
in a near miracle the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal then brings it to her awaiting family,positive
as the family eats she looks on them and smiles,positive
preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her and for a brief moment she too enjoys the normalcy,positive
then she falls over dead,positive
for a moment the family is stunned but then the father yells at the children keep eating,positive
this is the last meal your mother ever made,positive
crying as they do so the family finishes the meal,positive
the scene is comical awkward moving and beautiful,positive
by including the vignettes itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film but surprisingly they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline,positive
instead they even help contribute to the idea that tampopos goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble,positive
because the film parodies a western the construction of the plot is fairly predictable but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the good guys come together for the final showdown,positive
in this case the showdown is against the ramen,positive
if they eat tampopos ramen soup and all tampopo knows she has succeeded,positive
its pretty obvious what the outcome will be but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life you can afford to cut it a little slack,positive
with the release of gattaca i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens or aliens in general,positive
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films but what was usually lacking was a good story,positive
and good characters,positive
and good acting etc contact being the exception,positive
and for some reason hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth,positive
the closest that i have seen anyway was 2001 a space odyssey which made mankind an alien race themselves being dwarfed by the technology which they created,positive
now comes gattaca another film about technology reigning supreme except here on our planet,positive
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple gattaca is more frightening,positive
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering,positive
using this premise andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills,positive
unfortunately due to a lack of advertising i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office,positive
since seeing the film i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca,positive
lately however i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca,positive
most people dont even realize that it is a film,positive
despite this fact i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it,positive
niccols film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter better produced and more realistic,positive
gattaca begins in the 21st century,positive
procreating is now done in a petri dish and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it,positive
natural child birth is considered oldfashioned,positive
we are introduced to jerome morrow ethan hawke an employee of the gattaca space program,positive
one of the directors of the program has been murdered and the main suspect is one vincent freeman,positive
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman,positive
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love,positive
however after his birth and through several genetic tests doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99 chance of a weak heart as well as poor eye sight and a short life span,positive
as a result both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics,positive
anton loren dean is produced without flaws and the competition between brothers spawns,positive
vincent has a dream to fly a soloflight around the titan the 14th moon of saturn but because of his condition gattaca and society in general forces him to do menial labor around the company,positive
labeled an invalid vincents dream seems impossible until he meets a blackmarket dna specialist german tony shalhoub,positive
german introduces him to a valid who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident,positive
jerome morrow jude law agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools urine blood skin and hair samples etc that he will need to get past gattacas tight security,positive
in exchange vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship,positive
after the murder however his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincents eyelashes left at the scene of the crime,positive
irene cassini uma thurman is a genetically flawed valid working for gattaca and she begins to fall in love with,positive
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time,positive
only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years contact and the arrival and gattaca will rank among them,positive
unfortunately whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effectsladen films it normally gets buried,positive
the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs,positive
the orange glow of gattacas scenes are impressive but the sets deserve most of the credit,positive
the sets are very well done creating a futuristic sense but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers,positive
as we look at the designs we realize that these buildings arent too far into the future,positive
this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day,positive
the best thing however is the plot,positive
the story is more than your average sci,positive
at its heart it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present,positive
perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring,positive
would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies,positive
maybe human nature is a result of mankinds flaws,positive
if we get rid of flaws do we get rid of dreams as well,positive
niccols intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story or vice versa,positive
the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters,positive
while flat may sound like a poor job on niccols part it actually enhances the meaning behind the story,positive
ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor giving his best performance of his lifetime so far,positive
his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and valid peers,positive
uma thurman is well uma thurman,positive
her character is slightly underdeveloped but the story isnt about her,positive
however thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character,positive
jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character,positive
he provides several nice touches and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one,positive
loren dean gives a nice performance in his welldeveloped character,positive
dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie,positive
alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank,positive
still he does a good job,positive
gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film,positive
gattaca is rated pg13 for brief violent images language some sexuality and nudity,positive
despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film i wasnt exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty,positive
it turned me off slightly but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have,positive
if this had been a typical hollywood film it would have ended much differently,positive
however with all the mindless science fiction films out there it is nice to have a film which doesnt talk down to its audience i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding g t c and a,positive
instead it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want a science fiction film with morals behind it,positive
whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining,positive
hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca,positive
and hopefully audiences will too,positive
p s personal note to p j gladnick how dare you call this film the worst film of the year,positive
i cant even begin to image what film you do like,positive
that frightens me beyond anything,positive
roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton,positive
this italian film star best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust,positive
but benignis life is beautiful la vita e bella is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love devotion and sacrifice,positive
the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benignis guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore,positive
like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him most notably the almostforgotten harry langdon benignis guido has a childlike innocence,positive
he ignores the growing antisemitism of the fascist government,positive
instead guido ardently falls in love and persues dora a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official,positive
in benignis tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate yet slapstick encounter,positive
guido wins dora,positive
they marry,positive
fast forward about five years,positive
guido dora and their 5yearold son giosue giorgio cantarini are a happy family,positive
guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore,positive
but racial and antisemitic tensions are on the rise in italy and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities,positive
the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp,positive
here guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son but to keep him from being exterminated,positive
it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched,positive
for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror the pain the unimaginable suffering of a schindlers list,positive
true many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over and most were not sent to the death camps but to work camps where they were used as slave labor,positive
unlike steven spielberg benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust,positive
his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child,positive
for guido to save his son transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game,positive
giosue must follow the rules without question to amass 1 000 points,positive
the winner takes home a tank,positive
therefore guido tells him he must remain hidden in the barracks,positive
he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him,positive
guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates,positive
guido lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive,positive
throughout their imprisonment guidos quick thinking continually keeps his son from harms way,positive
ultimately the allies rescue the camp,positive
in a poignant scene giosue comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound,positive
the boy goes wideeyed with wonderment and delight thinking he has won the game,positive
the price for his victory is most high,positive
benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness,positive
life is beautiful is a fantasy a fable,positive
it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust,positive
those who object to it are missing its point,positive
and that is simply where there is hope where there is life and where there is love the spark of humanity will never be extinguished,positive
committed to lifelong learning through effective communication,positive
for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and high art the sons room is an inventive subtle alternative,positive
written by directed and starring nanni moretti it takes us through the slow complicated path of bereavement,positive
slow is the best description for the film at first,positive
it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal happy family,positive
father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities,positive
they laugh spend free time together and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder,positive
you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome,positive
but suddenly the son is found to be dead after a diving accident,positive
the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it but can also be trying on the attention span,positive
though the film drags and even repeats itself this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving,positive
though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production it doesnt come across as a vanity piece,positive
one might wish he hadnt picked the profession of analyst for the father giovanni which he stars as if only because this makes his characters reactions so predictable,positive
what saves it is a well written script with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction,positive
the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative or that remind a depressed person of loss,positive
you start to take notice of the cracked dishes ignored when familial bliss was in full swing,positive
you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block and not necessarily huge events like graduation,positive
even better are the role reversals that take place within the household,positive
while giovanni and paola laura morante do check up on their daughter irene jasmine trinca there is a sense of being on autopilot,positive
not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more shell make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them,positive
these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic unexpected change,positive
respectfully gender issues never enter the picture,positive
selfpropelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family,positive
though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives,positive
most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama speeches and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing,positive
in contrast the sons room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning denial depression anger bargaining acceptance through each of its main characters,positive
its not the most engaging 100 minutes but it is certainly easy to relate to,positive
produced by robert lantos stephen j roth,positive
directed by douglas williams,positive
mpaa not rated though from language violence medicalgrossouts and sexual content id put it at pg,positive
though made in canada overdrawn at the memory bank traces its roots to the bbc school of film production,positive
using for the most part cheap computer and video special effects chyron text wildlife documentary footage and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time youre twenty minutes into it you should be hooked,positive
raul julia plays aram fingal a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority,positive
caught watching casablanca on his desk monitor fingal is sentenced to doppling rehabilitationhe is to spend fortyeight hours in the body of a baboon,positive
how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybodys guess,positive
as it happens thanks to a visiting schoolboys prank his body is temporarily misplaced and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it,positive
as time ticks away before his memory cube selfdestructs the frantic search for his body is on while,positive
fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world then finds theres no better way to hack the system than from the inside,positive
during the chaos computer technician apollonia james linda griffiths maintains contact with fingal through a datalink manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings,positive
over the course of their interactions interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance,positive
given that casablanca is fingals favorite film and the basis for his fantasy world a great deal of the movie is homage to casablanca,positive
in fact the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances played by julia in a dual role and louis negin respectively in a bar called the place,positive
julias portrayal of bogart is passable and avoids becoming the schweethaat spouting parody seen in cartoons,positive
negins peter lorre is quite credible and easily the best peter lorre ive ever seen who wasnt the real thing,positive
the two of them as characters created by fingals imagination serve as aspects of his personality driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system,positive
those arent the only casablanca characters to put in appearances,positive
the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around as the fat man the alternate aspect of the films main villain the novicorp chairman donald c moore,positive
while fingals body is lost the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system with,positive
less than salutory results,positive
its interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film in the best goldenage science fiction tradition,positive
words like dopple psychist computech cinema and reconst are apparently in common use,positive
and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years pasts idea of futuristic data processing clerks some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of virtual reality today,positive
as cyberpunk films go this may not be a staple of the genre but its definitely recommended viewing,positive
the special effects are very primitive placing this production in the realm of lowtomediumbudget television,positive
the music is completely electronicsynthesized which fits the low budget but isnt really out of keeping with the genre,positive
however the writing quite makes up for it,positive
there are some very funny moments and quite a few little injokes that one needs to have seen casablanca to appreciate properly,positive
all in all i give overdrawn at the memory bank a,positive
its wednesday march 27 and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte south carolina,positive
the crime a young prostitute elizabeth renee zellweger has been brutally slain,positive
one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station,positive
the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority miles away,positive
the police duo of braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are strapped for leads,positive
at the moment they have only one possible suspect wayland tim roth a wealthy unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act,positive
thats the premise for deceiver a new thriller from the pate brothers jonas and josh who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave,positive
deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not sobright cops captions early in the proceedings let us know that waylands iq is 151 by contrast kennesaws is 122 and braxtons is 102,positive
the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered,positive
over three days as wayland returns to answer more questions the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until inevitably it boils over,positive
other plot elements are thrown in for good measure,positive
wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can in stressful situations render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent,positive
braxton a compulsive gambler is deep in debt to a local syndicate,positive
and kennesaw is haunted by a dark abusive side that delights in terrorizing women especially his wife rosanna arquette whom he suspects of being unfaithful,positive
the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeths death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand the suspect or his questioners,positive
deceiver which mostly transpires in a dimlylit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue has the feel of a david mamet play edgy claustrophobic and tense,positive
the atmosphere is explosive and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting,positive
deceiver has the power to grab an audience,positive
unfortunately in the end it succumbs to the need to throw in one last unexpected twist and this is its undoing,positive
for while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers it also stretches our credulity too much and raises more questions than it answers,positive
its only an effective wrapup if you dont think too carefully about its full implications,positive
of course the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic,positive
police procedure is totally ignored and its almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner,positive
but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction not plot details,positive
deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute,positive
the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeths final days and hours,positive
the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voiceover by visually showing what really happened,positive
moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks,positive
the movie obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir drips atmosphere,positive
there are some fascinating stylistic touches for example although the setting is contemporary all of the telephones are oldfashioned rotary models,positive
cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceivers look,positive
some of the things he tries mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow work exceptionally well while others like any of several lazy susan shots seem more like unnecessary visual tricks,positive
as wayland tim roth gives the films top performance despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting,positive
roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as hes supposed to be,positive
the other two leads chris penn and michael rooker arent as effective,positive
both play their characters like familiar types,positive
penns performance is uninspired rookers lacks subtlety,positive
some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors,positive
renee zellweger in a role thats miles away from her starmaking turn in jerry maguire brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature,positive
rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaws wife and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist whos entrusted with evaluating waylands condition,positive
one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience,positive
plot points arent hammered home and although the ending has its weaknesses everything isnt spelled out in bold letters,positive
the pates give audience members credit for having brains which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers,positive
occasionally gripping and never uninteresting deceiver is a fine noir effort,positive
kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue,positive
all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow and you instantly know what hes thinking,positive
detective story features one of kirk douglass finest performances,positive
he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night,positive
the film is based on a play and this is quite evident as most of the movie takes place in the oneroom flat that the detectives work in,positive
the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife but through a series of events he never quite makes it there,positive
the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate,positive
however this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglass wife a connection douglas himself is not aware of,positive
many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film,positive
secrets i would not dream of giving away,positive
with a name like detective story one would assume the film would resemble an episode of nypd blue but it doesnt quite work out that way,positive
however we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time,positive
lee grant virtually unrecognizable plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting,positive
her scenes with bendix another detective provide the movie with a few laughs,positive
the performances all around are fantastic,positive
douglas may be the leader of this ensemble but hes not the center of attention all the time,positive
we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases,positive
which brings me back to douglas,positive
he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him,positive
we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime but has finally realized that what hes really done is gotten back at his criminal father,positive
how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing,positive
kirk douglas is the kind of actor we dont seem to see to much of these days hes a tough guy but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior,positive
when i was growing up in 1970s boys in my school used to divide into two groups based on their action movies preferences,positive
the first one myself included liked movies that featured spectacular car chases lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions,positive
the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks probably because they could or to be more precise thought they could imitate its stunts in the real life,positive
decades later while refining my own cinematic taste i began to appreciate and actually like those movies probably because of overexposure to shootemup idiocy of 1980s ramboids,positive
yes most of the kung fu and other martial arts flicks were cheap they had predictable and formulaic plot and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills,positive
but in the same time those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation,positive
the best of those movies one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon,positive
made in 1973 in a joint hong kong hollywood venture it was intended to bring bruce lees skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience,positive
it succeeded but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor,positive
lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert,positive
he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join triannual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island owned and controlled by han renegade shaolin monk,positive
interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics gunrunning and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene,positive
lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons oharra hans brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lees sister years ago,positive
the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us williams played by jim kelly is black activist running from the racist police and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts,positive
the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later,positive
the main hero was faced against a powerhungry megalomaniac on a remote island alone against whole army of bad guys,positive
on the other hand lee was more believable hero than bond deprived of guns and supertech gadgets he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive,positive
in the same time the plot although extremely thin allowed him even some internal battles between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own antiviolent philosophy,positive
the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lees acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence,positive
although two other main actors john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy were intended to share top spot with lee they served as nothing more than a comic relief,positive
it is a real shame to see kelly definitely the worse actor than saxon to steal the scenes from him only because his lines being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches sound so damn over the top,positive
other actors not including shih kien who turns han into typical although not very convincing bondian villain are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee among them is young jackie chan,positive
fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre,positive
in many way they are also more realistic they were personally staged by lee himself demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent,positive
im not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply cant avoid to appreciate the difference from todays movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end,positive
so despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who dont like that particular genre,positive
with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresofts square pictures final fantasy inspired by the topselling game franchise is visually aweinspiring and groundbreaking,positive
no doubt you have never seen anything like this film and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved,positive
but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting,positive
obviously the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi,positive
everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail individual threads in the fabric individual strands of hair swaying wrinkles and pimples on skin incredible water effects,positive
overall the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue and the times when they dont sync perfectly really stand out since the animation is usually so dazzling,positive
but you wont spend much time dwelling on those gaffes as soon as you catch one the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering wow,positive
like the series of games final fantasys plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind hironobu sakaguchi,positive
its the year 2065 and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien phantoms,positive
whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors the ofteninvisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul for some unexplainable reason,positive
while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein james woods to blast the aliens with a zeus cannon dr aki ross mingna and dr sid donald sutherland plan to build a wave using eight collected spirits to counteract the phantoms and kill them off,positive
while the images serve the scifi aspect of the film well the storytelling doesnt,positive
its unfortunate because the plot seems so intricately thought out,positive
perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script,positive
some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english except two americans wrote the screenplay,positive
nevertheless the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes,positive
why do these aliens feed on souls,positive
if they can pass through bodies and ships how can humans hurt them with guns,positive
what is so special about the spirits that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens,positive
worse yet the dialogue is scripted to be either like a scienceheavy star trek episode an installment of die hard or a sappy love story depending on whos doing the talking,positive
for the most part its bearable considering the genre but tedious speeches and cheesy lines dont do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes,positive
the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming who always has great cracks during tense moments,positive
but when the lights come up and the credits roll youre more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked,positive
theres no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film,positive
youd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more,positive
i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night,positive
i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success personal growth and insightful humor about life,positive
i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard getting some of the latter and not much of the former,positive
the basic plot revolves around billy crystal who plays mitch robbins turning forty,positive
hes now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original,positive
hes given a job at the radio station to his best friend played by daniel stern out of sympathy while sterns character works through his divorce,positive
his loser younger brother john lovitz comes to mitchs house to bum a money and place to live all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday,positive
during the celebration mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curlys the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance old hat,positive
after a business trip to las vegas crystal stern and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure,positive
on the way they run into curlys twin brother duke played by you know who jack palance,positive
first of all the cinematography was beautifully done especially the outdoor scenes in the desert,positive
the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself,positive
there is some character development during the film,positive
the actors remain true to their characters and play them well without overplaying the jokes,positive
the movie is a good basic adventure with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict,positive
the movie is paced well but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end,positive
humorwise the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film,positive
there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel surprise surprise for a sequel right,positive
however the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the films manipulation of the audience,positive
the film tries to pull your heartstrings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friends butt,positive
this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original,positive
there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didnt worry more about water while tromping around the desert,positive
some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here,positive
since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey,positive
overall id say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some storyline deficiencies making it less worthy than the original,positive
it may be worth the full price of admission but a matinee would be a better bargain,positive
on the basis of this film alone i never would have predicted that in two years quentin tarantino would become the countrys biggest hotshot director,positive
reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction but is a much less substantive more conventional crime story than the big pf,positive
heres what the two movies do have in common,positive
scenes of intelligent amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical chronological sequence graphic yet necessary violence an engaging crime story dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and slurs three of the same actors harvey keitel tim roth and steve buscemi a mexican standoff ending although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf,positive
reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because its only got one story to tell rather than three,positive
crime lord joe cabot veteran actor lawrence tierney has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist,positive
the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated,positive
instead they are all given code names off the color chart mr white keitel mr pink buscemi mr orange roth mr blonde michael madsen mr brown tarantino and mr peach tarantinos chin,positive
most of the movies running time is spent with mr white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive,positive
mr orange meanwhile is on the floor dying from a gunshot wound,positive
the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon leading white to believe one of the five was an informant,positive
the storys background unfolds through a series of flashbacks of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime,positive
eventually blonde arrives with a police officer hostage and what follows is a truly brutal uncomfortable torture scene,positive
lets just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cops ear,positive
a lot of the time reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heistgonewrong movie but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino,positive
the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesnt live up to as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on among other things tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonnas like a virgin,positive
another scene involves roths lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana,positive
neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie,positive
reservoir dogs is good but its no pulp fiction,positive
a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july,positive
from ace ventura to truman burbank jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic yet sympathetic characters,positive
1996s the cable guy was supposed to be his big breakthrough role from zany humor into darker more dramatic acting,positive
as most everyone knows the results were well lessthanstellar,positive
not only did the film not do so hot at the box office but it was also panned by critics,positive
as far as i know gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it,positive
the first time i saw the cable guy in theatres i was in super criticmode and didnt really like it,positive
however due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day ive had time to lean back relax and take in the film,positive
and to my surprise it grew on me,positive
the plot is rather simple broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy played by carrey then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship,positive
see stevens been having some problems with his girlfriend robin leslie mann and he doesnt think he has any more room in his life for a new friend,positive
also some of the cable guys antics have been creeping him out,positive
carrey as the cable guy gives steven various aliases which later we find out are all tv characters larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc he apparently lives in his cable van and while many critics didnt enjoy this newer darker lessmanic performance from carrey i thought it was interesting and rather welldone,positive
for me its not the movie as a whole thats enjoyable but rather several individual scenes a karaoke jam at stevens apartment a medieval fight at a theme restaurant and a bathroom beating a la liar liar just to name a few,positive
perhaps the fact that more of carreys humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny,positive
and if you really want to see something youve got to hear his version of jefferson airplanes somebody to love sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam,positive
the cable guy has its bad spots like most any movie,positive
i didnt particularly like stevens girlfriend and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend,positive
also the ending while having you fooled for a moment is rather contrived and somewhat dissapointing,positive
still i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture if youre at the video store and cant think of anything to rent i suggest you try it out,positive
or if you have hbo just wait till it comes on you wont have to wait long,positive
hell thats what i do every day,positive
near the end of 1996 analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king,positive
the following year 1997 saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia,positive
at best thats all it was a sleeper hit designed to surprise but not shake the industry,positive
in 1998 however things have been decidedly different,positive
there have been a number of pushes on disneys death grip on the market and fiftyone weeks into 98 a new champion has emerged,positive
dreamworks the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed,positive
the other two contenders warner brothers quest for camelot and disneys own annual entry mulan lacked inspiration and drive respectively,positive
although camelot was borderlineabysmal and cant really be considered a shot at the title mulan had the makings of winner,positive
unfortunately it was saturated with traditional disneycute animation and lost points against the rapidlychanging face of the competition,positive
in making the prince of egypt dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product,positive
the animation is flawless and aside from a bugs life is the bestlooking movie to date,positive
the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects and the 2d3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with,positive
the key to success however was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot,positive
namely some of the most important action sequences like the parting of the red sea were done almost entirely in 3d,positive
dreamworks is the first studio to prove that theyve got the stuff of success and that theyre capable of challenging disney,positive
the story is also wellwritten and the characters voiced with talent,positive
for the most part the plot follows its source material the book of exodus although only in the most general sense,positive
the writers took a few creative liberties and most do not damage the story in any way,positive
in fact the shakespearean relationship between moses val kilmer and the pharaoh rameses ralph fiennes makes the story more interesting if anything,positive
moses a hebrew is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile he floats into the pharaoh seti patrick stewart s palace and is taken in by the royal family,positive
moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves,positive
by this time rameses is now pharaoh and the two brothers now on opposite sides of the line face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention,positive
the cast of voices is most impressive and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock jeff goldblum danny glover and steve martin,positive
the script does not have a lot of oneliners in it and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams but overall the story is exciting and interesting,positive
its decidedly for an older crowd and the tykes who havent had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost,positive
but for those who make the bid the prince of egypt can be a great watch,positive
sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to,positive
its not the time or the distance its the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy,positive
yet somehow the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story,positive
the wings of the dove fits the pattern,positive
kate helena bonham carter and merton linus roache are in love,positive
merton a newspaper writer would like to marry kate,positive
but kates job if you will is to be a member of the british upper class,positive
her father lost all of her familys money but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man,positive
naturally a newspaper writers wages dont count as rich,positive
kate leads him on but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder ultimately because hes not marriageable,positive
kates american friend millie alison elliot stops in for a visit on her way to venice,positive
at a party millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees,positive
kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie he might forget about her,positive
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup,positive
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it,positive
he is still in love with kate and will accept no substitute,positive
the three of them along with a fourth friend elizabeth mcgovern end up on holiday in venice together where their interactions are quite complicated,positive
lets sum up millie has fallen for merton,positive
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate,positive
kate loves him but cant marry him so on the one hand shes trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy but on the other hand shes jealous of them as a couple,positive
a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick dying in fact,positive
at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies,positive
millie will leave her money to merton who will then be rich enough to marry kate,positive
she lets merton know of her schemes and since it will help him win kate he reluctantly agrees,positive
kate leaves venice so that the two ms can be alone together,positive
merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her,positive
hes not sure he can separate the two,positive
kate finds that shes not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else,positive
the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved,positive
without revealing the details suffice it to say that the situation ends badly,positive
the title refers to the object of mertons vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament,positive
one is left with feelings of regret and despair,positive
what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed anger and jealousy,positive
an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir,positive
a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after,positive
their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other and after a few things go wrong the whole idea seems like an awful liferuining mistake,positive
i wouldnt call the wings of the dove a film noir but the comparison is interesting,positive
as i have acknowledged before i am not a wonderful judge of acting but i liked the performances from roache and elliot,positive
roache successfully conveyed his characters ambivalence toward millie near the end he hugs her at first staring into space as if hes thinking about his plan with kate then giving that up to fully embrace millie,positive
millies part didnt require as much range but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible,positive
i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same lowtraffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion,positive
their settings are far removed from my personal experience geographically historically and socially,positive
still the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over,positive
if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie from dusk till dawn would probably be it,positive
scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez desperado the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence and is incredibly fun to watch,positive
it starts off as a pulp fictiontype crime story with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store,positive
because this is a tarantino movie however its not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot its a case of a hole being shot through someones hand a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away,positive
the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie everything overdone and nothing as it seems,positive
clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it,positive
harvey keitel plays the backslidden expreacher and juliette lewis his daughter whom registered sexpervert tarantino eyes endlessly,positive
you know youre mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive although shes not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn,positive
the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border clooneys strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet,positive
it does its trick the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind never noticing clooney or tarantino,positive
once they get to mexico its time to wait at the rendezvous point a topless bar called titty twister where were once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper,positive
finally after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him the stripper turns into a vampire,positive
soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back,positive
thats right weve come all this way to see a vampire movie,positive
but like everything else tarantino takes this ageold genre and twists it to his own ends to produce overthetop entertainment,positive
so we get holy water condom balloons heads rolling quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes a lap dog of satan,positive
the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100 tarantino hovering between absurd and disgusting as when theyre entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister but always entertaining and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more secondrate gorefest,positive
clooney keitel and especially tarantino are so overthetop with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously,positive
stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people even if theres absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn,positive
pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment,positive
from dusk till dawn isnt the classic of modern cinema that pf is but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie,positive
seen september 13 1998 at 4 p m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 theater 2 with chris wessell for free using my critics pass,positive
theater rating 12 good seats average sound picture unstable,positive
rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents dont want their kids to see,positive
its not that its a drunken orgy of sex and violence but because its a film that flatout says you can make a career out of gambling,positive
and to take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story,positive
there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life,positive
this film starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing,positive
matt damon stars as mike mcdermott a 20something law student in presentday new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played,positive
damon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voicedover so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting,positive
mikes about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer,positive
but then again he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally,positive
damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectlygroomed features but his narration is what brings it all together,positive
he never sounds like hes reading from a script nor that hes trying to embellish anything it just comes natural to him,positive
the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite,positive
immediately we get the sense that poker isnt for gamblers but for near geniuses with nerves of steel,positive
the game is a quiet war with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers,positive
the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man,positive
the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act,positive
it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit,positive
we learn only a little about mike both past and present,positive
presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling,positive
they go through a few break up cycles until mikes childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison,positive
its not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does,positive
technically the plot isnt unlike many childrens sitcoms in which the good kids bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid,positive
what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story,positive
mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share a passion for outthinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them,positive
where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards hes dealt and works with them,positive
sometimes they pay off i e,positive
his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they dont i e,positive
the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping 30 000 on a single hand,positive
once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood,positive
mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites mansions to taking the tourists at atlantic city to outwitting the gangsters that control it all,positive
everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everythings a battle against the cards destiny deals,positive
one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge martin landou in a perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time,positive
matts good at gambling but hes also got potential to be a great lawyer,positive
he could go professional as either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other theres stability but not much risk involved,positive
can someone whos gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave,positive
if the film had been just a subtle lesson in pokerplaying then the ending is our test,positive
everything is told from mikes perspective but were finally able to recognize some things on our own,positive
this makes the final againstall odds showdown seem like just that,positive
it works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof,positive
what separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end,positive
when i saw the trailer for this film i laughed harder than i had in quite some time,positive
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good,positive
im happy to say that theres something about mary is not one of those trailer letdowns,positive
in fact watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours,positive
the film opens up in flashback to 1985 at a high school in cumberland rhode island,positive
ted stroehmann ben stiller is a social reject who cant seem to get a date to the upcoming prom until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren w,positive
earl brown whos being harassed by one of the school jocks,positive
it seems warrens sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with teds willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite a very real chance of getting beaten up,positive
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom,positive
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name,positive
unfortunately prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital,positive
fast forward to the present where ted has cleaned himself up now writes for a magazine but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years mary whom he hasnt seen since that fateful day,positive
with the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love,positive
however when pat finds mary he falls for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affections,positive
theres something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin,positive
not exactly intelligent comedies they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or coworkers to think you had such a great time watching them,positive
with their current film the farrelly brothers have come up with something youll not only enjoy but also wont mind talking about the next day at the water cooler,positive
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles from the subtle to the ridiculous and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films they almost all work,positive
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on,positive
one minute youll be laughing at something ted says and the next youll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of marys apartment,positive
one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller,positive
he is perfectly cast in the role of ted because hes a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation,positive
teds a nice fellow and tries to do his best but for some reason or another things just dont always work out,positive
its comical but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top,positive
actually ive liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mideighties,positive
the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money,positive
in it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become a bigtime bowling hustler,positive
it was parody at its finest more of which showed up in the shortlived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late 92early 93,positive
like the critic which aired on abc then fox i still mourn that shows cancellation,positive
cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paperthin at times,positive
however diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why shes got guys just falling over each other to be with her,positive
heck i even found her laugh to be cute even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week,positive
my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesnt change and you know its really true,positive
he and ralph macchio must hang out or something,positive
maybe they live in dick clarks pool house,positive
anyway heres another good piece of casting as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into marys heart,positive
the supporting performances are also good,positive
chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy,positive
lin shae who plays marys neighbor magda and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin provides some good laughs especially in scenes with her benjilike dog which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film,positive
lee evans as marys friend tucker displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist,positive
the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there arent any noticeable times where the film drags,positive
the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes,positive
they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plotrelevant information right toward the camera,positive
its a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film,positive
after that it got a little annoying and its unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow,positive
fortunately filled with sight gags humorous lines and solid comedic acting theres something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater,positive
now lets first look into the history of shark films,positive
there was the unforgettable jaws,positive
the exciting jaws 2 the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i cant seem to recall about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that,positive
now with the magic of cgi one shark is simply not enough in deep blue sea there are 3 big mean and really smart ones,positive
russell frankiln jackson visits aquatica a seabound research center where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimers disease,positive
the substance is small in quantity and because of this lead researcher dr susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones,positive
as sure as the sun sets in the west a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure,positive
with the flexibility offered by cgi the sharks get more fulllength screen time as their predecessors did in those remotecontrolled rubber suit days,positive
gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after,positive
this time we get to see the entire gobbling action with floating limbs and all,positive
soso acting expected in most of your average action film,positive
jackson fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace takes on the darkside force of a different kind and fits well with his wisecracking lines,positive
ll cool js cook role as preacher does for this film what steven seagals cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films,positive
deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer,positive
it does however prove to be a refreshing followup within the genre full of visual thrills suspense and believe it or not humour,positive
its like jurassic park under water,positive
nothing too stressful pure entertainment,positive
renny harlin you are forgiven for making cutthroat island,positive
